  <description>Dear Santa,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want Keller James for Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not fall for him, no matter how charming or irresistible or famous he is. I will not be swayed by his skills in the kitchen or by his British accent. I’m going to win the Great Gingerbread Bake Off and no one is going to stand in my way. Not even Keller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kisses are off. I mean all bets. All bets are off. And his clothes, those are off too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grr, never mind. I’ll figure this out myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO, &lt;br /&gt;Ginger Winter</description>

  <description>Dear Santa,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring me a new boss for Christmas. Mine is the worst. The worst, hidden in a six foot tall package of male perfection. It’d be easier if he looked like an old Scrooge, wouldn’t it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Saint-Croix doesn’t look like an old scrooge. He’s hot as-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um, never mind. Just bring me a new boss. Please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Holly Winter</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />This is a short fab fun read and my first Christmas romance of the year.<br /><br />It’s what I think of as the perfect 3* read. There’s no depth or real story. But the characters are likeable and it’s a fun, hot Christmas read. It’s not a book I’ll re-read but I will be continuing on with If You...]]>

  <description>In a matter of days, Dex has been kidnapped, tortured, killed, revived, become half Therian, offered the chance to become a spy, and accepted a proposal to marry his jaguar Therian boyfriend, Sloane Brodie. It’s been a lot to take in, and although Dex is still trying to wrap his head around everything that’s happened, he knows he has to move forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the events of Smoke &amp;amp; Mirrors, Dex and Sloane find themselves in one of the most frightening situations of all: revealing the truth to their Destructive Delta family. When the dust settles, nothing will ever be the same, and it’s up to Dex to prove that in the face of change, the one thing that will always remain the same is family.</description>

  <description>Life for Dexter J. Daley has never been easy, but he’s always found a way to pick himself back up with a smile on his face. Taken from his home, and the arms of his boyfriend and THIRDS partner, Sloane Brodie, Dex finds himself in a situation as mysterious and lethal as the Therian interrogating him. Dex learns what he’s secretly believed all along: his parents’ death wasn’t an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovering the whole truth about John and Gina Daley’s homicide sets off a series of events that will change Dex and Sloane’s lives forever. As buried secrets rise to the surface and new truths are revealed, Dex and Sloane’s love for each other is put to the test, with more than their relationship on the line. If traversing the waters of murder and secret government agencies wasn’t enough, something inexplicable has been happening to Dex—and nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>Calvin Summers and Ethan Hobbs have been best friends since childhood, but somewhere along the line, their friendship evolved into something more. With the Therian Youth Center bombing, Calvin realizes just how short life can be and no longer keeps his feelings for his best friend a secret. Unfortunately, change is difficult for Ethan; most days he does well to deal with his Selective Mutism and Social Anxiety. Calvin’s confession adds a new struggle for Ethan, one he fears might cost him the friendship that’s been his whole world for as long as he can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As partners and Defense Agents at the THIRDS, being on Destructive Delta is tough at the best of times, but between call-outs and life-threatening situations, Calvin and Ethan not only face traversing the challenges of their job, but also working toward a future as more than friends.</description>

  <description>As the fiercest Defense Agent at the THIRDS, Destructive Delta’s Ash Keeler is foul-mouthed and foul-tempered. But his hard-lined approach always yields results, evident by his recent infiltration of the Coalition. Thanks to Ash’s skills and the help of his team, they finally put an end to the murdering extremist group for good, though not before Ash takes a bullet to save teammate Cael Maddock. As a result, Ash’s secrets start to surface, and he can no longer ignore what’s in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cael Maddock is no stranger to heartache. As a Recon Agent for Destructive Delta, he has successfully maneuvered through the urban jungle that is New York City, picking up his own scars along the way. Yet nothing he’s ever faced has been more of a challenge than the heart of Ash Keeler, his supposedly straight teammate. Being in love isn’t the only danger he and Ash face as wounds reopen and new secrets emerge, forcing them to question old loyalties.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;THIRDS: Book Four&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an attack by the Coalition leaves THIRDS Team Leader Sloane Brodie critically injured, agent Dexter J. Daley swears to make Beck Hogan pay for what he’s done. But Dex’s plans for retribution are short-lived. With Ash still on leave with his own injuries, Sloane in the hospital, and Destructive Delta in the Coalition’s crosshairs, Lieutenant Sparks isn’t taking any chances. Dex’s team is pulled from the case, with the investigation handed to Team Leader Sebastian Hobbs. Dex refuses to stand by while another team goes after Hogan, and decides to put his old HPF detective skills to work to find Hogan before Theta Destructive, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a lengthy and painful recovery ahead of him, the last thing Sloane needs is his partner out scouring the city, especially when the lies—however well-intentioned—begin to spiral out of control. Sloane is all too familiar with the desire to retaliate, but some things are more important, like the man who’s pledged to stand beside him. As Dex starts down a dark path, it’s up to Sloane to show him what’s at stake, and finally put a name to what’s in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>New York City’s streets are more dangerous than ever with the leaderless Order of Adrasteia and the Ikelos Coalition, a newly emerged Therian group, at war. Innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire and although the THIRDS round up more and more members of the Order in the hopes of keeping the volatile group from reorganizing, the members of the Coalition continue to escape and wreak havoc in the name of vigilante justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, someone inside the THIRDS has been feeding the Coalition information. It’s up to Destructive Delta to draw out the mole and put an end to the war before anyone else gets hurt. But to get the job done, the team will have to work through the aftereffects of the Therian Youth Center bombing. A skirmish with Coalition members leads Agent Dexter J. Daley to a shocking discovery and suddenly it becomes clear that the random violence isn’t so random. There’s more going on than Dex and Sloane originally believed, and their fiery partnership is put to the test. As the case takes an explosive turn, Dex and Sloane are in danger of losing more than their relationship.</description>

  <description>When a series of bombs go off in a Therian youth center, injuring members of THIRDS Team Destructive Delta, and causing a rift between agents Dexter J. Daley and Sloane Brodie, peace seems unattainable. Especially when a new and frightening group, the Order of Adrasteia, appears to always be a step ahead. With panic and intolerance spreading and streets becoming littered with the Order’s propaganda, hostility between Humans and Therians grows daily. Dex and Sloane, along with the rest of the team, are determined to take down the Order and restore peace, not to mention settle a personal score. But the deeper the team investigates the bombings, the more they believe there’s a more sinister motive than a desire to shed blood and spread chaos.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Discovering the frightful truth behind the Order’s intent forces Sloane to confront secrets from a past he thought he’d left behind for good, a past that could not only destroy him and his career, but also the reputation of the organization that made him all he is today. Now more than ever, Dex and Sloane need each other, and, along with trust, the strength of their bond will mean the difference between justice and all-out war.</description>

  <description>When homicide detective Dexter J. Daley’s testimony helps send his partner away for murder, the consequences—and the media frenzy—aren’t far behind. He soon finds himself sans boyfriend, sans friends, and, after an unpleasant encounter in a parking garage after the trial, he’s lucky he doesn’t find himself sans teeth. Dex fears he’ll get transferred from the Human Police Force’s Sixth Precinct, or worse, get dismissed. Instead, his adoptive father—a sergeant at the Therian-Human Intelligence Recon Defense Squadron otherwise known as the THIRDS—pulls a few strings, and Dex gets recruited as a Defense Agent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dex is determined to get his life back on track and eager to get started in his new job. But his first meeting with Team Leader Sloane Brodie, who also happens to be his new jaguar Therian partner, turns disastrous. When the team is called to investigate the murders of three HumaniTherian activists, it soon becomes clear to Dex that getting his partner and the rest of the tightknit team to accept him will be a lot harder than catching the killer—and every bit as dangerous.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The wedding is off, but the love story is just beginning.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Betrayed the night before his wedding by the supposed boy of his dreams, Ethan Robinson escapes the devastating fallout by going on his honeymoon alone to the other side of the world. Hard of hearing and still struggling with the repercussions of being late-deafened, traveling by himself leaves him feeling painfully isolated with his raw, broken heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clay Kelly never expected to be starting life over in his forties. He got hitched young, but now his wife has divorced him and remarried, his kids are grown, and he’s left his rural Outback town. In a new career driving a tour bus on Australia’s East Coast, Clay reckons he's happy enough. He enjoys his cricket, a few beers, and a quiet life. If he's a bit lonely, it's not the end of the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clay befriends Ethan, hoping he can cheer up the sad-eyed young man, and a crush on an unattainable straight guy is exactly the safe distraction Ethan needs. Yet as the days pass and their connection grows, long-repressed desires surface in Clay, and they are shocked to discover romance sparking. Clay is the sexy, rugged &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt; of Ethan’s dreams, and as the clock counts down on their time together, neither wants this honeymoon to end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Honeymoon for One&lt;/i&gt; is a gay romance by Keira Andrews featuring a May-December age difference, a slow burn of newfound friends to lovers, first-time m/m sex, and of course a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Miles, a powerful mage, thinks life is right where he wants it. With a werewolf, a witch, and a demon in his house, what could go wrong? When fifteen people die at the same time in different locations, things start to look a bit bleak. The police are looking for someone to help, someone worthy of helping, but instead they get stuck with Miles and his demon Havoc, whose weakness is any woman that looks his way. They have been together for hundreds of years and, when things start to go wrong, they may be the only two that can save humanity. Which is really sad because they’re definitely not cut out to save humanity. When an attack leaves Miles’s life in Havoc’s hands the two start to question if there’s something more between them other than three hundred years of bickering. Along with a forest spirit, a perverted minotaur, and the two human detectives (that wish they’d have asked for help from anyone else), Miles and Havoc try to find the answer to their happy ending. No, not that happy ending you pervert. Okay maybe there’s that kind of happy ending too. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;On Australia's hottest beach, a lifeguard and surfer sizzle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barking Beach lifeguard Damian "Damo" Williams has never been with a guy. But he's...wondered. Imagined. Fantasized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While rescuing a terrified swimmer who threatens to overpower him, he gets unexpected backup from surfer Blake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Blake asks him out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not in so many words, and since Damo's always identified as straight, it's not like it's a date. Right? But here's his opportunity to see what it would be like with a bloke. A muscular bloke who wears guyliner and sexy skintight clubwear when he's not riding waves. A bloke with the confidence to give Damo exactly what he's secretly been craving and leave him begging for more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swept Away&lt;/i&gt; is a bonus short story from Keira Andrews featuring characters from the novel &lt;i&gt;Flash Rip&lt;/i&gt;. This free LGBT romance includes bisexuality exploration, first-time mm sex, and of course a happy ending.</description>

He needs to uncover her secrets, but doing so may ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His obsession could destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s determined to escape.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Yulia Tzakova, her captor is the man of both her dreams and her nightmares: tender one moment, cruel the next. She can’t let him crack her, but resisting him may leave her broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A moment of weakness could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37777162-capture-me" rel="nofollow"&gt;B015M4GQR4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new dark romance series from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Twist Me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She fears him from the first moment she sees him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yulia Tzakova is no stranger to dangerous men. She grew up with them. She survived them. But when she meets Lucas Kent, she knows the hard ex-soldier may be the most dangerous of them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night—that’s all it should be. A chance to make up for a failed assignment and get information on Kent’s arms dealer boss. When his plane goes down, it should be the end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Instead, it's just the beginning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He wants her from the first moment he sees her.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lucas Kent has always liked leggy blondes, and Yulia Tzakova is as beautiful as they come. The Russian interpreter might’ve tried to seduce his boss, but she ends up in Lucas’s bed—and he has every intention of seeing her there again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then his plane goes down, and he learns the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She betrayed him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now she will pay.</description>

Held captive for 15 months.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reads like one of those headlines. And yes, I did it. I stole her. Nora, with her long dark hair and silky skin. She’s my weakness, my obsession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a good man. I never pretended to be one. She can love me, but she can’t change me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can, however, change her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Julian Esguerra, and Nora is mine to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Keep Me&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to &lt;i&gt;Twist Me&lt;/i&gt;, told from Nora &amp;amp; Julian’s POV.***</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36313393-twist-me" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00IC8E3MI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;***New Adult Dark Erotic Novel***&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Kidnapped. Taken to a private island.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought this could happen to me. I never imagined one chance meeting on the eve of my eighteenth birthday could change my life so completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I belong to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. To Julian. To a man who is as ruthless as he is beautiful – a man whose touch makes me burn. A man whose tenderness I find more devastating than his cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My captor is an enigma. I don’t know who he is or why he took me. There is a darkness inside him – a darkness that scares me even as it draws me in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Nora Leston, and this is my story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;WARNING: This is NOT a traditional romance. It contains disturbing subject matter, including themes of questionable consent and Stockholm Syndrome, as well as graphic sexual content. This is a work of fiction intended for a mature, 18+ audience only. The author neither endorses nor condones this type of behavior.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Holiday Omegas: Book One &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonny is an omega witch with a huge crush on the alpha bear shifter next door. Unfortunately, every time they meet, Sonny’s normal sassy personality disappears and he becomes a shy, babbling idiot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leo is captivated by the adorable kitchen witch that lives in his apartment building, but what could Leo possibly offer him? Thanks to his ex, Leo knows he’s not exactly the greatest catch. The problem is, Leo’s bear knows Sonny is his mate. &lt;br /&gt;Fed up with their awkward mating dance, Sonny and Leo’s friends decide All Hallows’ Eve is the perfect time to cause a little mischief to bring the two together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author's Note: 10,000 word short story. This is a paranormal omegaverse love story with no angst and no cheating. There are a few potty mouths, so beware. 18+ readers only, please. This series also contains mpreg, though it is not seen in this book.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jackson &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that Leland’s decided to give up his life as a hitman and take a walk on the mild side, we’ve been enjoying a simple life of taking down bad guys the legal way. I didn’t know he would be just as reckless as a PI, but it’s not my fault if I happen to enjoy helping him hunt down the occasional criminal. If only I could keep the house from being overrun by Leland’s gun shrine—or stop him from making our cases “more exciting” by terrorizing people into confessing. Overall, life seems perfect, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt;We’ve been called in to investigate a suspicious murder committed by someone claiming to be the Sandman. When we find a note on the victim’s body, we realize that this could ruin our lives forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leland:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t involved in the murder. It might look like my writing and my note, but I wouldn’t do that to Jackson—especially after I promised him that I wouldn’t take a hit ever again. At least, not without telling him. I’m finally starting to learn that we’re stronger together, and I’m not going to jeopardize that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luckily for both of us, this copycat doesn’t know who he’s dealing with. Game’s on, fake Sandman. You think you can mess with me? Well, maybe you can, but that’s beside the point, because I will protect Jackson no matter what, even if I almost drown him in the process. (Really, that wasn’t my fault. He should learn how to swim better.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This 110k word book contains: Disco ball piñata, camping with Sasquatch, an acrobatic housekeeper named “Mr. Cleanyface,” a questionable massage table, weapons everywhere, Jackson’s nemesis—the fence, a turkey showdown, aerial silk antics, a reappearance of Blow-up Randy, over-the-top body armor, too many hitmen, and so many emotions that Leland’s chest might explode. This is the second book in a series—while you could read and enjoy it on its own, you really should read The Hitman’s Guide to Making Friends and Finding Love for maximum enjoyment. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

I just can’t praise this enough.<br /><br />I adored Leland, Jackson and the whole host of supporting characters. I did intend to move straight onto her Darkness series but I feel my hubby...]]>

  <description>When Felix is hired to take care of a recently blinded man, he thinks his life might finally be turning around. It has to be better than where he came from, but he has no idea what he’s signed up for. Lane is depressed, rude, and difficult to be around. It doesn’t help that Felix is clearly not qualified for the job, especially since he can’t even make oatmeal right. But Felix is trying to make his life better, so he’ll put up with the man even if it requires some unconventional methods. Felix’s humor soon pulls Lane out of his depression, and Felix feels like things are finally going right in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he’s attacked by someone who wants to keep Lane quiet. It’s clear that Lane isn’t who he’s pretending to be, and Felix should probably walk away. But Felix has finally found a place where he belongs and he’s willing to go to great lengths to stay by Lane’s side. Even if it involves kidnapping, stealing, and Felix’s overwhelmingly bad ideas, Felix will do just about anything because Lane is there for him unlike anyone else has ever been. Felix might be out of his element, but one thing he is sure about is that he doesn’t want to leave Lane… even if it costs him his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hidden in Darkness is 90k words of snark, car chases, and morally questionable choices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Newly edited with an updated cover.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I have such mixed feelings on this book. <br /><br />Having just read and loved the two Hitman books this seemed like the natural progression.<br /><br />There’s a lot here to like. Both Felix and Lane for example. Plus there’s never a dull moment. There’s also a light humour and sarcasm running through it....]]>

  <description>Being in love with your best friend is hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henry’s the odd man out. All his friends are settling down, and his reputation as the Hook-Up King of London seems more like a curse than a blessing these days. Especially when it keeps photojournalist Ivo, his best friend and the brilliant man he’s loved since they were fifteen, at arm’s length. But that’s where Ivo wants him, right? Putting aside his feelings, Henry decides to give up casual sex and look for the real deal. After all, he has no chance with Ivo - or does he? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henry is everything to Ivo. Best friend, soul mate, the one person who has never let him down. The one person he is loyal to above everything and everyone. But Henry’s in a box marked best friend and that’s where Ivo’s kept him for nearly twenty years, despite steadily falling in love with the gentle man. And besides, why would Henry want to date Ivo? Burned out and injured, he’s the walking embodiment of damaged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Distance has helped Henry and Ivo keep a lid on their attraction, but when they find themselves in the same city for a change—Ivo hurt and needing assistance, and Henry more than willing to provide it—the two best friends grow closer than ever, forcing a realization, and a decision. Risk their friendship for their hearts? Or can they have both? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of Rule Breaker and Deal Maker comes a tender love story about two best friends who are perfect for each other, and always have been - if only they knew it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the third book in the Mixed Messages series, but it can be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>First Published 1 July 2017 &lt;br /&gt;KATHERINE &lt;br /&gt;The day Antonio walked into my Café I knew things were about to change. He had this presence about him, and I could see shadows in his eyes of things I could never understand. But he was like a force of nature, taking what he wanted, when he wanted. He was big, strong, and had eyes the color of the finest chocolate. Everything he made me feel, scared the hell out of me. When he opened his mouth, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to slap him or kiss him, he made every nerve in my body come alive. But, I have a secret. I didn’t want to let him go but its better this way. I have let enough people down in my life so, I tried to distance myself, and push him away. I never thought I could love, or trust, any man after my father left, but Antonio was here to prove me wrong, and he wasn’t going to back down. &lt;br /&gt;Kitten: Antonio was determined to take me to my knees and crack me wide open. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ANTONIO &lt;br /&gt;Katherine was the kind of woman you could only ever dream up in your wildest fantasies. A woman who oozed sex kitten with every sway of her hips, and she had the attitude to go with it. With hair like fire, and eyes as blue as the sky on a clear summer’s day, that body of hers I swear had a direct line to my cock. Then, she pushed me away, but I don’t go down that easy. I didn’t get to where I am today without fighting tooth and nail for it. Katherine was mine and no matter how long it took me, I was going to make her see she belonged to me, just like I already belonged to her. I know she is hiding something, I can see it in her eyes every time she looks at me. I don’t care what I have to do, or how long it takes, I will find out what it is. My kitten isn’t the only one with secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Antonio: Katherine brought me to my knees, and I was going to take her down with me.</description>

  <description>Zeb Evans doesn’t do messy.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product of a disorganised and chaotic childhood, Zeb likes order and control, and as the boss of his own employment agency he can give that to himself. Life runs along strict lines and he never mixes business with pleasure. Everything in his life lives in neat, alphabetized boxes. Until Jesse.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jesse Reed is Zeb’s complete opposite. He’s chaos personified. A whirling cyclone of disorder. He’s also charming and funny and a very unwanted distraction.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is why it comes as a complete surprise to Zeb to find himself asking Jesse to pose as his boyfriend for a few days in the country at a wedding.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zeb doesn’t do impulsive, but as the time away progresses, he finds himself increasingly drawn to the merry and irreverent Jesse. But can he bring himself to break the hard-won lessons he’s learnt in life? And even if he can, how could Jesse be attracted to him anyway? He’s so much older than Jesse, not to mention being his boss.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of the Mixed Messages and Finding Home series comes a warm and funny romance about one man’s fight for control and another man’s determination to circumvent it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the first book in the Close Proximity series, but it can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Sometimes your mouth makes deals that your heart can’t honour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude is a highly successful model, but a very reluctant one. His life is full of casual hook-ups with pretty men in glamorous locations, but it’s still empty. However, circumstances decreed a long time ago that this was his path, so he’s resolutely stayed on it and accepted his fate with good grace. He made a deal with himself and his hook-ups. Get in, get out and no ties with anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, an accident at home one night leads to him making a new deal and accepting the offer of help from an unlikely source. It leads to an unexpected summer of falling in love with a larger than life man and his child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But by the end of the summer his reasons for not staying are still valid. Will he turn away? Can he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asa is a talented actor who has spent time away from the scene to look after his son. But now he’s back, and the last thing he needs are complications from the gorgeous man who is staying with him. Scarred from too many betrayals, he has no intention of forming a lasting tie with anyone. However, he can’t resist the beautiful man with secrets, and to his horror he develops feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a deal’s a deal and they said it was just for the summer. What can Asa do with a man who has forever in his eyes and goodbye on his lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Amazon bestselling author of ‘Rule Breaker’ comes another scorchingly hot romantic comedy.</description>

  <description>A shadow meets the light … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone needs to disappear, the Chicago mob calls on Joe Rossi. A man who can move without a sound, and kill without a word, they don’t call him the Shadow for nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, it’s a New York crime family in need of his skills, but it takes one glimpse of her to make him agree to the job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liliana Marcello is every inch a principessa della mafia. Her life has taught her to be wary of strangers, yet her ballet career contradicts everything by putting her on display. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a man with a dark smile and a constantly changing demeanor that makes her feel safe again, but it’s the unknown that holds her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes one look … &lt;br /&gt;One dance …&lt;br /&gt;One word … &lt;br /&gt;One smile to captivate a man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one second to kill a woman because of it, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all monsters hide in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;How are you supposed to see them coming?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to the Endgame trilogy where blood is thick, but passion is thicker…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t believe in fairy-tale endings…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They used to call Evan Bishop the golden boy. He had it all and was about to close the business deal of a lifetime, then marry the woman of his dreams. But everything goes to hell when a faceless enemy wants to destroy his family’s empire and see him dead. Except the bomb meant to kill him fails. He wakes up from a coma to find his face scarred and his brother missing and wanted for murder. Now that he’s damaged, he hides away from the world—including the woman he loves. He refuses to be a burden to her, so even though it destroys him, he sets her free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s about to prove him wrong…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isla MacDonald isn’t walking away from Evan just because he’s decided to shut her out of his life. He blames himself for the bombing that got her father killed and nearly killed him—but he’s wrong. After all attempts to see him fail, with a broken heart she tries to resume her life and take over her father’s firm. Though it’s not her dream, she wants to honor his legacy and finish the deal that will save thousands of jobs. But when someone tries to kill her—twice—she needs a bodyguard. To her surprise Evan steps up and insists on protecting her, putting on a show as the caring fiancé. But he won’t let her back into his life or into his heart. To have any chance at a future together, they’ll have to resurrect the past and stay alive long enough to expose the man determined to see them both dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author note: This book can be read as a stand-alone, complete with HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Princess Charlotte’s 18th birthday vacation is about to take a turn toward adventure. Off the northwest coast of Alkebulan, far from her home of Swerighe, Charlotte and her maid Caroline are kidnapped, spirited away on a pirate ship pulled by giant manta rays, and sold as slaves to a reclusive sheikh. But Charlotte is having none of that. How dare they treat her like this? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The determined northlander and her servant are soon joined by Khepri, a healer in the employ of the sheikh, and Christianne, a fellow slave, in a daring plot to regain their freedom. But so much stands in their way, from marauders and a deadly manticore, to a mysterious oasis that holds secrets they can’t begin to fathom. The odds are against Charlotte and her companions surviving and making their way back home. Alkebulan can be a dangerous place for a foreign princess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte will be forced to make some major adjustments if she and the others are to survive this journey. Just when Charlotte thinks she’s home free, she discovers the real reason she was kidnapped. Dark deceit and ancient prophecy swirl around her and threaten to swallow her whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught between two warring factions, Charlotte is pulled into a world of supernatural alchemy and unearthly magic where nothing is as it seems and even the simplest of sights cannot be trusted. She will have to have to shed her old paradigm and completely re-invent herself if she is to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cold cases, murder, lies, and an unimaginable truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney detective August Shaw has spent the last decade of work solving cold cases. Since the death of his boyfriend eight years ago, August works alone, lives alone, is alone — and that’s exactly how he likes it. His work is his entire life, and he’s convinced a string of unsolved cold-case suicides are linked to what could be Australia’s worst ever serial killer. Problem is, no one believes him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Constable Jacob Porter loves his life in the small town of Tallowwood in the middle of the rainforests in northern New South Wales. He runs summer camps for the local Indigenous kids, plays rugby with his mates, has a close family, and he’s the local LGBTQIA+ Liaison and the Indigenous Liaison Officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When human remains are found in the camping grounds at Tallowwood Reserve, Jake’s new case turns out to be linked to August’s cold cases, and Jake agrees they’re not suicides at all. With Jacob now firmly in August’s corner, they face one hurdle after another, even when more remains are found, they still can’t seem to gain ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the body of a fellow police officer turns up under the same MO, it can’t be ignored anymore. August and Jake must trace the untraceable before the killer takes his next victim or before he stops one of them, permanently.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>While twenty-year-old FTM Hemingway is making an excellent living as a tattoo artist in a near-future version of Hell’s Kitchen, the rest of the country is splintered and struggling in the wake of a war gone on for too long. Technology has collapsed, borders rise and fall overnight, and magic has awakened without rhyme, reason, or rule, turning average unwitting citizens into wielders of strange and specific strands of magic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hemingway’s particular brand of magic has made him a household name. Not only is he a talented artist, but his work comes to life. Literally.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When NYC’s most infamous serial killer—the East River Ripper—abducts Hemingway’s best friend, Grace, he has only days to save her. Hemingway teams up with his stoic cop roommate to hunt for the killer and rescue Grace before she becomes the Ripper’s latest victim. But as the duo chase clues to the serial killer’s identity, Hemingway begins to fear the magic he and the Ripper share might eventually corrupt him too.</description>

  <description>HEAT ღ HUMOR ღ HEA &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jack Johansson is a temperamental, foul-mouthed biker that only reveals his softer side to his closest family. As a legacy member of the Reapers, he’s always gotten what he wanted. He even became the Conroe Chapter’s VP without breaking a sweat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now he’s met a woman whose life has been anything but easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Georgia only recently freed herself from an angry, oppressive man. The last thing she needs is to become a doormat again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she’s drawn to the tatted biker despite realizing he might be more dangerous than the last man she trusted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can the hotheaded hunk woo the wary heart of the woman who inspires him to be better? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heart Like Mine contains graphic sexual content, violent situations, and harsh language. The book is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. Trigger warning topics: past spousal abuse and miscarriage.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Johansson’s are one of my favourite fiction families. I love Bijou’s sarcastic writing style and her flawed but real characters.<br /><br />Georgia was fourteen when she got pregnant. He was way older, controlling and a complete arsehole.

  <description>One Touch...One Kiss...Forever Connected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of sheer desperation, Nyssa Das accepted a job as an escort. Nothing, however, prepared her for the utterly delicious Deacon Smith, his sexually manipulative smile, or just about every other body part. By morning she’d broken all the agency rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That, was six months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an event coordinator, Nyssa’s been given her dream job. To plan the wedding of the year: Multi billionaire, Tyler Bennett. ‘Holy freaking hell’ is her response when she meets Tyler Bennett aka Deacon Smith. He’s just given ‘surprise’ a hot as hell new meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fulfill the obligations set by his grandfather’s Will, Tyler reluctantly agrees to an arranged marriage. When he discovers his wedding planner is none other than Sherry Rose aka Nyssa Das, he believes the universe works in mysterious ways, even for a playboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dismayed with the discovery, Nyssa is all set to hand over the planning to another coordinator. Tyler, however, has no intention of letting her escape a second time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what Tyler wants, he gets.</description>

  <description>Kids adore him.&lt;br /&gt;Women pant after him.&lt;br /&gt;When he kisses her—she hears the angels sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But single mom Kate Gilletti has her hands full as it is. Falling for the hunky single-dad every woman in town is hot for—is not on her Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what, if the looks he gives her could melt the North Pole? She has no plans to get involved with another man who looks like sin on a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe this Christmas, Kate will learn that some men are totally worth melting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors note: This is meant to be a yummy, funny and sexy holiday read that will leave you feeling all mushy and gooey... like a melting piece of chocolate Santa stuffed into a stocking hanging on a mantel on Christmas Eve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Cheating, HEA with plenty of fire to melt those Kindles. I hope you fall in love with Gianni just as Kate did!</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Patton Fletcher is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Demanding,&lt;br /&gt;✔Driven,&lt;br /&gt;✔Sexy AF, and&lt;br /&gt;✔My New Boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister says don’t fall for him. I say don’t worry.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not about to let some arrogant, young CEO derail my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;Or insult my wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t care about his deep brown eyes or the way the muscle moves in his square jaw when he’s pissed.&lt;br /&gt;I won’t fall for his power or how sexy he fills out that suit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I said I could resist him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I was wrong…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Raquel Morgan is Trouble.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s stubborn, independent, and a fighter.&lt;br /&gt;She has long, dark hair, crystal blue eyes, and freckles…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Freckles.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And long, sexy legs.&lt;br /&gt;And a smart mouth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent seven years building one of the top companies in Nashville, and I’m not about to let some ambitious, cardigan-wearing new kid distract me from my goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raquel Morgan won’t tempt me.&lt;br /&gt;I’m The Boss, and &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I never lose control…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(BOSS OF ME is a STAND-ALONE workplace, enemies to lovers, military romance with a badass alpha boss and the feisty woman who steals his heart. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Haven Hart stands on the edge of good and evil. Having balance between the two is the only thing keeping the town from crumbling to the ground. For years, one man has been charged with maintaining that balance. Poe. &lt;br /&gt;The air of mystery surrounding Poe is one of necessity. He’s the keeper of secrets and for good reason. He’s stood alone against the most ruthless men and women, always hiding behind the curtain to help his friends defeat what seeks to destroy them. &lt;br /&gt;Now, after all this time, the city he loves, the people he has protected, and the secrets he’s kept hidden are in serious jeopardy. Poe will need the help of his friends to fight the ultimate battle; not just save Haven Hart but everything and everyone he holds dear to him. &lt;br /&gt;When the dust settles, will betrayals be forgiven? Will the city still be standing? Will Poe’s beloved be at his side or will everything crumble? One thing is for certain, everything will be tested, and questions will finally be answered. Raven’s Hart is the final installment in the Haven Hart Series. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A Standalone Second Chance Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a man tells you he’s no good for you, best heed the warning. I learned the hard way. I had Jake Basson’s baby. He left to chase his dream. Now he’s back, demanding a second chance, but why should I give him anything after four years of nothing? No correspondence, no news. I finally have my life back on track. Jake has never been uncomplicated. He never follows the rules. I should’ve known he’d play dirty. He caught me once. I’m not going to let him catch me twice.</description>

  <description>BUCK &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want two things in life: a woman and a child. &lt;br /&gt;When I walk into the diner and see Rosie, I think my motherf*cking dreams have come true. &lt;br /&gt;We share one stolen afternoon, but then she’s gone. &lt;br /&gt;Eight months later she shows up at my cabin. &lt;br /&gt;Her belly swollen, her breasts full, and with the face of an angel. &lt;br /&gt;Still, she wants to keep on running. &lt;br /&gt;No way in hell am I letting her go. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not just Rosie that needs my protection––our babies do too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ROSIE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Arranged marriages may be fine for some girls, but I’m not some girls. &lt;br /&gt;I’m on the run with one goal: avoid my uncle and the plans he has for me. &lt;br /&gt;What starts as a reckless afternoon, suddenly becomes a life tethered to a man I barely know. &lt;br /&gt;I thought a pregnancy would buy my freedom. &lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;And my uncle is ready to make someone pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Darling You, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUCKED is a stand alone story that is packed with true love and a man who knows what he wants: his woman. He fights for her like a real mountain man knows how to do!</description>

  <description>Marry Clementine Bright or watch your carefully crafted kingdom crumble. &lt;br /&gt;Well played, Grandfather. Well played. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll say my I do's and pretend to be the doting husband, but this is one union that’s strictly a marriage of inconvenience. Clementine may be disarmingly beautiful, but she defies me at every turn. I'm the king of my castle. The ruler of my bedroom. And even though I want her, I’ll fight the urge to have her, until death do us part.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.75*<br /><br />I moved straight onto this after finishing Bride. I enjoyed it. <br /><br />Yes it’s another short read but the story moves forward and we get the answers we wanted. <br /><br />I liked both Gabriel and Clementine. I did struggle a bit with Clementine keeping secrets. It’s generally a huge no no for me....]]>

  <description>Folks in town call him a monster — say he’s dangerous. But I know him simply as Elijah Hays, the quiet, gentle giant who works with the horses on my ranch. I can feel him watching me, that steady intense gaze making me crave things I don’t quite understand, burn in a way that frightens me. He’s always kept his distance… until that night.&lt;p&gt;I remember him coming to my rescue, me following him into the barn, giving him his first taste of a woman, and his inexperienced yet barely reined touch turning me to ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all I can think about is exposing the dark desire I see deep inside him — having him turn those dark desires on me. That low, gritty voice rasping orders in my ear. Those huge, rough hands holding me down when a storm blows in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want his surrender. His control. I want to break him… and have him break me…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Trigger &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tess was under the Devil’s watch while I suffered behind bars with my demons… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ace in my pocket brings power, and the temptation to flip overwhelms me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m playing chicken with the reaper, and it’s only feeding his thirst. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The smell of blood is a drug. It fuels me. Consumes me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am lost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tess &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Devil stole me, but I refuse to belong to someone else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a fighter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will do whatever it takes to get back to my family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Treachery and betrayal surround us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only way out is to turn the greatest loss into the greatest victory. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>***This book ends with a small cliffhanger. Intended for 18+. May contain Triggers.*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was raised by the Devil himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Formed into a man who was unreachable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went from the boy with bruises to the man with a trigger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Killing is the only thing that calms the itch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The demons inside were a constant battle… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…until she changed everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Problem is when you spend most of your time in the dark, is it smart to step into the light?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and make their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six Men of Haven bleed by: taking what they want, always watching each other's backs and loving the women they claim with unyielding tenderness and fierce passion.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no code Knox Torren can't break. He knows no limits when it comes to uncovering intel, especially on anyone who crosses his family. But a skip tracer with a sketchy history presents a puzzle he can't solve. When he finally meets the statuesque blonde with the intoxicating Russian accent, he'll try anything to unearth her secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darya Volkova has been living under an assumed identity for years. Searching for a job that will take her out of the dangerous life she's built, she has her sights set on Knox: the best hacker in the business. From their first meeting, though, something far more intimate than a professional connection develops.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darya must overcome still-healing wounds to trust that Knox will take care of her in all the ways she needs. And Knox will do whatever it takes to make sure whatever—or whomever—she's running from never touches his woman again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is approximately 104,000 words &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;: all the romance you're looking for with an HEA/HFN. It's a promise!&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>What happens when a snarky hitman and a by-the-book PI cross paths?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leland&lt;br /&gt;Being a hitman has its perks, but I never thought getting an accidental mooning by an attractive PI while he’s caught on a fence would be one of them. While it’s not exactly love at first sight, he’s captured my interest and won’t let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I find myself caught in a game of cat and mouse, determined to attract the attention of Jackson, the PI who should be my enemy. He pretends like he’s not flattered by my flowers and the mentions of my totally-not-fictitious blow-up doll Randy (or was it Dandy?), but I know better. Why else would he be teaming up with me to bring down Hardek, one of the city’s most ruthless criminals? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson&lt;br /&gt;Even though the cops are telling me that the hitman is a notorious contract killer, I can’t help but admit that I’m drawn to him. He’s funny, charismatic, and attractive. There’s no way this ridiculous man can be the person the cops are after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Leland ends up at my doorstep injured, I’m faced with a tough choice. It’s my duty to hand him over to law enforcement, but my heart has other plans. I want to keep him. To protect him. To be with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though one question remains: why in the world does the man have so many d*mn guns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains: shenanigans on a swing that you would NOT find at a playground, a car chase that sadly doesn't have flips or explosions, a horsey ride sans horse, cuddles, an exuberant mutt, a suspicious chief of police, and lots and lots of laughs.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book one of NOLA Knights, the heart-stoppingly sexy spinoff series by Men of Haven author Rhenna Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;His world. His rules. Her love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though his methods may be rough, when it comes to protecting what’s his, Russian vor Sergei Petrovyh’s heart is always in the right place. That’s never been more true than when the gorgeous Evette Labadie asks him for a job. He knows enough to keep his hands off someone as beloved by the locals as Evie, but there’s something about her that calls to him—no matter how badly he burns to make her his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t think Evie hasn’t noticed the powerful Russian mafia boss who makes her favorite diner a regular stop. How can she not? He’s as hot as his reputation is dangerous. But everyone in her struggling New Orleans neighborhood knows he’s the man to turn to. And right now she needs money to get her son out of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her other needs—needs she knows damn well Sergei can more than satisfy—will have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie soon finds herself playing Cinderella to a man who, despite what people believe, is definitely more prince than villain. She can’t help falling deeper in love with each passing day. But when a turf war between Sergei and a rival brings violence to her doorstep, Evie must come to grips with loving a man who will do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to defend her…or walk away from her best chance at a happily-ever-after of her very own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 88,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt; I left here a man but came back a beast&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHANCE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shoulder-fired missile broke my body.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But betrayal obliterated my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months I lingered in and out of hell until my body healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m back in town with my club brothers. They think I am ok. But I am still fighting a war of darkness in my head and I can’t see a way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she comes into town like a summer breeze and makes me feel things I didn’t know existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has the voice of an angel and the body of a goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she is running from her own demons. From the Devil himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's coming to town and she's scared. But I've walked through hell and survived, and I'll walk through it again to protect her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CASSIDY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent years running from my past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Town to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;State to state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never putting down roots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am running from the Devil himself and if he finds me he will drag me down to hell again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I meet a beautiful, scarred beast of man who makes me feel something for the first time of my life...hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He makes me want to stay but thats an impossibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Devil is coming for me and when he arrives I won't stand a chance.</description>

  <description>When Charlie Sutton’s neighbour Greg is notified by the Queensland government that they intend to run a pipeline through his property, Charlie vows to help him fight it. Then Travis remembers seeing butterflies at the creek near their joining fence line - the same butterflies they couldn’t find in any Australian butterfly book. Hopeful this might be their only chance to stop the development, they seek the help of a specialist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lawson Brighton-Gale receives an email request to identify a butterfly in the Outback, only to discover it’s not an Australian butterfly at all. But that’s not all he discovers. The name on the request is familiar to Jack. An old friend from his university days, who also happened to be his old friend with benefits, Charlie Sutton. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Years ago, two out-of-towners met at the University of Sydney. Both studying environmental sciences, both hundreds of miles from home, and both finding their worlds open to new experiences, they fell into bed together. Meeting again after all this time, in front of Lawson and Travis, won’t be awkward at all, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lawson and Jack’s trip to Sutton Station certainly doesn’t go to plan, and what they take back to Tasmania isn’t just butterflies, but a cocoon of possibilities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Red Dirt Heart and Imago crossover ~ The story of when red dirt and butterflies collide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*18,000 words</description>

  <description>Jack Brighton and Lawson Gale have been together for six months and are very much in love. Lawson’s work ensuring the survival of the Tillman Copper is as demanding as ever, and Jack’s work with the regeneration of the bushfire-ravaged national park is just as hectic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jack suggests they take a short trip, Lawson agrees. But then he is offered a two-week research position in tropical Queensland to help determine why the Ulysses butterfly is on the decline. Figuring they could combine work and pleasure, Jack and Lawson go on their first vacation together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working alongside renowned professor Piers Bonfils isn’t easy. But personal and professional differences aside, Lawson is offered a more permanent role in Queensland. Torn between his new life in Tasmania with Jack and a dying species of butterfly he feels compelled to save, Lawson has to decide where his fate lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate changes the rules. On a research expedition into the depths of the rainforest, suddenly it's not only the butterflies’ existence that hangs in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A butterfly’s life cycle never changes. From larvae to imago, their course is plotted by design. Jack and Lawson need to determine where they stand, if they live through it. Because the only thing more incredible than one imago is two.</description>

  <description>Small town, small-minded people, small expectations, and big A-holes.&lt;br /&gt;Lilith Deville is the new enigma at Lakeside Preparatory Academy, a prestigious high school by a river and not a lake, which makes sense, not. Already she hates it despite its beautiful landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between riding her dirt bike through the sacred lands of the natives, plotting against those she meets, and holding greasy truckers at gunpoint, Lilith makes no time for love or friendship. Forever the walking mystery (read misery) of her new home and school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until Nokosi Locklear catches her eye with his arrogance and a hard, toned body that she’s certain she doesn’t want to climb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoved up against a locker by him in her first week, she sets him in her wicked sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is only fun when you have somebody else’s pain to focus on. So long as you stay detached. Something Lilith will find is impossible to do when it comes to Nokosi. A guy with looks but no charm. Strength but no power. Love but no morals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a serial killer roaming the States, taking victims one by one, a past in Nokosi’s eyes that he tries to hide, and a mother that would rather work than keep her daughters happy, Lilith finds plenty of time to spare and plenty of things to keep herself occupied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is your only trigger warning. Read at your own risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Verona Bay, a small coastal town where the secrets just won’t stay buried—and people aren’t always who they seem.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She was the one that got away…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years ago Serenity Washington watched as her twin sister was murdered. She was lucky to escape the same grisly fate. With her sister’s killer in jail, she relocated and tried to move on with her life. She married a man in the Air Force and started a family, but when her husband dies unexpectedly she moves back to the last place she remembers being happy—Verona Bay, FL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now that she’s come home, it’s all starting again…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within months of Serenity’s homecoming, she receives a ‘gift’—a bracelet from her sister that was never recovered after her death—and a taunting note. Terrified for herself and her young daughter, she turns to the local sheriff for help. But there’s only so much they can do without proof that the gifts aren’t more than sick pranks. There’s been no DNA, no fingerprints left behind—nothing to indicate who’s leaving them. As the horrifying gifts arrive with increasing frequency, Serenity has no doubt that she’s the ultimate target. But with her sister’s murderer—a confessed serial killer—still behind bars, she has no idea who’s stalking her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She turns to the one man she’s been trying to keep her distance from…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Marine Lucas Jordan has been hung up on single mom Serenity since she moved back to Verona Bay, but she’s made it clear she’s not looking for a relationship. When she’s targeted, however, all bets are off. He won’t sit by while she’s terrorized, and with her and her daughter’s lives in danger he’s prepared to stand his ground and protect them both. Together they face the impossible task of trying to figure out who to trust before they all wind up six feet under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST IN SERIES.</description>

  <description>DeLuca Duet, Part Two &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Mob is the same as it has always been—violent, greedy, and excessive. The Outfit families have turned their backs when they were needed the most one too many times, but Dino DeLuca didn’t expect anything different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His whole life has been lived for the Outfit—for his family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He has a whole new set of reasons to live and fight now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karen Martin makes Dino change all the rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s finally ready to show everyone just how much waste is truly worth in the mafia, and just how far one will go for freedom from it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s learned these lessons well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: The DeLuca Duet is a standalone duet with a HEA ending that can be read independently.</description>

  <description>Abel LeBlanc, better known to his brothers as Riggs — President for The Kings of Retribution MC, Louisiana Chapter. As a former Green Beret, he runs the club with the same amount of precision and grit he did serving his country. &lt;br /&gt;Dedicating years of his life to mercenary missions, and to his club left no time or desire to settle down and start a family of his own. What good could come of loving a woman if he could never promise her forever when he willingly puts his life on the line every day. &lt;br /&gt;No one has ever come close to making him want more. No one until Luna. &lt;br /&gt;A call from Jake; President and founder of The Kings of Retribution has Riggs and his men on the road toward Montana. Their objective — protect a woman from falling into the hands of another MC. &lt;br /&gt;Little did he know when his eyes fell upon the striking woman with violet eyes, she would alter his life forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up in the system is hard enough for any kid. For Luna Novak, not being able to hear the world around her made surviving in it the most terrifying and isolating experience of her life. &lt;br /&gt;Though she doesn't have much, Luna feels she has finally gotten to a point in her life where her future doesn’t look so grim. That is until she makes the mistake of putting her trust in the hands of the wrong man — almost costing Luna her life. &lt;br /&gt;For Luna to protect herself and survive, she must leave Arizona behind for a new life in Polson. When her past follows her, threatening the lives of those around her, Luna soon finds herself under the protection of the local MC. &lt;br /&gt;Leaving with Riggs and going back to Louisiana with him becomes her only choice. Her heart tells her Riggs will keep her safe, yet fear screams for her to run. &lt;br /&gt;The pull she feels toward Riggs is stronger than any feeling she has felt before, but can she put her trust and her life in the hands of another man so quickly?</description>

      <![CDATA[Where do I start?<br /><br />I finished this book and I gave 3* which is I feel more than generous. Despite the fact that it’s not well written (to the point where it drove me nearly crazy at times). The plot has holes and it’s predictable.

  <description>Nicole DaSilva keeps her mind on the future. That’s where her perfect life is. At least it will be if she can sort out her broken engagement, get her tattoo removed, control her wayward sisters and catch the person stealing from their business…but that’s easier said than done. Especially when there’s a huge, strangely attractive tattooist in her way... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Newcomb keeps his mind on the past. It’s where the demons come loose. He trusts no one and his only plans are for a vasectomy. He and Nicole make as much sense together as, well, an ex-con and a former school captain, but he's never been one to turn down a rebound thing. Especially not with a girl as Type A hot as her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's your standard ‘say anything to my sisters and I'll call the Australian Tax Office and tell them there's $500,000 in cash under your bed' affair, but as Nicole and Noah hook up it's clear they’re falling for each other. Can they meet in the present? Do they have a shot at something steady?</description>

When he approaches the beautiful woman, she captivates him with her shyness and wit, making him crave her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a pull so strong it’s impossible to ignore, December knows there’s something between her and Gareth. She just hopes they’re capable of jumping the hurdles ahead of them. &lt;br /&gt;Two boys, an ex, a surprise that will change everything, and a disgruntled co-worker, guarantee these two will have their work cut out for them if they are going to find their happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Five years after their wedding, and life is good for Renzo and Lucia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not a little stressful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re always on the move—Lucia with her gallery, and Renzo being an assassin for The League. At the chance to slow life down with a week-long trip for just the two of them to Bali, they can’t pass it up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even Bali will change things … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s one more step toward forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever is a companion to the Renzo + Lucia series. It is not written as a standalone to the series and shouldn’t be read as such.</description>

  <description>How much is too much? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Five years—that was the deal. Renzo Zulla gave up five years of his life to repay a debt to an organization that only wanted to break him before they could make him. Their way, their rules. He doesn’t move without their okay, even if his latest job puts him right in front of her. But the five years are almost up, and he knows exactly where he’s going first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love doesn’t follow rules … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken and alone—that’s how she survives. Lucia Marcello is alive, but a part of her still feels dead without him. She’s spent far too much time running away from her past and the pain she constantly holds tight because it’s easier than hating the people who caused it. But life has a way of bringing you back when your heart never will. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love doesn’t fade … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But time means nothing, and forever might be only an illusion for them. Because where fate doesn’t step in, reality does. If hate is a game you play with your heart, and contempt is the game you play with your mind … where does that leave love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vendettas don’t care about love. &lt;br /&gt;It’s in God’s hands now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: Contempt is the final book in a three-book Trilogy following the same couple.</description>

  <description>HEAT ღ HUMOR ღ HEA &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikolas “Bubba” Davies is president of the Reapers Motorcycle Club in Conroe. He doesn’t believe in running from his problems or falling hard for women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are exceptions to every rule. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calypso “Soso” Rutgers loves every damn thing about her life in Hickory Creek Township. Nothing will ever make her leave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again, with those pesky exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With trouble brewing back in Conroe, Bubba will need to man-up to save his club, his family, and the woman willing to give up everything for love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast As You contains graphic sexual content, violent situations, drug use, and harsh language. The book is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. Trigger warning: violence against women.</description>

  <description>Lucia Marcello is the good girl—or she used to be. The youngest mafia principessa of her family, she's not the one who falls for the man from the wrong side of the tracks, and she certainly shouldn't have run across the country with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She'll leave everything behind for him … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Renzo Zulla is the bad guy—society and life labeled him that way. The only person left to take care of his siblings, he couldn't afford the distraction of falling in love with a rich girl far beyond his league, and he definitely shouldn't have her riding shotgun as he runs for his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He doesn't want her anywhere else … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love keeps them together. &lt;br /&gt;Fear keeps them running. &lt;br /&gt;Chaos follows them everywhere they go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How long can they keep moving before someone finally catches up? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cost of love is always high. &lt;br /&gt;Never harbor it blindly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: Harbor is book two in a three-book trilogy following the same couple.</description>

  <description>They didn’t come from the same world … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born rich to a family of mafia royalty, Lucia Marcello was already destined to succeed. She wanted for absolutely nothing, until she met him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born poor to parents who never cared, Renzo Zulla was already destined to fail. He has struggled for absolutely everything, but she’ll prove to be his biggest fight yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s high society from the upscale suburbs. &lt;br /&gt;He’s a drug dealer from New York’s slums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They just weren’t meant to be … until they were. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What would it take to change a life—an entire perspective? All the things you thought you knew and wanted? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For them, it took thirty-six days. &lt;br /&gt;And the privilege of meeting each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They shouldn’t be. &lt;br /&gt;They don’t fit. &lt;br /&gt;Love doesn’t care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: Privilege is book one in a three-book trilogy following the same couple.</description>

  <description>What happens when your captor becomes your savior?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mikayla Miller wakes up one morning, bound to a bed, in a farmhouse in Alberta, Canada, with no recollection of how she got there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she comes face to face with her captor, Mikayla can’t deny the instant chemistry between them. The man she only knows as Nolan insists he’s her protector, but lives by his own unique moral compass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the days turn into months, Nolan’s touch, his words, and the way he looks at her, ignite her body and soul. No matter how hard Mikayla fights their unmistakable connection they share, she begins to fall for him, and a new woman is created in her place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Back in the small town where Mikayla disappeared, two women reel from a shattering loss. When letters suddenly start appearing from Mikayla, twelve years later, they are left wondering why she’d choose her abductor over her own family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is complicated, and messy; &lt;br /&gt;but sometimes the heart can’t help what it wants.&lt;br /&gt;For Mikayla Miller, it never was a choice.&lt;br /&gt;.</description>

  <description>When I stumbled into a mafia run club seeking a job, I was looking for protection. Little did I know I’d need protection from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conor O’ Callahan was exactly the kind of danger I was trying to avoid. He was gorgeous as sin with an accent hotter than Hades, but that’s where the charm ended. &lt;br /&gt;He was also cynical, cold, and downright cranky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you could imagine my surprise when he gave me a proposition. Marry him or lose my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate times call for desperate measures. I’ve learned to do what’s necessary to survive in this world, and I guess that includes marrying a mobster. Regardless of what he might say, it’s only temporary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’m going to sleep with him. Or fall for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that would be stupid, right?</description>

  <description>Follow the journey of a strong, independent, yet caring woman as she navigates the supernatural world she is thrust into. Gwen steps out of a dysfunctional family life and into a world filled with danger she never realized lives at every turn, fiery passion, and a love that is ever binding. How will she handle her strange new surroundings as well as the man with the intense and overbearing personality who threatens to destroy the emotional barriers around her heart?&lt;br /&gt;Wicked, the next in line to become the vampire king, is caught off guard when he grudgingly agrees to take on a charge, something he never wanted to do. He is unsure how to handle the fierce and vibrant woman with the unsettling green eyes. It doesn't take long for them to clash, but will it end passionately or burn down around them?</description>

  <description> From USA Today bestselling author A. Zavarelli comes an enemies to lovers romance full of blackmail, emotional twists, and explosive chemistry.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the shadows, I’ve tracked her every move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was just supposed to watch her. But now, I can’t stop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s my obsession. &lt;i&gt;My addiction.&lt;/i&gt; My poison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watching her isn’t enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The savage in me won’t be satisfied until I take her and make her mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One taste and I’m hooked. Too bad for her… &lt;i&gt;I’m never letting her go.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stalked. Hunted. Captured.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He took me from my life and locked me away in his compound. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ex-con. The big bad biker. Inked, bearded, and inhumanely sized. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And yet, every time he looks at me, I melt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This broken beast hides demons behind those brutal eyes. I hate him… and I crave him. His touch, his words, his lips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my enemies come for me, he vows to protect me as long as I do what he says. I’ll be secure in this prison he created for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But who will protect me from him?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Convict is a full length standalone within the Sin City Series and has a complete ending.</description>

  <description>Lee, Jones, and Ginger deal with dangerous situations and mounting stress daily working for the most powerful assassin organization in the world. All of those things seem like a walk in the park compared to the friction that sparks between them. When all three are assigned to the same job, ignoring the heat from the inferno of desire becomes impossible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lee is a master at deciphering codes, skilled in hacking complicated systems, and never misses a target, even from over fifty miles away. His feelings for Jones and Ginger, however, may be the first code he’s unable to crack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jones deals in absolutes, but the road to his past is paved with bodies and regrets. Getting Lee to acknowledge the pull they both feel toward Ginger may be the hardest mission he’s ever had to face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ginger struggles to cope with the overwhelming guilt that accompanies this new job. Falling for these hired killers will be a risk—one that could wind up with him losing in the end or gaining everything he’s ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the three work together to take down a human trafficking ring—and save a desperate soul—time is of the essence. Their lives are on the line as mysteries unfold and unexpected encounters throw them off course. Will Lee, Jones, and Ginger let doubts come between them, distracting them from their mission and blocking any hope of love? Or can they face the toughest challenge of their lives and become…a triple threat? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Alexander and I am an Elite Assassin for an organization called The Guard. I was taken, trained and conditioned to be everything that they needed from me and as a reward I received a Gift. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Allyanna and I am that Gift. I was taken from my family and used by The Guard to keep Alexander in line, I am their insurance, their leash, and their whipping girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***DISCLAIMER*** This is NOT a completely fluffy story. Although it contains some humor and sweetness, it also has dark elements that might make some uncomfortable. It also contains elements of dominance, obsession, discipline and dubious consent. There’s also some blood and violence doled out. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you.</description>

  <description>**READERS&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE #3, If you pre-ordered, or bought on 1/18/19, you might have received a bad (old, pre-editing) file. Amazon has agreed to push the correct files to the people who got the bad one. Just go to your Manage Content &amp;amp; Devices to upload the correct file. THANK YOU. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You're not the same as you were before…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what happens when a man has been to hell and back--literally--as Georg Kivistö, former bruin king, knows all too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Restless. Aimless. Georg is at loose ends until he encounters a strange woman in a strange land. Sweet, alluring and innocent, Alice soon wraps him around her little finger, one maddening knot at a time. Georg knows better than anyone he can't afford another romantic entanglement, but what a bruin wants a bruin gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or dies trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shadows close in, the path to a new throne seems inevitable, but is it a crown Georg really needs--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or a queen?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When shall we meet again &lt;br /&gt;In thunder, lightning, or in rain?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carly Gosse is a witch with a problem. Several of them. Her sisters treat her like a porcelain doll, her mother is keeping all kinds of secrets, and oh yeah, her boyfriend is a monster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Styx also has a problem, a red-headed one that comes with freckles. He knows he should leave, but he can't abandon the little witch that has stolen his heart. Especially when Carly announces her intention to head to Asgaard to drop off something for her crazy mother. He has to follow her to the Old World, if only to watch her cute little backside. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in this world of fairy-tale creatures, nothing is as it seems. The Gosse sisters know their mother likes her secrets, but they've never found out exactly why. When it all comes out at last, will any of them survive the fallout? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially when Carly realizes that Styx has his own secret. One that could rip them apart for all eternity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three out of four happily-ever-afters isn't bad... &lt;br /&gt;Unless you're the fourth.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fair is foul and foul is fair. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Betrayed by her father. &lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by her mother. &lt;br /&gt;Left at the altar by the prince of her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anastasia Gosse's past is more tangled than most. Everything she's been through has taught this witch one valuable lesson. &lt;i&gt;Trust no one.&lt;/i&gt; All that Ana's ever wanted was to have her family back together and safe. She'd do anything to make that happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even blackmail an assassin of the realm who drives her crazy in more ways than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tyr Kanerva thinks he's seen it all, the worst of both the human and fairytale worlds. This assassin thinks he's too jaded for surprises. Enter one clever, calculating witch who tricks Tyr into a contract that just might be the death of him. He should hate her, but instead he finds himself wondering what the witch is hiding under all that ice? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Ana comes up with a sinful solution to satisfy their mutual curiosity, neither of them are prepared for where their liaison will led. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because the FTC world is not a kind one, and between gods, goddesses and a Fire Prince who will stop at nothing to have Ana back at his side, a happily ever after for these two may be just another impossible fairytale.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not easy being a witch. Especially when you're the youngest and least talented of four sisters. But Persephone Gosse manages the same way she manages her Duluth bar, Toil &amp;amp; Trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With hard work, a smart mouth—and a lot of whiskey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seph likes her quiet life...as quiet as it can be when the king of the bears wants her as his queen, a werewolf (or three) wants her dead, and her cold-as-ice ex, Jack Frost, wants...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, she hasn't quite figured that out yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with a bounty on her head and time running out on a half-forgotten prophecy, Seph better get a clue before this witch's brew blows up in her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book is the first of a 3-book serial*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Never kiss the devil. Not even if he’s sinfully gorgeous. Or impossible to resist.&lt;br /&gt;And certainly not when he’s got you tied and bound, and completely at his mercy.&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;i&gt;Uh oh&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; I had it bad when I was on my way to be married off to some weasley little lord to appease my family. But that’s before I’m &lt;i&gt;taken&lt;/i&gt; by the most fearsome, vicious, alpha Viking to sail the seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tor Odinson is a &lt;i&gt;beast&lt;/i&gt; of a man. A savage. A bloodthirsty warrior and ravager. Huge, growly, dominant…and completely and utterly beautiful. I’m supposed to fear him, not &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; him. I’m supposed to resist him, not &lt;i&gt;crave&lt;/i&gt; him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…Yeah, &lt;i&gt;whoops&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because once he throws me over his shoulder, and lays his hands on me, and ties me to bed, and makes me feel things I’ve never even dreamed of, I know “what I’m supposed to do” is the last thing I’ll be doing when it comes to Tor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it’s wrong to desire a man like him. But if this is a sin, I’m already damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the devil, and now, I want it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Completely over the top, growly af, tropes for DAYS, and wildly historically inaccurate. As in, if you’re a history major, I’m so, so sorry. Warning: not responsible for lost or ripped bodices. Reader beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this one is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Total control. I need it in every aspect of my life. Some would say that makes me an asshole. A freak. But as long as everything’s exactly how I want it, I’m completely flexible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay, I’m not kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lacey needs someone in her life who’s bigger and scarier than her demons, and she wants that man to be me. Her boss. The Viking in a suit.I hope she understands what she’s getting into. This daddy isn’t going to pat her on the head and tell her she’s a good girl for nothing. Especially not when she’s spinning out of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author's note: this book includes depictions of eating disorder recovery.</description>

  <description>I was born a monster. Cruelty ran in my veins like poison. It ran in the veins of every Vitiello man, passed on from father to son, an endless spiral of monstrosity. A born monster shaped into an even worse monster by my father’s blade and fists and harsh words. I was raised to become Capo, to rule without mercy, to dish out brutality without a second thought.Raised to break others. When Aria was given to me in marriage, everyone waited with baited breath to see how fast I’d break her like my father broke his women. How I’d crush her innocence and kindness with the force of my cruelty.Breaking her would have taken little effort. It came naturally to me.I was gladly the monster everyone feared. Until her.Author's note: Bound By Honor in Luca's POV.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover the next major &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;“health revolution” (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) with this cutting-edge new program from &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The FastDiet&lt;/i&gt; that will help you lose weight, beat disease, and live longer with intermittent fasting. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of people worldwide have lost weight and reversed disease using Dr. Mosley’s &lt;i&gt;The FastDiet&lt;/i&gt;, which revealed the incredible power of intermittent fasting. Clinical studies show that fasting not only helps you lose weight fast, but also improves blood sugar levels and heart health, boosts brain health and function, and is even proven to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Drawing on the latest research and his personal experience gaining and then losing 14 pounds, “the world’s top gut health guru” (Dr. Barry Marshall, winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine) returns with an even more effective—yet &lt;i&gt;easier &lt;/i&gt;to follow—diet plan designed to reap maximum fasting benefits. &lt;i&gt;The Fast800 Diet &lt;/i&gt;pinpoints the ideal fasting calorie count for health and weight loss: 800. Built around a more manageable 800-calorie fasting day—whether that’s 800 calories every day until you achieve your goals, or 800 calories twice a week—Dr. Mosley’s powerful three-phase program is designed to supercharge weight loss and fast-track a healthier life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *Phase 1: a powerful jumpstart designed to accelerate weight loss.&lt;br /&gt; *Phase 2: fast twice a week to sheds pounds without slowing your metabolism.&lt;br /&gt; *Phase 3: discover how to keep the weight off—without calorie counting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Complete with over fifty-five delicious recipes, four weeks of meal plans, and inspiring success stories, &lt;i&gt;The Fast800&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Diet&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and life-changing program that gets you real-world results.</description>

  <description>The vampires have always feared the first of their kind and his descendants. Now all immortals know there’s a new Eirikrson threatening their way of life. &lt;br /&gt;And they don’t intend to let her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Catherine Stormhale has spent decades trying to crawl out of her family’s shadow. Now they’re calling her back home, to serve their clan against her new friends, and she has a choice to make. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bash used to know who he was. A protector. A provider. A huntsman. &lt;br /&gt;After being bitten by a feral vampire and turned into a blood-craving thing, he’s lost everything. Family, purpose, honor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When students are attacked outside of the Institute, all warriors are called to help secure their borders. &lt;br /&gt;Bash and Cat sign up for the same schedule. He’s a newborn vampire with no control over his thirst and she, a princess born to this life. &lt;br /&gt;Neither knows what they’re in for.</description>

  <description>They’ve exterminated an entire bloodline, purging the world of the only creatures vampires dread. Or so they think. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chloe used to study hard, do everything right to pave a bright future, but children sometimes have to pay for their parents’ sins, and Chloe’s tab is pretty steep. &lt;br /&gt;At twenty-six, when a series of attacks forces her to seek refuge in the notorious Institute of Paranormal Studies, Chloe sees it as a second chance to achieve her goals. She believes she has nothing to lose. &lt;br /&gt;She couldn’t be more mistaken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Levi has had centuries to observe the mortals and immortals of this world. He knows what the sassy woman who entered his domain is at first glance. A relic of the old days, so ancient that even an elder lord descended from the first immortals has reason to fear her. &lt;br /&gt;He should slit her throat while he has the chance. &lt;br /&gt;He &lt;i&gt;should.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;After Darkness Falls is a series of &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; paranormal romance novels.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>She needs his help…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to years of government training, Evie Bishop knows how to get into places she doesn’t belong—and she’s very good at it. But years of doing black ops work burned her out so she returns home—to unexpected chaos. One of her brothers is in a coma and the other is in hiding, wanted for murder. Then a fellow operative from her past shows up shot and bleeding with news that an assassin is gunning for everyone involved with a past op. She’s forced to turn to the one man she knows she can trust—the man whose heart she broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it will come with a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dylan Blackwood proposed a year ago, Evie turned him down flat and walked out of his life. He’s stunned when he finds her on his doorstep covered in someone else’s blood, needing his help. He always knew there was more to her than met the eye—that Evie was never simply the pampered society princess she wanted people to believe she was. But he never expected this. If she needs help, he’ll give it. Even if he can’t forget her betrayal. Even if he isn’t sure he can trust her. But his protection will come with a price—her heart. Before they can have a chance at a future, they’ll have to work together to take down a faceless enemy who has Evie firmly in his crosshairs.</description>

  <description>Kozart Savage is the world's biggest rock star. At twenty-five, he's got it all. Money. Fame. And the adoration of fans everywhere. He thought that was enough to make him forget his past. Enough to transform his distrusting heart. Turns out that's not how it works...Then he meets a bridesmaid hiding out in a hotel bar. Probably the only girl on the planet who doesn't know who he is. But she seems to be the one girl who can give him something no one else can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College senior, Aubrey Prescott, is trying to escape humiliation. While drowning her sorrows in a hotel bar, she meets a handsome stranger. One who quickly makes her forget why she's there. One who, after an unforgettable night, disappears without a second glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what they say about things that disappear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;STANDALONE #1 in the Savage Beasts rock star series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />This for me is the perfect example of a 3* read.<br />It’s a nice easy, enjoyable book. It has likeable characters and a feel good ending.<br /><br />While as a rule I’m not a fan or rock star or sports star romances. The blurb for this intrigued me.<br /><br />Like I said it’s a nice easy read....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All he has to do is strike one match to bring all her secrets to light &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gavin: &lt;br /&gt;Only a Mountain Misfit would find opportunity in his own little brother’s motorcycle accident. &lt;br /&gt;An opportunity to finally get Sloan right where I want her. Not just for the night, but for the rest of our lives. &lt;br /&gt;She’s going to be my wife. She’s going to be the queen of the Mountain Misfits MC. &lt;br /&gt;She has everything I need to wash this blood from my hands. &lt;br /&gt;Everything I need to help save my club from my father’s appetite for destruction. &lt;br /&gt;The fact that he hates her more than he hates himself makes me want her even more. &lt;br /&gt;And now… &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to throw her on the back of my bike and give her everything she wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sloan: &lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a one night stand with a big bad biker I’ve been crushing on for months. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve already put my promising career at risk by tampering with police evidence and getting tangled up in their questionable club ethics, &lt;br /&gt;but now that I’m up here on this mountain, not just in his bed but in his world, I don’t ever want to come back down. &lt;br /&gt;I’m safe here from my life below. Safe unless someone finds out the dark secrets of my past. &lt;br /&gt;And if they do… when they do… this man who I’m falling in love with will probably be the one who ends my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never Coming Down is a 75,000 word full length motorcycle club novel with no cheating, a HEA, and a super sweet never before released epilogue, and absolutely NO cliffhanger. It features themes of violence, drugs, and lots of steam. Make sure you check out Above &amp;amp; Below to get up to speed on Gavin and Sloan’s backstory before you dive into this book!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’ll make him burn down the past and forge the future from the ashes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gavin: &lt;br /&gt;Up on the mountain I’m of club royalty. I am the legacy. &lt;br /&gt;I am the man who was sent to save the Mountain Misfits MC from my father’s need for destruction. &lt;br /&gt;But maybe I don’t want to take on this burden anymore. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I want a white picket fence and a good woman to settle down with. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I’m tired of this blood on my hands. &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I want it all. One foot on the mountain, the other down below, chasing after a woman who doesn’t see me for the man I truly am. A woman who likes my leather cut. A woman who’s smart enough to know better, but damaged enough to not care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sloan: &lt;br /&gt;When you rely on a man for everything, the only thing you are worth is your word. &lt;br /&gt;And if my word is my worth, then I am worth nothing. &lt;br /&gt;I took my ex’s money as fast as he was willing to give it to me. &lt;br /&gt;I watched him sell heroin to pay my college tuition. &lt;br /&gt;I played his games, lived in his mansion, and lied through my teeth until I put him behind bars. &lt;br /&gt;And now I have nothing. Nothing but the scars on my arm and the sneers of my colleagues. &lt;br /&gt;What’s one more bad decision when my life is made of many? Especially when that bad decision smells like leather and looks like the kind of guy who might just be worse than me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Above &amp;amp; Below is the PREQUEL novella to the Mountain Misfits MC series. It ends on a serious cliffie, but I promise the HEA is coming in book 1! Just a little teaser to let you know what you're getting yourself into. &lt;br /&gt;Please note - themes of violence, abuse, and drug use, plus motorcycle club language are featured in this novel. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Her new venture is beginning to succeed but she’s fallen in love with her Amish business partner. He loves her but his community has other plans for him. Can they find a simple way to make love work in a complex world?&lt;br /&gt;Alisha moved to Hope Springs a year ago with the goal of starting a B&amp;amp;B but life took a quick detour when she met Jacob, an attractive and devout Amish farmer. Together they started an unorthodox business venture: the growing of legalized medical cannabis to aid ill hospital patients. The company has finally started to blossom but so have Alisha’s feeling for Jacob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob has devoted his entire life to his community, always placing the concerns of others over those of himself. A forward-thinker, he overcame objections from the community to switch to the medical crop, and in Alisha he’s found not only a business partner that’s helped the community finally thrive but a glimpse of what happiness actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Alisha receives a once-in-a-lifetime business offer, and the community informs Jacob he must finally settle down and marry an Amish woman, the two realize that something must change. Can Alisha and Jacob find love's fertile soil, or will strict guidelines force them into stony ground?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossroads is the final book in the acclaimed Stranger in the Fields Amish romance series. If you like sweet tales of attraction, engaging twists and turns, and culture clashes, then you'll love M.K. Lansbury's enchanting conclusion to this romance story.</description>

  <description>She wants to succeed at business. His community needs a new way to survive. Will their unconventional start-up lead to an unconventional romance?&lt;br /&gt;Alisha moved to Hope Springs with the intention of opening a B&amp;amp;B and putting her past behind her. She very quickly met the Amish community there and became very close to them and their way of life – and even closer to Jacob, the attractive young Amish man she found beaten up in her field one night.p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both needing ways to save themselves and their communities, they’ve devised a very unorthodox – but completely legal – business idea: the growing of medicinal cannabis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bringing something from idea to actual physical product is never easy. The idea is frowned upon by some of the Amish community, and Alisha is also dealing with the ghosts of her failed business past. Can her and Jacob work together to make the venture successful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the process, will the two end up falling for each other? Will it blossom into a true romance, or be pulled away like an unwanted weed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planting Seeds is the second book in the Stranger in the Fields Amish romance series. If you like sweet tales of attraction, engaging twists and turns, and culture clashes, then you'll love M.K. Lansbury's new enchanting novella.</description>

  <description>Sometimes, when your life becomes too complex, it’s best to choose the simple life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman, Alisha, moves to rural Lancaster County to take over her late aunt’s farmhouse in the hopes of converting it into a quaint B&amp;amp;B. But when she witnesses a young, attractive Amish man, Jacob, being attacked she helps him – and in doing finds herself in a life she couldn't have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the vein of sweet Amish tales Beverly Lewis and Wanda E. Brunstetter, NEW EARTH is the first in the STRANGER IN THE FIELDS series by new writer (longtime ghost writer) M.K. Lansbury. A contemporary romance, it features a sweet story with some suspense - but most importantly a view of life can be both complex and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this book, please check out M.K.'s other series, AN ANGEL IN DISGUISE. Some reviews of the first book in that series include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ "I couldn't put it down!"&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ "Loved the book."&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ "Keeps you guessing."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first book in the STRANGER IN THE FIELDS series.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />It’s years since I last read an Amish romance. Surprisingly this is very similar story to the last one I read.<br /><br />I also have to point out that when I first downloaded this series I thought it was a dystopian read. With titles like New Earth, Planting Seeds, Harvesting and Crossroads. Wel...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dirty money. A wanted man. The deal of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crime lord A.R. Carrow made billions with his gang, The Company. The seemingly-invincible, hand-picked team ruled Southern California with outrageous heists and a flare for the dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dustin Wrenshall asked to join The Company, Carrow should have been cautious. But something about the brash young demolitions expert and his raw desire to please made Carrow ignore every alarm bell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Dust entered his life, Carrow wanted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Carrow always got what he wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Federal agent Charlie Judge knew that infiltrating The Company would be dangerous. What Charlie didn’t know was just how much he would enjoy becoming Dust Wrenshall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He steeled himself for fear. What he found was something entirely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world of The Company was nothing like Dust imagined — full, satisfying, and populated by a family of criminals that he cared for more than he thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrow and Dust crashed together in a wreck of chaos, lies, and lust that neither man could control. What they brought out in each other terrified them both, but the broken half-truths of their lives slotted together in a way that made perfect sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dust was in love with the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough justice was inevitable. But when the truth was revealed, which version of him would emerge: fearless and passionate Dust Wrenshall, or the naive federal agent who saw the world in black and white?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And more importantly, armed with the truth, &lt;i&gt;would Carrow allow either to survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The blood of my friend is on Aon’s hands, a King who would do anything to protect me. He believes his actions are justified because of a prophecy by the Ancients predicting my undoing by the hands of a friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to accept it. Nothing can justify what Aon did, what he took from me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as one threat is buried, another arises. The other Kings and Queens of Under are waking up from their crypts, and a war among us is imminent. The need for revenge and power is driving immortals to the brink of madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the other Kings and Queens of Under are blinded by their own selfish conquests, something big and more dangerous than anything we’ve ever faced is about to shake Under to its core. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s one King who seems to hold the key to it all, the answers to our fate. A white-winged angel, a legion whose mind is made of a thousand souls with magic strong enough to hold the Ancients captive at the bottom of the pool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The King of Blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to determine whether he’s an ally…or the worst enemy Under has ever seen.</description>

  <description>Savy believes she is a terrible person—murder and kidnapping hardly scream innocence. But what choice did she have? She had vowed to protect her little sister at any cost. Now, after years on the run, Savy believes they have finally escaped. But when her past crashes back into her life, she must decide if they will flee yet again, or stand and fight the Monster that has haunted their steps. Only problem? Defeating her past means trusting the sexy but dangerous outlaw biker who comes with demons of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diablo—the ruthless President of Havoc Motorcycle Club—is the devil in every sense of the word. And he definitely doesn’t have time for women, preferring the ease of club girls instead. That is until a curly-haired woman with haunted eyes stumbles into his life, awakening both his passion and a deep need to protect her. So when her life is threatened by a man from her past, he is quick to jump to her aid. He has no doubt he can save her, but can he win her heart in the process? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a contemporary romance with a dark twist. It contains sexual situations and scenes of violence. Recommended for ages 18 and over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A match made in hell?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devon and Tanner fight like... well, cats and dogs. Which makes sense since hellcats and hellhounds aren't exactly a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, their demons' antipathy towards each other is matched only by the red-hot sexual tension between Tanner and Devon. It's driving them - and their long-suffering friends Harper and Knox - mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Devon is nearly kidnapped, Tanner's protective instincts kick into overdrive - he's sticking by her side, day and night. But staying so close means their hunger can no longer be denied . . . They know their demons won't accept the match, but after one red-hot night they'll fight to stay together as long as they can, even though shadows are gathering around them. Devon's would-be kidnapper is still on the loose, a serial killer carrying rage from a twisted past threatens the lair and, most of all, Tanner and Devon are losing themselves to the heat between them. When this relationship goes up in flames, it could be a blaze that neither of them can walk away from . . .</description>

  <description>I died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be the end of my story. But after Aon buried me in the Pool of the Ancients, I learned that Under wasn’t done with me yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I escaped death the first time, there’s a prophecy predicting my demise, and it’s driving Aon mad. His desperation to protect me is dangerous, deadly, and I’m afraid of what he might do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The void that threatens to destroy this world is receding, yet Under is still not safe. I can feel it in my blood, the warning that something terrible is coming. Something bigger and stronger than all of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am no longer the human girl merely fighting for survival. I’m different now, changed into something this world hasn’t seen in fifteen hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am immortal, a queen of Under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the Queen of Dreams.</description>

  <description>No indiscriminate killing. No collateral damage. No unvetted targets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are the rules Hawes Madigan lives by. Rules that make being Fog City’s Prince of Killers bearable. Soon, he’ll be king—of an organization of assassins—and the crown has never felt heavier. Until the mysterious Dante Perry swaggers into his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dante looks like a rock god and carries himself like one too, all loose-limbed and casually confident. He also carries a concealed weapon, a private investigator’s license, and a message for the prince. Someone inside Hawes’s organization is out to kill the future king. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the chaos that follows the timely warning, Hawes comes to depend on Dante. On his skills as an investigator, on the steadiness he offers, and on their moments alone when Hawes lets Dante take control. As alliances are tested and traitors exposed, Hawes needs Dante at his back and in his bed. But if the PI ever learns Hawes’s darkest secret, Hawes is sure to get a knife to the heart—and a bullet to the brain—instead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s no shortage of twists and turns in this new romantic suspense trilogy from Layla Reyne. &lt;i&gt;Prince of Killers&lt;/i&gt; is book one of three. Fair warning: buckle up, cliffhangers ahead!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s a story as old as time when an ancient immortal falls in love with a human. Except this time, there’s a hitch: our “hero” is a vampire and he’s fallen in love with a vegan. Let us count all the ways this could go wrong… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin our tale in Napa, California. Land of sun, wine and relaxation. The perfect setting for our romantic disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Nod is elegance and control personified. He may be the bearer of a biblical curse and a monster but he refuses to act like one. Sebastian finds himself tempted in fresh and torturous ways after he agrees to help a gorgeous young chef but he’s determined to guard his heart. He’s been around long enough to have learned that a romance between a vampire and a human can only end in heartbreak. All Sebastian has to do is pretend that he’s a vegan and keep his hands and lips off his new personal chef. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that brings us to Jasper Abel. Bright, young and talented, he’s fled an abusive boyfriend in L.A. for a dream job in Napa. Unfortunately, things go wrong as soon as he arrives and Jasper is forced to accept help from the beguiling and mysterious Mr. Nod. Jasper is determined to be the master of his own fate, but fate has a very wicked sense of humor. He quickly realizes that something is very off about Sebastian Nod, but Jasper can’t help himself, the man is as deliciously tempting as he is befuddling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a dangerous and intoxicating concoction of coconut water, yoga, vegetable-based deception, a cruel curse and just a sprinkle of capricious fate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is a "happy for now" romance. Crave is the first book in the Curse of Cain series and just the beginning of Sebastian and Jasper's love story.*</description>

  <description>Happy Birthday, Daniel. I was told not to send you another text, but I never was any good at listening. I love and miss you. I always will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I lost my partner of eight years, I felt like my world was crashing down around me. In order to feel some relief from the overwhelming emptiness, I’ve found myself sending him texts every year on his birthday, even though I know he will never answer. It makes me feel like there’s a piece of him still alive, at least in my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m sorry, you must have the wrong number. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until someone responds to my text. Jace is charming, sweet, and everything I could ever want. But how can I accept someone new in my life when Daniel’s only been gone two years? Even so, Jace starts to consume my world. It feels like I can finally breathe as he helps me understand that my life doesn’t have to revolve around my grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, I find myself laughing again as he pulls me away from the hopeless cycle I’ve been caught in, and I love spending time with him, whether it’s playing video games together or discussing our comic book alter egos. But I still need to let go of this guilt and allow Jace to show me that I can love another without replacing what I’ve lost. Jace rewrites my entire world with every word and smile he gives me, and it’s becoming harder to not give in and hand him my heart. Maybe Daniel did respond after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Last Text is a 37k word novella about overcoming loss, finding hope, and friendship that leads to new love.</description>

  <description>Someone is trying to kill Marc Foster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempted poisoning was bad enough, but when the would-be killer messes with the brakes on Marc’s precious Porsche, the art dealer admits he needs help. He just wasn’t expecting help to be quite so dark and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royce Karras loves his job at Ward Security. He’s making up for a lifetime of bad decisions and a bloody past he’d rather forget. But Marc isn’t the spoiled rich boy he thought he’d be protecting. Sticking close to Marc as his “boyfriend” gives Royce insight into his toxic family, but it also reveals a brilliant, compassionate man who completely disarms Royce. Against his better judgment, Royce finds himself falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can they find a way to make it work when Royce’s past threatens to tear their lives apart? Their futures hinges on a lost Renaissance painting, six Bichon Frises, and a pornographic Robin Hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries, right?</description>

  <description>When private investigator, Shane Stephens, is hired by the mayor of Cincinnati to track down the hacker who has been threatening him, Shane is sure this is the opportunity to launch the Merleau Detection Agency into the big time. He even convinces Rowe Ward of Ward Security to loan him one of his best IT specialists, Quinn Lake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shane, a man who prefers casual intimacy, is surprised by his attraction to the moody computer geek, but when Quinn suggests they have fun for the month he’s on loan, Shane happily agrees. Both men are expecting nothing more than a good time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the investigation takes an unexpected turn and they quickly discover they are facing more than a hacker out to ruin the mayor’s re-election chances. And as they spend more time together, they realize their relationship may be a lot more than just a good time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With only weeks until the election, Shane and Quinn race to gather the proof they need while dodging bullets and possibly…falling in love.</description>

  <description>After weeks aboard a battleship, as little more than a captive and a pirate captain’s entertainment, Rain is back where she should be living, with a man she should be loving, in a life that should be freeing. So why doesn’t it feel that way? Everything once right, now feels so wrong.How can a woman who has been through so much crave the source of her hurt? Is it psychological damage? Or did the sea seduce her as intensely as the captain that sailed it?</description>

  <description>Kidnapped from her doorstep in return for information, Rain finds herself miles from home in the middle of the ocean, on a pirate ship full of criminals and ex-cons. &lt;br /&gt;Escaping with her life is the least of her worries when the captain insists she stay in his room, in his bed, by his side, always. &lt;br /&gt;He’s her captor, but with sweet gestures come blurred lines. And hatred, a passionate emotion, can morph into things not to be said aloud or even thought. &lt;br /&gt;The captain is a bad man, and unfortunately for Rain, he wants her to be bad too. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Papa says everyone has a story that deserves to be told. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most begin years ago, after the second bomb hit, unearthing a deadly contagion that divided the population into the pure, the infected, and the Ragers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many recount the moment we rose up from the ashes and started anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others tell of the day we built a wall to keep them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some, they’re nothing more than the vestiges left behind—a simple name carved into the knotty bark of a Juniper tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story begins with a boy. A mute, from the other side of the wall, known only as Six, who touched my heart in ways that words never could, and gave me the courage to face my darkest truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This book contains explicit sexual content, and violent scenes that some readers may find disturbing.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love a good dystopian and this book is fabulous. I will warn you it’s not an easy read. At times I was well outside my comfort zone. But it was worth it. This book hooked me early on and just never let go. My only real cause for concern was the eight year jump in time. I’m not a fan of losing y...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Never promise a life that isn’t yours to give.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York City is decked out for the holidays, and Special Agent Patrick Collins is looking forward to a reunion with his old team when he gets assigned a new case. A human child is missing, and the changeling left in her place causes a prominent witch family to demand justice from the fae. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, continued harassment from the New York City god pack forces Jonothon de Vere to formally establish his own with Patrick. Doing so will mean a civil war within the werecreature community—a war they risk losing from the start without alliances. Making bargains with the fae is never wise, but Patrick and Jono have nothing to lose when a fae lord comes asking for their help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Summer Lady has been kidnapped from the Seelie Court, and if they can find her, Patrick and Jono will cement an alliance with the fae. But the clues to her disappearance are found in Tír na nÓg, and the Otherworld has never been kind to mortals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Venturing past the veil, Patrick and Jono risk losing territory, time, and their very lives while searching for answers. Because the Queen of Air and Darkness knows they are coming—and the ruler of the Unseelie Court has an offer for them they can’t possibly refuse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Crown of Iron &amp;amp; Silver&lt;/i&gt; is a 107k word m/m urban fantasy with a gay romantic subplot and a HFN ending. It is a direct sequel to &lt;i&gt;All Souls Near &amp;amp; Nigh&lt;/i&gt;. Reading the prior books in the series would be helpful in enjoying this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; HEAT ღ HUMOR ღ HEA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life's been trying to break Sissy Mullen since the day she was born. Though her violent father nearly ran her into the ground, she's finally free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan "Butch" Davies doesn't like people. Bailey Johansson and Nick Davies' quiet middle son is better at busting heads than making conversation. The Reapers enforcer will need to leave his comfort zone if he hopes to show Sissy that he's the man she doesn't know she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, claiming the woman he loves means pissing off his older brother and stirring up trouble between the Reapers' local chapter and Conroe's former overlords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't Do Me Wrong contains graphic sexual content, violent situations, and harsh language. The book is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling author Keri Lake comes an intense and gritty romantic thriller that'll have you turning the pages well past your bedtime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It takes a killer to catch a killer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And no one understands the motives of ruthless murderer, The Sandman, quite like Rhett Voss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having spent his childhood in the shadows of the deranged lunatic, he’s become an expert on the topic. Killing is in his blood, and as a hitman for hire, Voss maintains a steady diet of carnage, himself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except lately, it’s lost its appeal. Until he’s enticed to track down the clever Sandman who has his sights set on Nola Tensley.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stunning single mom is a distraction Voss can’t afford, but to catch his elusive kin, he needs to watch the next victim closely. Consequently, stalking her soon becomes a dangerous obsession, turning a friendly game of cat and mouse into more than he bargained for, when someone close to Nola goes missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, it’s no longer an old vendetta fueling Voss’s need to hunt down his enemy, but new stakes that are sure to mean more bloodshed. Voss knows better than anyone, though: to draw a killer out of hiding, one must have the right bait.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And both of them want Nola.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From author Katie Reus, books 4-6 (full length novels) in her Darkness series are combined into one boxed set. This collection includes:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hunted by Darkness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re from two different worlds… he wasn’t supposed to fall for her. When Bo and Nyx are thrown into a hell realm together, they must band together to survive. No matter who was behind the attack, Bo’s choice is clear. Defend Nyx at all cost and make her his forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Into the Darkness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One book. Two stories—and two happily ever afters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rhea is a warrior. She’s bled and fought for the Stavros wolf pack for over a hundred years. When her past comes back to haunt her, she finds herself working side by side with the Alpha of a dragon clan. But she’ll never risk getting someone she cares for killed. Not again. Too bad he’s playing for keeps. Conall has been biding his time claiming his future mate. But she’s determined to keep walls between them. It’s a good thing he’s a dragon. He’ll just burn down every last barrier and claim what’s his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year ago Liberty had no idea that things that go bump in the night actually existed. Saved from a Hell realm, she finds herself falling for her sexy rescuer Rory more and more every day. But she’s worried she’s too broken to ever have a relationship again. Half-wolf, half-demon Rory has been looking out for Liberty ever since rescuing her. He’s not sure what it’s going to take to move from friend to more, but he’s willing to wait forever. Because Liberty is worth fighting for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saved by Darkness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hybrid demon/dragon shifter Ian McCabe is hellbent on getting back the only woman he's ever loved. When Fiona O'Riley kicked him out of her life decades ago, he thought she was gone for good. Now she's back and nothing will stop him from claiming her. But there’s so much more on the line. As their undeniable desire intensifies, they're faced with an unbearable choice. If Fiona and Ian succumb to their temptation, mating could be the last thing they ever do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Length: 218,000 words&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author note: Each of these titles can be bought individually or part of this box set.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times and USA Today Bestselling author Katie Reus, the first three books in her Darkness series in one boxed set:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness Awakened&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Years ago he ended things between them to protect her…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As leader of one of the fiercest werewolf packs in the south, Finn Stavros is in full battle mode 24/7. He’s ready for anything—until his vampire long lost love shows up on his doorstep in desperate need of help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pregnant and kicked out of her coven, Lyra struggled to raise their rare shifter-vampire daughter Vega alone among humans. When the 16-year-old is kidnapped Lyra swallows her pride and turns to Finn. But how long can she keep him from guessing the truth about who Vega really is? As they race against the clock to save their daughter, they must defeat the threat imposed by demons infiltrating the human world and a hell gate that could destroy the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taste of Darkness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He spent more than a thousand years imprisoned in Hell…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drake is an ancient dragon shifter, one of the most powerful beings in existence, but over a millennium trapped in utter darkness has left him ill-equipped for modern society. If it wasn’t for Victoria, the sweet female brave enough to befriend him, he’d be lost. She’s smart and gorgeous and everything he never dared dream of during his years of agonizing loneliness. He may not have anything to offer her, but one thing he knows for sure: he’d die to keep her safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only to fall into the heaven of her touch.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Victoria is a wolf shifter, healer of the Stavros pack. She’s seen a lot, but she’s never met anybody quite like Drake, the fiery, fascinating shifter who can blaze through the skies unseen by mere mortals. He’s lost, dangerous, and the last male she should fall in love with, but the more time she spends helping him navigate modern life, the deeper—and hotter—their connection becomes. She’s thrilled when they finally locate his family, but reuniting with his people plunges them both into unimaginable danger. It's a race against the clock trying to figure out who wants them dead and who they can trust, especially when the threat is closer than they ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond the Darkness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now that she has her freedom, she’s not giving it up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dragon shifter Keelin Petronilla spent centuries in forced hibernation dreaming of one thing: freedom. Now she’s living life on her terms—she’s ditched her clan for an unruly wolf pack, she tends bar for a half-demon, and she’s loving it…until a powerful supernatural being targets her. She intends to handle the mysterious attacks on her own…without the help of dragon Alpha Bran Devlin. Sure, he’s sexy in that hot, scowling possessive way, but Keelin wants to live her own life in her own way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now that he’s found his mate, he’s not letting her go.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former black ops agent Bran Devlin is a born dragon Alpha and leader of a fierce clan. Getting mated was never part of his plan—until a feisty dragon princess gets under his skin in a big way. The hell of it is, she doesn’t want a mate; she just wants to have a good time. He plays along, but when a dark and powerful being marks her for death, he’s determined to stay by her side in spite of her protests. Now that he’s found his mate, he means to keep her safe no matter what the cost…even if he has to risk it all.</description>

  <description>After three years, Snow and Jude’s relationship is still passionate and strong. They’re getting ready for a romantic vacation at home when Jude receives a horrifying call no one wants to receive. His youngest brother was found barely clinging to life. While Jude’s family is rallying around Jordan, Jude is determined to find out what happened to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snow and Jude follow the clues, investigating a side of Jordan’s life none of them knew about…and is far darker than any would have believed possible. They get pulled deeper into the seedy side of life, while echoes from a past Snow thought he walked away from return to offer an unexpected insight into the cause of Jordan’s injuries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But someone else has noticed their involvement and is furious, putting them both in danger. The risk is high but so is Jude’s determination to find the truth—though the knowledge could very well fracture his heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today bestselling author Katie Reus comes the final story in the sensual, pulse-pounding Darkness series…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a bringer of death…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Awakened after millennia, dragon warrior Reaper is ready to fulfill his destiny…until he sees Greer. With one glimpse, everything Reaper has ever known throughout his very long life is irrevocably changed. Greer’s his mate, he feels it in his blood, in his soul—but convincing her is another matter. The dragon clan healer finds him obnoxious and annoying, but he knows a woman’s interest when he smells it. And Greer smells like one word: mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meets a giver of life…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greer has spent hundreds of years using her healing abilities for the good of others, making her the polar opposite of Reaper. The ferocious war general may be an ancient, but his arrogance proves he hasn’t spent any of that time learning about women. Greer is displeased when her Alpha sends her to New Orleans with the insufferable warrior—then she sees him in action against a menace threatening to tear the city apart. Fierce, protective, magnificent…mate-worthy. Except he’s hiding something from her. Something dark and devastating that could destroy their newly forged bond. Maybe opposites do attract, but if they want to live long enough to find out, they’ll first have to save the world teetering on the brink of obliteration. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Length: NOVEL &lt;br /&gt;Author note: This is the final book in the Darkness series and can be read as a stand-alone.</description>

  <description>Ian Pierce is the chef and part owner of the hottest restaurant in Cincinnati, his chosen family is full of happy relationships, and the scruffy, snarky cop who has been haunting his dreams is one step closer to being in his bed. But everything comes crashing down when the past he narrowly escaped nine years ago comes to a deadly head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollis Banner was enamored of Ian at first sight. He’s kept his distance, knowing the gorgeous, self-confident man is out of his league. Yet there’s no standing aside when Boris Jagger escapes a raid. Jagger's world has been nearly destroyed and this time, the crime boss is coming after Ian and his friends personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollis will do whatever it takes to keep Ian safe as they escape to a safe house with a couple of Ian's overprotective friends. And Ian finds himself in a race to unlock painful memories—memories containing information that could take down the very last of Jagger's illegal operations forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trigger warning: Flashbacks to abuse could be possible triggers for some.</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling author Keri Lake comes an intense and gritty romantic thriller that’ll have you turning the pages well past your bedtime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The most terrifying monsters aren’t found in dreams ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four young socialites have gone missing in the Chicago area. Two found dead, bearing the signature marks of a brutal serial killer. With the kind of tragedy that mars Nola Tensley’s past, she should be concerned, but without a pot to piss in, all the struggling single mom cares about is making a normal life for her son. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After all, she’s clearly not the murderer’s type. &lt;br /&gt;Or is she? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Rhett Voss, an enigmatic and handsome stranger, answers her ad for the outdated in-law suite at the back of her property, offering double her asking price, Nola really can’t refuse. Even though the supposed Wall Street Wolf seems better suited for a high-rise downtown—a suspicion that quickly turns into hindsight once she submits to the flirtations of her charming new tenant, and consequently, unearths a series of disturbing revelations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Her curiosities lead her down the path of a madman, whose moniker, The Sandman, only hints at the grisly nature of his crimes. He’s smart. Evasive. A cunning psychopath with a twisted method of disposing his victims. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And his hunting grounds are hitting too close to home.</description>

  <description>Some call him a madman. Others call him a warlock. Both are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it wasn’t for Aon, I’d be dead. I was mere seconds away from dying by Edu’s hands when the King of Shadows appeared in a flash of lightning, saving me from Edu’s murderous plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m under his protection, living in his home. The more time I’m forced to spend with him, the more I start to piece together the puzzle of why Aon and Edu are at war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite how everyone else seems to hate Aon, there’s something that pulls me towards him—like gravity, refusing to let go. My heart is telling me to believe what he says is true, yet there’s this prickle of warning in the back of my skull cautioning me against falling for the King of Shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world of Under trusting the wrong person can get you killed. Only the strong survive out here, and that’s what I intend to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survive.</description>

  <description>Jules is running from her old life and the man who wants to lock her up and abuse her. She’s finally escaped, but she’s run right into another mountain of trouble. She agrees to do one last job for her new boss and then she’s out. But once again she’s caught in the middle when she’s taken hostage by a hot stranger named Cooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooper is robbing from the rich to give back to his community and make the town he grew up in a safer place. He and his band of brothers are stealing every dime from the local mob, but when it’s time to grab the bag, he gets more than he bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: If being held against your will with this hot alpha is a crime, then lock me up! These two get cozy while on the run and burn up the road. Grab it now and lock it down… We promise you won’t be disappointed.</description>

  <description>Sheriff Lance Beaufort is not going to let trouble into his town, no sir. Tucked away in the California mountains, Mad Creek has secrets to keep, like the fact that half the town consists of ‘quickened’—dogs who have gained the ability to become human. Descended on both sides from Border Collies, Lance is as alert a guardian as they come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tim Weston is looking for a safe haven. After learning that his boss patented all of Tim’s work on vegetable hybrids in his own name, Tim quit his old job. A client offers him use of her cabin in Mad Creek, and Tim sees a chance for a new start. But the shy gardener has a way of fumbling and sounding like a liar around strangers, particularly gorgeous alpha men like Sheriff Beaufort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lance’s hackles are definitely raised by the lanky young stranger. He’s concerned about marijuana growers moving into Mad Creek, and he’s not satisfied with the boy’s story. Lance decides a bit of undercover work is called for. When Tim hits a beautiful black collie with his car and adopts the dog, its love at first sight for both Tim and Lance’s inner dog. Pretending to be a pet is about to get Sheriff Beaufort in very hot water. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Shelby Walsh is struggling to make ends meet. She spends her days doing singing telegrams for extra cash, but she never expected to be sent out to perform for the world’s most famous composer. And definitely not in a skimpy Greek goddess outfit. How is she supposed to keep it together when every part of her is screaming for him to take her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Hayes is a recluse. He just wants to be left alone to work on his next big movie score. He’s even grumpier than usual because he’s in a bit of a rut. But when his brother sends him a singing telegram for inspiration, he finds his muse and plans to never let her go. Keeping her for his very own is the only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: We’ve teamed up with Fiona Davenport to give you an epic symphony for your lady business. What’s better than two authors working you over? How about four? If you want insta-love with all the safety and security of a happily ever after, then jump in bed with us. There’s room for more!</description>

  <description>Everything about my life has been pretty normal working as a forensic autopsy technician. Until the day I woke up with a mysterious symbol tattooed on my arm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly normal no longer existed. The barrier between Earth and a world called Under, dissolved... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I’m trapped with dozens of other people. Held prisoner by the creators of myths and legends, where the realm is ruled by two masked kings who want to turn us into creatures like them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even though I didn’t choose to be here, this new world manages to pull me deeper, affecting me differently than other humans. Unfortunately King Edu, also known as the King of Flames, notices this and I’m now considered a threat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I want to survive King Edu and the dangers of Under, I need to escape. The only problem is, there’s another masked king who seems to have an interest in me. Aon, the King of Shadows, wants me here in this world, and he wants me alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just need to figure out why. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Simon Kim is very much in love with Leith Haas, but Leith is a Warder. His job—hunting demons—is dangerous and important, and Simon doesn’t want to distract the man he loves more than life with the small stuff. But he doesn’t quite get that when a Warder takes a Hearth, the Warder gives his heart without reservation. When Leith claimed Simon, Leith bared his soul, leaving himself vulnerable before the only man he’s certain he’ll ever love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Simon is sucked further into Leith’s perilous world—and into an alternate dimension—Simon realizes that the only strength he can give his Warder is the strength of his love. Can Simon sacrifice the control he has come to treasure for the man who already owns his soul?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; How do I reject thee? Let me count the ways… &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejected and broken-hearted, Genesis Fairchild turns to her best friends and come up with a plan to give Logan, the school’s major player, and future alpha, a taste of his own medicine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One Operation Payback later, a silver-gray eyed lycan joins in the picture and like a moth to a flame, Genesis feels the instant connection between her and the Lycan Constantine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she is introduced into the pack of lycan royalty, she not only deals with her changing identity, but also the arrogant future Alpha’s retracted rejection and determination to finally claim her, leaving her life a bit more interesting and a whole lot more complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Genesis allow her one true mate to complete the mating bond? &lt;br /&gt;Or will she follow her heart and become the erasthai that she has been long destined to be? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you want something fun and light to devour in one sitting, then get lost in Genesis’ world of arrogant werewolves, royal brats, and an irresistible lycan god. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Grab a copy now! &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Jin Church is back where he started, alone, wandering, and uncertain of his path. It’s not by choice but by circumstance, as he remembers he’s a werepanther… but not much else. He knows one thing for sure—he needs to find the beautiful blond man who haunts his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan Church is trapped in a living hell. His mate is missing, his tribe is falling apart, and he’s estranged from the son he loves with all his heart. His world is unraveling without his mate by his side, and he has no one to blame but himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Jin can regain his memory and Logan can overcome the threats to his leadership, then perhaps they can resume their lives. The question is: Is that what they want? Back to the same house, the same tribe, the same troubles? They can choose from various roads leading to their future… or they can forge their own path.</description>

  <description>In the secret city of Sobek, Domin Thorne is making his way as the newly chosen semel-aten, the leader of the werepanther world. He aspires to make sweeping changes—he’s set goals for himself and the people he chose to bring with him, modeling his reign after that of his friend, Logan Church. But Domin may have set too lofty a goal: his normal leadership style isn’t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While juggling a homesick Crane, a moody Mikhail, a bullwhip-wielding Taj, servants with murderous intentions, a visiting ex, and a mate on a dangerous goodwill mission, Domin has to figure out his new role alone. He also must determine how to deal with a conspiracy, all the while falling hard for a man who, for the first time in Domin’s life, reciprocates that love. Whether Domin is ready or not, Fate has stepped in to teach him a lesson: internal threats are just as dangerous as external ones.</description>

    &lt;em&gt;Sequel to Trusted Bond&lt;br /&gt;Change of Heart: Book Three&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jin Rayne is still growing into his frightening new powers as a nekhene cat and his place as reah of Logan Church’s tribe when he learns that a sepat, an honor challenge, has been called. Logan, who has never wanted to do anything but lead his small-town tribe, must travel around the world to Mongolia and fight to become the most powerful leader in the werepanther world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan won’t be the only one making the journey. As his mate, Jin must fight with him to honor his commitment to Logan, his culture, and his tribe. But the trial is long, involving a prolonged separation between the two men, and Logan’s humanity is at stake. In order to make it through the nightmarish sepat, Jin and Logan must accept their fates, trust each other, and honor the vows between them no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Sequel to Change of Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jin Rayne is having trouble adjusting to the new life he’s supposed to love. Instead of adapting to being the mate of tribe leader Logan Church, Jin can't get past the fact that his lover was straight before they met. He's discovered the joy in belonging to Logan but fears his new life could disappear at a moment’s notice, despite Logan's insistence that they are forever, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jin wants to trust Logan, but that desire will be put to the test both by a rival tribe leader and by a startling revelation about Jin's existence. At stake is Jin's life and his place in the tribe. If he's going to survive to see Logan again, he'll have to release his fear and freely accept the bond, for only then can he truly trust.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5*<br /><br /><br />The previous book ‘Change of Heart’ started incredibly well. But it was dragged down by inconsistencies. <br />This book started badly (for me anyway) Jin annoyed me from the get go and I was ready to call it quits. But I kept reading and it became a crazy OTT strangely addictive...]]>

  <description>Maddox &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason I rarely go home is three simple words: I’m a liar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the pressure to marry my childhood sweetheart became too much, I told her I was gay and then fled to New York like my ass was on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, five years later and after a drunken encounter, I find myself invited to her wedding. And I have to bring my boyfriend—the boyfriend who doesn’t exist because I’m straight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, I think I am. Meeting the guy I’m bribing to be my boyfriend for the weekend makes me question everything about myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damon &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my sister asks me to pretend to be some straight guy’s boyfriend, my automatic response is to say no. It’s because of guys like him people don’t believe me when I tell them I’m gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Maddox has something I need. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After an injury that cost me my baseball career, I’m trying to leave my playing days behind and focus on being the best sports agent I can be. Forty-eight hours with my sister’s best friend in exchange for a meeting with a possible client. I can do this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just wish he wasn’t so hot. Or that he didn’t kiss like he means it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wait … why is the straight guy kissing me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Fake Out is a full-length MM novel with no cliffhanger.*</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PAIGE &lt;br /&gt;People say Derek Gentry is arrogant, perpetually drunk and good for only one thing. &lt;br /&gt;Even from a distance he's like a neon sign that reads: ‘I AM THE WORST IDEA YOU EVER HAD.’ &lt;br /&gt;And I’m not tempted, no matter how hot he is. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard the rumors. I know his story. &lt;br /&gt;But I’ve got my own scars. I don’t need his. &lt;br /&gt;Despite his muscled, blue-eyed good looks, he’s definitely just heartbreak wrapped in a seductive package. &lt;br /&gt;However, I didn’t plan on falling into his arms on the worst night of my life. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t plan on initiating a chain reaction of events that neither of us saw coming. &lt;br /&gt;And I didn’t plan on needing him so much I can hardly stand it… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DEREK &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has a history. &lt;br /&gt;Mine’s a little worse than most. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve hurt my family. I’ve hurt people I never even knew. I’ve hurt myself. &lt;br /&gt;And I’ve been hiding at the bottom of a bottle for so long I’m not sure how to do things differently. &lt;br /&gt;At first Paige didn’t seem like the type who would ever be able to handle a guy like me. &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know what kind of mysteries she’s been keeping inside. &lt;br /&gt;Now I can’t get her out of my head. &lt;br /&gt;We could help each other. &lt;br /&gt;Or we could destroy each other. &lt;br /&gt;Right now it’s anyone’s guess. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Stories tell of great fire-breathing beasts large as castles, fierce and deadly, capable of magicks that no human can match. The Kingdom of Kentaine once allied itself with the dragons of old, but eventually, the dragons were lost to time and fell into legend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sir Gawain, First Knight of the Realm, is tasked by his older sister the Queen to travel to the edges fo their kingdom, where a beast is flaming villagers and has the locals ready to form a mob and hunt it down themselves. His mission is to find the dragon, stop the violence, and do what he needs to maintain the peace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His journey puts him in the heart of a confrontation with the dragon, but instead of saving the villagers, it is the dragon that needs rescuing. Zephyr, a fire dragon and an escaped slave, needs protection, time to heal, and a chance at a life full of hope. &lt;br /&gt;Gawain can do no less than offer his sword, his shield, and his heart. Evil is hunting Zephyr, and it will not stop until it has reclaimed its prize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beyond the legends lies the truth, and love, like fire, consumes everything it touches. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Please note this is a novella of 38,330 words and is not a full-length novel.**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ben wants to find a new home.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Ben McCormick is the primary caregiver for his brother Milo after their parents’ death. A year into the job, he’s totally got the hang of it. Mostly. Sort of. Not at all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Defeated and thoroughly chastised for his lack in parenting skills at teacher-parent night, Ben slumps away with the resolve to finally get his life sorted: be a better role model, and sell their parents’ house for a fresh start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But first, he needs to spruce up his house to hit the market. He’s no DIY king, but Milo’s hot-as-hell woodwork teacher is… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack wants an old home to fix.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirty-nine-year-old Jack Pecker is waiting for the home of his dreams to come on the market in the summer. What better way to wait the interim months than working on a small renovation gig? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only trouble is, the gig is for the McCormick brothers. And working in close quarters to red-haired Ben McCormick won’t be easy. Not with the attraction that simmers between them.

  <description>Dove Rosetta is crushing hard on the hot guy she ran in to at the coffee shop. His big build, sharp suits and dark eyes have her flustered, and as luck would have it, they meet by chance every day. She might be innocent, but her thoughts aren’t, and she’s ready for him to make a move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau Heart has been watching her for weeks. It’s no accident that he sees Dove every day and he’s tired of playing it cool. He’s done with gentle and patient. He’s grumpy, and now it’s time for dirty and fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This Valentine’s story is filled with alpha possessiveness and rough need. Good things come to those who wait, but great things come to those who claim. Get ready!</description>

  <description>Bee Armstrong is used to being the ugly duckling in her family. Her sister is the one who gets all the love and affection, including from her parents. She’s learned to deal with being alone, so when a strange man can’t keep his eyes off her, she’s not prepared for what she feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ragnar Black isn’t a decent man. He makes his money illegally and does whatever it takes to get what he wants. One night he’s walking home after a job and sees a girl so beautiful he can’t believe his eyes. He should walk away and not look back, but she calls to him like nothing ever has before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Will Ragnar do every dirty thing in the book to his sweet, innocent Bee? Come on, this is us, and we wouldn’t let you down! Find out just how far he’s willing to go to make her his. Spoiler: it’s all the way!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Ever heard the saying, never follow the big bad wolf into the woods? &lt;br /&gt;Well, I wish I had listened to Little Red Riding Hoods advice. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; One bite. That's all it took to turn Harper into a wolf and change her entire life. &lt;br /&gt;Turning eighteen was meant to be a fun night out, a party in the woods to celebrate with friends, but it ends in disaster. &lt;br /&gt;Harper wakes up in a car, on her way to a pack of wolves; ones she must live with. The sexy and alluring alpha welcomes her, declaring her his mate. Only Harper’s best friend, a vampire she grew up with, tells her she belongs with him. &lt;br /&gt;Now, Harper must keep her mates from destroying each other. Can there be a happy ending for them all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the wolves are at war with other kinds of shifters. When one of them turns up, demanding she is their mate, will her alpha, who she rejected, fight for her? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Will the vampire, who loves her, help her pack? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;18+ menage romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Yuri&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago Yulia, my niece, lost both her parents. Two months ago she completely stopped speaking. Her psychiatrist thought a gentler presence around the house might be good for her. She suggested a nanny for the child. Naturally, I would do anything that would help her regain her happy childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn't expect the woman who stepped into my office. Yeah, she's got my attention, all right, but for all the wrong reasons. I sure as hell don't need this ripe fruit to distract me day and night in my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell her she hasn't got the job, and watch her leave my study, but Fate has other plans. Resistance is futile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;April&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lives in a white mansion in London's Knightsbridge, a magnet for playboys and Russian billionaires.   Big, burly bodyguards look at me as if I've not come for a job interview, but to steal the family silver. Whatever. I maintain my professionalism, I'm determined to get this intriguing job of caring for the girl who refuses to speak. A prim woman leads me to his study. She knocks, and a deep, smooth voice beckons us to enter. The door opens and I set eyes on Yuri Volkov.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His eyes are like a wolf's. Pitiless. Mesmerizing Dangerous. Obviously he Is drop dead wrong but, I can't stop imagining his big, tanned hands caressing every inch of me. After the briefest interview in the history of interviews he informs me I haven't got the job. As I walk away, humiliated, from his study, it happens. The unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm suddenly back in the game.</description>

  <description>Not all heroes are good guys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a body count on his soul and blood on his hands, Killian Nox lived in the gray. Ruthlessly single-minded, if he wanted something, it was his. And when it came to the gorgeous lass with a fiery attitude, he didn’t just want her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He needed her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With southern-bred manners and a snark all her own, Augusta ‘Gus’ Allan was a connoisseur of cheap wine, delicious Mexican food, and good TV. Unfortunately, her taste in men wasn’t as well-developed. When her knight in shining armor turned out to be a douche in tinfoil, Gus never expected her real hero to be a sexy-accented, tattooed beast of a man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he was exactly who she needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gus had no clue how comforting a monster in the dark could be... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Nox. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to awesome things like adult content and language... wink, wink, nudge, nudge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Happily Ever Alpha World novella is a crossover of The Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It features glimpses of familiar faces from Hyde and Seek, Best Kase Scenario, and Until November. However, it can be enjoyed as a standalone.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5*<br /><br />I’m so glad we get to catch up with Charls. I really enjoyed this one as Laurent in disguise travels with Charls as young Charls.<br /><br />Charls (the older) is brilliantly clueless and this made for a wonderful short read.]]>

  <description>The epic conclusion to the internationally acclaimed Captive Prince trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damianos of Akielos has returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His identity now revealed, Damen must face his master Prince Laurent as Damianos of Akielos, the man Laurent has sworn to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the brink of a momentous battle, the future of both their countries hangs in the balance. In the south, Kastor’s forces are massing. In the north, the Regent’s armies are mobilising for war. Damen’s only hope of reclaiming his throne is to fight together with Laurent against their usurpers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced into an uneasy alliance the two princes journey deep into Akielos, where they face their most dangerous opposition yet. But even if the fragile trust they have built survives the revelation of Damen’s identity – can it stand against the Regent’s final, deadly play for the throne?</description>

  <description>Derek aka Phoenix is a New York City fire fighter and has dedicated his life to saving people. When he loses two of his men in the line of duty, he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to see the light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when an angel in the form of a woman named Fia appears before him, his world as he knows it is turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fia has been working hard to make money so she can finish her last semester of school. A fire in her building sets her back to square one, but the fireman who saves her turns out to be more than she ever expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once he gets his arms around her, there’s no letting go. Because when you’ve got your forever in your arms, nothing else matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is hot and fast insta-love that ignites the pages. It’s burning heat that combusts into an inferno of lava. Okay, that’s all the fire words I could come up with. Now insert a pun about a big hose. It’s quick, dirty, and ridiculously over the top.</description>

  <description>Teeny has just moved into a brand new place and curiosity has gotten the better of her. When she meets her new neighbor she’s not prepared for how big or how hot he is. The gentle giant has her fantasies running wild and she’s learning what it means to love thy neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull has always been the biggest in the room and it’s annoying. He’s a former security guard who now does online consulting to stay away from the stares. But when his young little neighbor wants to make friends he can’t help himself. He’s tearing down all his walls and breaking the rules just to have a shot at what he never thought was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Will Bull be too big to make Teeny his? Will it somehow work anyway? You betcha! Find out what happens when this bull meets his china shop…because it’s wild!</description>

  <description>The city of Haven Hart rests under the heel of Christopher Manos. He reigns over the most dangerous and deadliest citizens as the most powerful crime boss the city has seen in generations. Yet, for the last five years, the harshest edges of his nature have been tempered by the loving devotion of his husband, Snow, and the nephew Christopher adores like a son. His life is a balance of darkness and light until a birthday trip for his nephew, Simon, is interrupted by a hail of bullets and explosions, threatening to destroy it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snow has found a home, a family, and the love of one of Haven Hart’s most powerful men. When Christopher and Simon are kidnapped, Snow risks everything to find his family. Utilizing specialized skills he learned on the streets and the finer points of running a city from his crime boss husband, Snow takes on roles he never dreamed he would--protector, leader, and avenger. No one threatens his family and lives. Experienced enough to know he can’t do this alone, Snow calls in every favor he is owed, risking his life promising favors in return, all to save his family and the man he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sins of the Manos crime family are escaping the dark recesses of the past and threatening the bright future of everything Snow and Christopher have built. Yet, even with the help of some unlikely and uniquely dangerous people, Snow finds himself wondering if their efforts will be enough to save the two most important people in his life. Will the loving family Snow has finally found be taken from him forever?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;RELEASE DATE 19 APRIL 2019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to make a huge mistake. &lt;br /&gt;And when I say huge, I mean, approximately ten inches worth of mistake. &lt;br /&gt;But it was exactly what the doctor ordered. &lt;br /&gt;And after the week I’d had, this was just what I needed. A night of big bad mistakes with a big bad man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Honey Scott&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding out your boyfriend is a cheating loser is a real buzz kill. Finding out you’re actually the other woman, is devastating. Call it temporary insanity, but I decide the best way to get over the loser I’d dated for two years is to get under a biker with a hard body with an even harder c**k.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s going to make everything better with five mind-blowing orgasms. But just for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except one faulty condom means my one-night stand isn’t so one-night after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caleb Calley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a night of insane sex, the beautiful blue-eyed redhead gave me the slip. And even with all the pussy on offer afterwards, I can’t get her off my mind. So when she turns up at the Kings of Mayhem MC compound I’m quick to give her a second night of amazing sex and crazy orgasms. But this time, I’m not ready to let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem— she’s not interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if she thinks she’s going to give me the slip again, she’s got another thing coming. I know she is keeping a secret from me but I don’t care what it is. I want her and I’m going to make her mine.</description>

  <description>As the Light Festival draws near, the Něssyrians craft paper lanterns, awaiting the most important holiday of the year. &lt;br /&gt;The Lyliňg Fighting House, too, prepares for celebration--by laying fresh sand onto the arena and setting up a match against their top pit fighter, the unrivalled Yüuzuki Ōren. &lt;br /&gt;His &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; match. One he can't win. &lt;br /&gt;With the odds more than stacked against him, the gorgeous Barbarian is as good as dead. Unless his lover, healer Ĥaiatto Ẽkana, proves himself every bit as determined as he is clever and finds a way to protect the man he'd stop at nothing to save.</description>

  <description>If happiness is a gift. &lt;br /&gt;Then Cameron Stanton is my Santa Claus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can’t tell you the exact moment I fell in love with him. &lt;br /&gt;Only that I did. &lt;br /&gt;With every glance, every touch, every minute…. he stole a little more of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all men are created equal. &lt;br /&gt;Well that’s a blatant lie! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know because I met Gods gift to women in Vegas, &lt;br /&gt;I pretended he was my husband to get rid of another man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He took our fake marriage seriously and it became his personal goal to consummate. &lt;br /&gt;He spoke to me in French and I lied to him in German. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His laughter was addictive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I thought what happens in Vegas would stay in Vegas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until it didn't. &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Stanton turned up where I least expected and my lies came back to haunt me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The attraction is palpable. &lt;br /&gt;The secrets unchangeable. &lt;br /&gt;I need him more than air. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a stand alone, contemporary romance.</description>

  <description>A retired SEAL is about to face his toughest assignment yet. As a nanny… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fixer. Bodyguard. Advocate. Brann Calder is expected to play all these roles and more as a member of Torus Intercession, a security firm guaranteed to right what’s wrong. In the military, catastrophe was his specialty. Five months out of the service, Brann is still finding his way, so a new assignment might be just what he needs. Unless it includes two things sure to make a seasoned, battle-trained veteran nervous: life in a small town, and playing caretaker to two little girls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emery Dodd is drowning in the responsibility of single fatherhood. He’s picked up the pieces after losing his wife and is ready to move on now, hopeful that his engagement to a local patriarch’s daughter will not only enrich his community but will grant his daughters some stability too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing standing in Emery’s way is that he can’t he seem to keep his eyes—and hands—off the former soldier he’s hired to watch his girls until the wedding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emery’s future is riding on his upcoming nuptials, but being with Brann makes him and his family feel whole again. Too bad there’s no way for them to be together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or is there? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You can’t bargain with death if you’ve already sold your soul.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Special Agent Patrick Collins has been reassigned by the Supernatural Operations Agency to New York City. Navigating his new relationship with Jonothon de Vere, the werewolf he’s now soulbound to, is nothing compared to dealing with territorial disputes between the vampires and werecreatures who call the five boroughs home. But the delicate treaties that have kept the preternatural world in check are fraying at the edges, and the fallout is spilling into the mundane world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Manhattan’s club scene is overrun with the vampire drug known as shine and the subways have become a dumping ground for bodies. When the dead are revealed as missing werecreatures, Patrick and Jono find themselves entangled in pack politics twisted by vampire machinations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learning to trust each other comes with problems for both of them, and the gods with a stake in Patrick’s soul debt aren’t finished with him yet. Bound by promises they can’t break, Patrick and Jono must find a way to survive a threat that takes no prisoners and is stalking them relentlessly through the city streets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Old and new betrayals are coming home to roost but the truth—buried in blood—is more poisonous than the lies being spun. Trying to outrun death is a nightmare—one Patrick may never wake up from. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Souls Near &amp;amp; Nigh&lt;/i&gt; is a 104k word m/m urban fantasy with a gay romantic subplot and a HFN ending. It is a direct sequel to &lt;i&gt;A Ferry of Bones &amp;amp; Gold&lt;/i&gt;, and reading the first book in the series would be helpful in enjoying this one. Please see the disclaimer at the beginning of the book for content some readers may find triggering.</description>

  <description>A Jamie Begley Anthology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAVEN SENT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There wasn’t anything Shade didn’t know about his wife, or so he thought. When another man wanted Lily, it didn’t come as a surprise. What did was that she hadn’t told him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His “Angel” had been sent from heaven just for him, not for another who was trying to steal what was his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lessons had to be learned the hard way and “when you burn, you learn” was his favorite lesson to teach.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CHASING RAINBOWS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ice had never believed in happily ever after … until he fell in love with Grace. He had put a ring on her finger, trying to tie her to him before she came to her senses and realized there was nothing redeeming about him. So, he wasn’t surprised that their marriage was on the rocks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be chasing rainbows, trying to find the man she believed he was, but rainbows never lasted, and Ice had never pretended to be anything but what he was—a cold-blooded Predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t realize you don’t have to chase after something that’s already been caught.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HALO FOR THREE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer and Jonas were on the hunt for a woman to share. However, either they couldn’t agree on the right woman, or she wanted no part of being in a ménage. That they found Mika on Valentine’s Day gave them hope that they had finally found the woman that they could spend the rest of their lives with … until she disappeared the next day, leaving them with an empty bed and no way to find her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might have escaped for now, believing she had gotten off scot-free, but the bounty hunters were determined to catch their fleeing third. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not know it yet, but some halos were made to be shared.</description>

  <description>Imagine searching your whole life for answers, and then finally finding them. A part of you is excited to know the truth. Another part of you is damaged, because you realize why it was so hard to learn answers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secrets aren't usually very pretty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the midst of all of it, the four monsters I've gotten too attached to are about to be reunited with the one woman they all once loved so deeply that they sacrificed everything to have an eternity with her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They said they hated Arion, but I never see hatred when they're around him. I see frustration, resentment, anger, and pain, but never hatred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say they hate Idun, but until she returns, I won't know how true that really is. All the pretty monsters don't have simple emotions, because everyone has lived so long that it's gotten entirely too complicated to feel anything too much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only way to figure out what happens next is to stop stalling and start doing, while silently hoping it doesn't cost me everything I never knew I wanted...until it landed in my lap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My life sucks so hard sometimes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Reverse Harem &lt;br /&gt;**Mature content &lt;br /&gt;**Language warning &lt;br /&gt;**Dark Humor &lt;br /&gt;**CANNOT BE READ AS A STAND-ALONE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reading Order: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gypsy Blood &lt;br /&gt;Gypsy Freak &lt;br /&gt;Gypsy Origins &lt;br /&gt;Gypsy Moon</description>

  <description>I'm like a snowball rolling downhill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's the first thing that pops into my mind when I try to explain my life. I don't know exactly 'what' I am, but I do know who I am. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least...I did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes life sends things your way that upend everything you thought you knew, and then slings you in another direction without any sort of harness or warning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it drops someone like me off in the path of four wildly different monsters, who all used to be best friends, but now sort of hate each other and compete over absolutely everything, including...me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life would be easier if I wasn't already attached to those four monsters, but they occasionally let their guard down around me, and I get a glimpse of what has to stay hidden under all those snowball layers, since they already rolled downhill a long time ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm tired of losing people I care about. I'm tired of searching aimlessly for answers. I'm tired of not having the right questions to ask. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm really tired of feeling like my vagina is cursed, but that's obviously lower on the list of priorities. But in my vagina's defense, it may not do tricks, but I keep it pretty. It shouldn't keep scaring men/monsters off so easily, and it's honestly starting to make me feel a little insecure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm finally closer than ever to having all the answers. So long as no new secrets emerge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Reverse Harem Romance</description>

  <description>What's it like to be a monster in a town full of monsters, who don't know you're a monster? &lt;br /&gt;Complicated and a little scary, but doable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What's it like to be the girl who can't die...that everyone seems to always want to kill? &lt;br /&gt;Frustrating as hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What's it like to accidentally raise psychotic alpha vampire everyone fears, who drops a lot of bodies on his first day out as a 'gift' for your troubles? &lt;br /&gt;Terrifying, if I'm being honest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What's it like when that crazed vampire tells you he wants you to be the happy little intermission, during an ongoing ancient story, and expects you to use your vagina to draw in a werewolf alpha, a Van Helsing alpha, and a sexual deviant alpha, so he can have his old friends back? &lt;br /&gt;That's when a girl has to stop, look around, and question her life choices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really don't know how this stuff keeps happening to me. Life was simpler when it was just me accidentally blowing myself up while trying to create potions and shampoo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've lived my life in such secrecy that I've spent most of it lonely. So lonely, in fact, that my best friend is a delusional ghost. I'd rather focus on her than all the crazy things happening in my life at current. Ever since coming to this town, I've had my throat slit by vampires, attracted way too much attention from some powerful alphas, and did a lot of regrettably stupid things because...I'm too gullible for shady monsters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To them, I'm the fool. &lt;br /&gt;To them, I'm the naive girl in over my head. &lt;br /&gt;To them, I'm the pawn on a worn chessboard, while the seasoned players knock me around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I'm still left to figure it all out on my own, because, just like me, no one wants to share their secrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Reverse Harem &lt;br /&gt;**Sexual Content &lt;br /&gt;**DARK HUMOR &lt;br /&gt;**Cannot be read as a stand-alone (Gypsy Blood is book 1.) &lt;br /&gt;**Language warning &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He was powerful, older and my boss, a lethal combination.&lt;br /&gt;Job satisfaction has taken on a whole new meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I lied on my resume, I didn’t expect it to matter.&lt;br /&gt;I mean any child would love me; I was born to be a nanny.&lt;br /&gt;I applied for a position working for a woman, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;But Julian Masters is definitely all man…the kind you dream of licking chocolate from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day was bad. The kids were the spawn of the devil and I spied through a window and caught him doing something obscene…. and equally fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day was worse, he caught me snooping in his bathroom cabinet in my skimpy pyjamas and all hell broke loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third day, I ran over him in a golf cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by day four I had decided that I wanted that chocolate…all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Melted….on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But intelligent, widowed Judges don’t fall for ditzy nannies.&lt;br /&gt;Or do they?</description>

  <description>Marius Everhart is something even mages fear — a shadowmancer. His power marks him as cursed, a creature belonging to the Queen of Shadows. Marius escaped her realm with his memories corrupted and his sanity in tatters, managing to live a fragile, lonely existence at the edges of society. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some might call Ayodele Sauveterre delusional. He prefers the term “optimistic”. With his homeland in danger from invasion, Ayodele will do anything to protect it, even recruit a shadowmancer. Marius’s incredible power and gentle nature make him a perfect addition to Paladin Charm, a new mage guild dedicated to helping rather than exploiting the non-magical populace. The fact that handsome Marius also warms Ayodele’s bed is a wonderful bonus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With support from Ayodele and his new friends in the guild, Marius begins to heal. He’s also quickly falling for the alluring mage, but Ayodele struggles with what’s forming between them. Past experience left Ayodele flippant but guarded, and Marius’s open honesty unnerves him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they grow closer, Paladin Charm prepares for a battle with impossible odds. And in the darkness, the Queen of Shadows waits to reclaim Marius and drag him back into a nightmare.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;We vowed forever. What we got was two years.&lt;br /&gt;But now I’m back to take back what was stolen from me.&lt;br /&gt;She’s mine to have, and mine to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Again&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A filthy oil-rig roughneck like me had no business with a wife like her. She was the pretty little flower I never should have put my dirty hands on. But Leanna was my everything. My heart. My obsession. And one year ago, they told me another man took her away from me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…I just found out that was &lt;i&gt;bullshit&lt;/i&gt;. And now, there’s going to be &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt; to pay.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her family never thought I was good enough for her. The wrong side of the tracks, and too rough and savage for their sweet, innocence Leanna. They lied to keep me from her, and her from me. But now that I know the truth?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, now I’m coming back for what’s &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m twice the man I was before—harder, fiercer, and even more obsessed. For richer or for poorer? Well, she had me poor and loved every second of my rough hands pinning her to our marriage bed. I’ve made my fortune since, but I’m ready to throw it all away to get her back in my arms where she belongs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bastards that took her from me think they can keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…They’re dead fucking wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year ago, I thought I lost her. Two days ago, I learned the truth. And tonight, I’m taking back my bride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I’ll burn the whole world down to get her if I have to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking for a ridiculously over the top alpha hero completely obsessed with claiming his one and only? You’re in the right place!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one’s equal parts sweeter than sugar and hotter than sin, and I’m pretty sure you’re going to eat it right up ;).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this standalone is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Samantha Taylor turned her back on her wealthy family to focus on social work. Those who know her think she’s the heart of kindness. Those who know her really well know she’s in a never-ending battle to make up for the harm her family’s companies inflict on the world. Which is how she finds herself at a charity bachelor auction of all places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oops, she was supposed to bid on her bff’s brother as a favor and accidentally bid on the wrong guy. Sue her for not being able to tell one stick-in-the-mud CEO from another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstage, she goes to tell him not to worry about having to go through with a date or anything, but the oafish billionaire cuts her off dismissively. Looks her up and down, hands her a card with his assistant’s contact details, and reminds her that sex is definitely off the table. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, she’ll call the assistant all right and have her make sure he wears jeans and comfortable shoes and to pick her up at seven a.m. The only “hammering” this guy is going to be doing is at Habitat for Humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad he turns out to be nothing like she expected.</description>

  <description>I'm not all that special, really. Or uncommon. I'm sure there are a lot of girls with old gypsy blood who see the dead, have killer cults hunting their family, and turn into something that gets scary when they panic. Yep. Completely unoriginal, if I do say so myself. &lt;br /&gt;Move along. Nothing to see here. Nope. I'm just an ordinary girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wish people would believe that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been labeled as one thing or another for most of my life: &lt;br /&gt;Death Girl. &lt;br /&gt;Crazy Gypsy Girl. &lt;br /&gt;Gothic Chick. &lt;br /&gt;Monster... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took my mother's death for me to finally start getting answers about what's really been going on. Unfortunately, most of the answers come from men...who aren't just men. Somehow, I've gone and landed myself in a world truly filled with monsters, and I'm starting to think this is where I should have been all along. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only...I don't understand what's going on. I'm walking into the middle of a story that's thousands of years old, and I'm the new girl on the block who doesn't have a clue how this world even works. My only guides happen to be the most lethal of the bunch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They decide who lives or dies. They decide who gets stabbed or tortured. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've gone and drawn attention to myself, and the ones paying attention are the ones everyone else seems to fear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do these things always happen to me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Reverse Harem &lt;br /&gt;**Language warning &lt;br /&gt;**Sexual content &lt;br /&gt;**Dark Humor</description>

  <description>It’s Lily Parker’s first day at a new high school. She’s a senior finishing her last semester, and all she wants to do is graduate and get out of town. Her home life is a secret hell, and she’s trying to find a way out. But everything changes when Ren says hello and sees right through to her truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren Hendrick’s succeed's at everything he touches, including football. But he’s never been passionate about anything. He’s quiet and keeps to himself, which pisses people off. But he can’t find the desire to care. He’s lived a life without color, until Lily walks in and lights up his world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their story is one of sweet young love and finding your forever before you can even dream of what that is. It’s one of protecting what belongs to you and having the courage to follow your heart, no matter your age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Call your dentist and schedule an appointment, because you’re going to get nothing but cavities from this sugary book. Ren and Lily start off so innocent, but by the time it’s over, you’re gonna need to hose yourself off. We’re talking two virgins who turn into maniacs. You’re welcome!</description>

  <description>What do you do when your career is stagnant and one of the biggest businessmen in the city offers you the opportunity of a lifetime? To plan a New Year’s Eve party for thousands of his employees. On too short of notice. With no plan. With an almost assured chance of failure? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you take it, of course. Or at least, that is what Sage Walters decides to do, sure that if she could pull it off, this would be the job that would catapult her career to a whole new level that doesn’t involve one gender reveal party after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of course, she’d have to not only contend with the impossibility of pulling off the event on such short of notice, but the overbearing, micromanaging, condescending CEO of Calgary Industries - Grant Calgary himself, their constant bickering, and the completely irrational, unprofessional - yet undeniable - chemistry between them…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is a short, light, but sexy New Year’s Eve novella</description>

  <description>Frank Mercer is a forty-year-old high school math teacher, newly divorced from his husband and struggling to make his mortgage payments. He thinks his problems will be solved by a romance with his old friend Jonathan Butler, a man Frank has secretly admired for over twenty years. But Jonathan is engaged to Marcus Pierce, his unfaithful longtime boyfriend. When Jonathan asks Frank to serve as best man at his wedding, Frank must choose between supporting his friend and speaking from his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julio Robles is Frank’s roommate and a popular yoga teacher. Julio’s star student is none other than Marcus, Jonathan’s fiancé and Frank’s nemesis. And Marcus has made it clear he’d like more from Julio than yoga lessons. When Frank asks Julio to pretend to be his boyfriend on a dinner date with Jonathan and Marcus, Julio can’t resist accepting the invitation. And finds himself in over his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank and Julio invent a fake relationship in the face of Marcus and Jonathan’s all-too-real relationship. But which relationship is real, which relationship is fake? Their story leads them to ask themselves fundamental questions about love, friendship, and what it means to be true to one’s partner.</description>

They called him Radu the Handsome, but his beauty was deceiving, and it hid a deadly secret...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With high ambitions as a journalist, Juliet Jochs travels to the Carpathians to investigate a mysterious and unnaturally beautiful prince. She suspects that he's a dangerous man, and that this mission may cost her life.

She must keep her head above the water if she is to save herself, run away and not look back before he consumes her completely. But can she resist opening the last door to his most terrible secret?</description>

Thankfully she’s rescued by a dark knight named Rocco, but his heroic act is seen as a violent attack after the judge is bought off and Rocco is sent to jail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocco Lang took one look at the blonde and knew he had to save her.

You’re damn right they can! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This alpha might be behind bars, but he’s still running the show. Grab your jumpsuits and cozy up because this prison romance is everything your Valentine’s Day needs!</description>

  <description>Another body in a string of ritualistic murders, a serial killer who’s getting cocky; Detective Derek Childress thinks this day just can’t get any worse. &lt;br /&gt;And then he meets his new partner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investigator Kayle Perrine is a Variant: one of several races of once-thought mythical creatures who now live among and lord-over humankind. Led by a group of vampires called the Clan Gentry, the Variants protect their own, just as they did when Derek’s previous partner was killed by one, nearly a year ago. Now that Perrine’s on the case, Derek expects a cover-up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kayle Perrine has worked his whole life to prove himself, but being paired up with a boorish mundane like Derek Childress is feeling more like punishment than reward. Derek is so blinded by his prejudice against Variants, that he refuses to see the evidence Kayle finds blatantly obvious. The sooner Kayle can close this case, the sooner he can go back home and forget about the infuriating human detective. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brutal attack forges a fragile truce between the two men, driving them together. Derek and Kayle must learn to trust and depend on each other while tempers flare and passions of every kind run hot between them. Yet as they begin to grow closer, one fact continues to keep them apart: they are from different worlds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With time running out to solve this case, Derek and Kayle understand that love may not be enough to overcome prejudice, politics, and murder.</description>

  <description>An MM Post-Apocalyptic Shifter Romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day the dark stranger came was the day Wren Striker’s pack was destroyed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All his life, Wren has known only his clan. His place. His service to his lord. Young, vulnerable, sheltered within one of the last fortresses held by wolves in a ruined, drowning world, Wren was raised to know only one thing: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As an omega, he was born to be his alpha’s mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when the alpha of his pack challenges a stranger trespassing on their lands, a devastating loss to the mysterious, soft-spoken brute of a wolf leaves their pack shattered and without a leader. Yet when the dark stranger demands not dominance, but Wren himself as his price and his prize, Wren finds himself torn from the wolf-eat-wolf world he’s always known to become one half of a pack of two with no home but the wandering road and open sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The strange man known as Ero Wake claims he isn’t an alpha. Isn’t a leader. Isn’t anything but a lone wolf finding a way to survive in a broken world, where dryads and werewolves war for space with humans and halflings; where blood frenzies turn man into beast and beast into monster; where the Echo’s subliminal whispers seek out the unwary and lure them north, to a centuries-old Disc waiting with its eldritch songs that broke the world. But Ero knows more than he lets on, secrets as old as the end of the Earth, and something about the strength beneath his silence calls to every primal thing buried inside Wren. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s animal. It’s instinctive. It’s a need deeper than blood, a craving to belong to Ero and Ero alone. Every day with the much older wolf stokes the mating heat in Wren’s blood higher—yet for Ero, the risk of mating with Wren is too dangerous. Too frightening, when losing control of himself could unleash a beast more feral than any the world has ever seen. Half broken, touched by the Echo, Ero isn’t like any wolf Wren has ever met. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if Ero isn’t careful…he’ll find himself tamed and bending to Wren’s delicate touch, both his heart and his wildness bound up in steel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kate&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a simple plan: go to a bar far away from home, hook up with a stranger I would never see again, and get my first experience before I head off to college. &lt;br /&gt;How was I supposed to know that stranger would turn out to be my dad’s good friend? &lt;br /&gt;And how could I have fallen for him in the span of a single day? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I had no idea she was my friend’s daughter. My &lt;i&gt;minister&lt;/i&gt; friend, for Chrissakes. But once I’ve tasted the forbidden fruit I know there is no going back. She’s sealed my fate, and my heart, with her large expressive eyes and steaming hot body. I know my soul is doomed for the things I’m doing to her, but I don’t care. I’ve fallen hard, and nothing is going to keep us apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Day And Forever&lt;/b&gt; is a standalone romance with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a happily ever after guaranteed. It's a quick, juicy read!.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>On a night out, four friends witness a stranger in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;They decide to do nothing to help.&lt;br /&gt;Later, a body washes up on the banks of the Thames – and the group realises that ignoring the woman has left blood on their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why did each of them refuse to step in? Why did none of them want to be noticed that night? Who is really responsible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And is it possible that the victim was not really a stranger at all?</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>James Bryant is trying her best to quit her job as a thief, but she needs one more big job to get the money she needs. When she literally runs into a man on the street and takes his wallet, she never imagines that the muscled beast would come back to haunt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett Hughes lives a life of luxury and solitude. There’s nothing he can’t get if he wants it, but when a pickpocket catches his attention and gets away he finds it impossible to track her down. Luckily for him he knows people in all the wrong places, and as soon as he gets his hands on her, he’ll make sure she’s bound to him in every possible way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It’s the newest addition to our baby-making series and it’s filthier than ever before! If you loved Coach, Mechanic, Thief, Kingpin, and Judge, then this one is waiting for you to love it.</description>

  <description>Six years ago, Harold Dalton framed me for theft and sent me to jail to steal my diamond discovery. He gave his daughter to Jack Clarke in exchange for the excavation rights. Today, I’m walking free, and I’m coming for him with a vengeance. Six years of cruelty make beasts out of men. I’m going to take back what he stole from me, and more. I’m not interested in his properties or shares. I don’t want his small change. I want his biggest asset. Beautiful, mentally unstable, Angelina Dalton-Clarke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth billions, she’s the wealthiest widow in the country, and also the craziest. Her self-harming tendencies had Jack declare her incompetent before he put a gun to his head and blew out his brains. Lina isn’t allowed to touch a cent of her riches. Her father manages her finances. He has all the signing power. As her husband, that 'chore' will fall to me. But if she thinks I only want her for her money, she’s sadly mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book is a stand-alone. No cliffhangers.</description>

  <description>Ava fudged a little on her résumé to land her dream job. She’s been working her curvy booty overtime to get her boss’s new lingerie line off the ground. But when her boss’s brother comes in and says Ava should be the face—and body—of the campaign, she’s having second thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas knows what he wants, and the second he sees every lush inch of Ava all bets are off. She’s not only the one for the job but the one for him, and he’ll do whatever it takes to make her see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This obsessed hero doesn’t hold back, and we were more than happy to let him take the reins. Find out what happens when the thick girl gets the alpha and things really heat up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer is available &lt;b&gt;FOR FREE&lt;/b&gt; on the podcast &lt;a href="http://readmeromance.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt; Read Me Romance&lt;/a&gt; starting Monday November 5th! &lt;a href="http://readmeromance.com/books/closer-by-alexa-riley/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Subscribe now!&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>After an epically bad blind date, and far too much tequila, waitress/bike messanger Zoey Eastgate swore off men forever and got a tattoo that says ‘love bites’. Maybe she shouldn’t have tempted fate. Because now love, in the form of a very powerful Mafia wolf, has bitten her right on the ass, on a full moon. And according to the Blood Oath Pack, the “moon-bite” means she is now the mate of Dominic Lombardi. &lt;br /&gt;Now her new “husband” is appearing everywhere – no matter how far she runs and no matter how well she hides. He’s crowding her world, refusing to take no for an answer, letting her know that on the next full moon, she’ll be his bride. If only her body didn’t respond so strongly to the Capo of the most corrupt mob pack on the west coast. If only he didn’t threaten her family and her livelihood one minute – and then serenade her with sexy Italian love songs which she can’t understand a single word of, the next. &lt;br /&gt;If only new dangers weren’t rearing their ugly head and threatening not just Zoey, but all of Encantado, the supernatural sin city she calls home. When dark magic comes too close to home, will she stop running long enough for her wiseguy werewolf to claim his bride – or will she find herself fitted with a cement overcoat, sleeping with the fishes?</description>

  <description>Her life – the system. Her job – a secret case. Her problem – sinfully hot Lieutenant Aiden Davis who watches her every step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since mankind found a cure for cancer, the world seems to be a better place. The price? Blood donations from the entire population. For the rest of their lives. And the worst thing? Jordan Lively has the rarest blood type, so her blood is extremely valuable.&lt;br /&gt;She’s an NYPD detective with heart and soul, but then a mysterious case falls into her lap, one that could cost her more than her job if anyone finds out she even knows about it. She's compelled to get to the bottom of it, even under the watchful eye of her new boss—sexy-as-hell Lieutenant Aiden Davis.&lt;br /&gt;Can Jordan solve the case that will threaten the system? A system that saved millions of lives? Duty or honor - a choice no detective should ever have to make. Now, if she can just leave love out of it…</description>

Brought up to believe she will 'never make old bones' she lives a quiet and lonely existence, hiding away her excessive freckles and red hair from a world that believes her to be hideously misshapen and ugly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day her uncle arranges a marriage of convenience for her, a marriage in name only with a young puppet groom... but Sir Roland does not show up. In his place turns up his bastard-born brother Mason Vawdrey. And dark, forceful Mason is no-one's puppet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things are about to get interesting at Cadwallader Castle.

  <description>On a night out, four friends witness a stranger in trouble. They decide to do nothing to help. &lt;p&gt;Later, a body washes up on the banks of the Thames – and the group realises that ignoring the woman has left blood on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why did each of them refuse to step in? Why did none of them want to be noticed that night? Who is really responsible?&lt;/p&gt; And is it possible that the victim was not really a stranger at all? </description>

      <![CDATA[2.5*<br /><br /><br />This book sounded fabulous and I was positively giddy as I settled in to read it but...<br /><br />It soon became apparent that this wouldn’t be the book I’d expected. The four main characters are selfish, self-centred and just plain unlikeable. This is obviously deliberatel...]]>

  <description>A group of women walk into a bar…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like the start of a crude joke, right? Yeah, well, the joke's on me because I'm investigating the gorgeous one in the heels with the great ass. Jensen Montgomery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm treading that area between right and wrong, good and bad, where sin and honor meld to become gray. Not that I haven't been here before. Hell, I’ve made my career in the gray. I never hesitate going to battle when my gut tells me I'm right. And right now, my gut—among other things—is speaking loud and clear about Jen Montgomery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s in a bad situation. Not just bad—deep and black and ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m about to make it worse. She just doesn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This author is also a mom who runs a PG-13 home. This book is not PG-13. If you are under the age of 18, do NOT pick up this book. This author doesn’t enjoy mama-drama of any sorts. Do her a favor and walk away.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />There’s lots of reviews for this book so I’ll keep mine short.<br /><br />Eli is an absolutely fabulous character and I also really liked Jen. She’s a strong attractive intelligent female.<br /><br />I had it all figured out very early on or rather I thought I did. Actually while the villain is o...]]>
