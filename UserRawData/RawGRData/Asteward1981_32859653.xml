  <description>Holly Lane has spent her life under the crushing thumbs of her cop father and controlling mother. Now, well into her twenties, she’s finally getting a fresh start and moving into her own apartment. Breaking away from her parents should be easy, but how can Holly begrudge their overprotective nature when their other daughter was murdered by an outlaw biker years ago? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his brand-spankin’ new patch, Little Jack has a satisfying life in the Hell’s Handlers MC. Sure, the town’s new sheriff is messing with his club, but it’s nothing they can’t handle. Life only gets better when LJ’s dream woman walks out of his fantasies and into the vacant apartment next to his. Holly is sweet as sugar, curvy in ways that make LJ’s mouth water, and the woman can bake like no other. Personal demons keep LJ from chasing a long-term relationship with any woman, but that doesn’t mean he can’t have a little fun with his hot new neighbor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly is pretty sure life is finally on the right track when she meets LJ on her first day in town. Incredibly tall, bearded, tattooed, and strong enough to unload her car without breaking a sweat, her new neighbor just might be perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With outrageous chemistry and a genuine liking for each other, Holly and LJ seem destined for an explosive encounter until a tornado rolls through their budding relationship in the form of Holly’s father. As the new town sheriff, her father only has one item on his agenda: eliminate the Hell’s Handlers MC.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes an unexpected love story that starts long before the lovers meet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d never forgotten him—a man I’d yet to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Quinn was my childhood pen pal, the British boy who couldn’t have been more different from me. Over the years, through hundreds of letters, we became best friends, sharing our deepest, darkest secrets and forming a connection I never thought could break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, out of the blue, a new letter arrived. A scathing one—one with eight years of pent-up anger. I had no choice but to finally come clean as to why I stopped writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin forgave me, and somehow we were able to rekindle our childhood connection. Only now we were adults, and that connection had grown to a spark. Our letters quickly went from fun to flirty to downright dirty, revealing our wildest fantasies. So it only made sense that we would take our relationship to the next level and see each other in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Griff didn’t want to meet. He asked that I trust him and said it was for the best. But I wanted more—&lt;i&gt;more Griff, in the flesh&lt;/i&gt;—so I took a big chance and went looking for him. People have done crazier things for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I found could change everything.</description>

  <description>People say young love never lasts. They say you should wait and grow up first, you should figure out who you are. But those people didn’t know us. They didn’t know that she didn’t like shoes and Christmas was her favorite time of the year. They didn’t know that she liked to feel the cold dirt run through her fingers and floppy hats were a must when planting flowers. Curly hair was meant to be wild and Fireflies were meant to be chased. Paint wasn’t just for walls and ceilings but for noses and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our love was the rarest kind of love and I held onto it with everything I had. But you see, Sara Williams wasn’t in control of her choices. Her mind betrayed her and was her hearts worst enemy. Sometimes we are only meant to have a certain amount of time with the person we love. Sometimes a lifetime isn’t enough. But you take what you’re given and you make the best of every moment. This is a story about love, life and never giving up. This is a story about a woman who tried to be better for a man and a man who loved a woman more than his next breath. This is a story about us… Sara and Cash Williams.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
   With devoted fans and a panty-melting gaze, Jayce of Feral Silence is an untouchable rockstar god. 
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although she tries to be unbiased in her online reviews, amateur music critic Ailey can’t help swooning over Jayce’s musical genius. That doesn’t escape the notice of Neil, the guy Ailey’s been flirting with online. Ailey reassures him: She would never chase after a rockstar like some desperate groupie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Ailey gets a summer internship at Jayce’s music label, her resolve is tested. Although she has strong feelings for Neil, she’s finding it impossible to resist her attraction to Jayce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when a rockstar god meets the one girl who sees beyond his cocky facade? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feral Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; is a sexy &lt;strong&gt;ménage&lt;/strong&gt; rockstar romance. It is the first novel in the &lt;strong&gt;Feral Silence series&lt;/strong&gt; but can be read as a standalone with a HEA.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A practically-virginal law school graduate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two emotionally-frozen men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One erotic bucket list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Melissa Winter is dumped by her boyfriend the night before their month-long trip to the islands, she gathers her strength and boards the plane—alone. But when she finds herself without a place to stay, she must rely on the two sexy strangers she met on the flight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Strauss and Jack Jackson have been dancing around their attraction for years. But when the three of them come together, kindness leads to lust. Lust leads to love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A forbidden love that could cost Missy her entire future.</description>

  <description>It’s finally my time…&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their damn breaking point, why did the president of my MC’s daughter have to be mine? She was everything I wanted, and nothing I could have. Being a prospect was hard enough. Living with my father that I had only known for a few years wasn’t making life any easier. And there I was, ready to jeopardize it all for love. I went to Vilas to figure out where I came from, little did I know that I wasn’t just going to be passing through. This life was pumping through my veins my whole life, I just didn’t know it until I walked into the Unacceptable’s bar for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Raine Hellock was my kryptonite and come hell or high water, I was going to figure out how to make her mine.</description>

  <description>The loyalty that binds me to the biker gang I've been in my whole life isn’t loyalty at all. It’s fatigue. Exhaustion from the game I've played for so many years. &lt;br /&gt;I've had fictitious freedom for five years but I knew eventually they'd be back. I was expecting it after all. &lt;br /&gt;What I wasn't expecting was Ramsey. She was supposed to come in and out of my life, quickly like a fast-moving storm. But against her own plans, she’s been thrust into my world. The only problem is, the freedom I need is solely based on knowing the game. &lt;br /&gt;And she just changed it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't fully know Jimmy Stenson and I don't entirely understand him but I want him. &lt;br /&gt;Against every fiber of sense in my brain, and every morsel of caution in my heart. I do. &lt;br /&gt;He's a single dad- with the world's cutest kids. He's my boss. He's my enemy....and after a strange kind of agreement; my friend. &lt;br /&gt;He's going to ruin me if I don't get free of him. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad the skeleton's in his closet had the same idea. &lt;br /&gt;Biker gang...Motorcycle Club...The Brass...none of it mattered when it all ended with me tied to a chair, begging for mercy from a demon in a leather cut.</description>

  <description>I can look, but I can’t touch.&lt;br /&gt;As the enforcer of The Lost Boys MC, I am used to getting my hands dirty. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve always kept my emotions in check. &lt;br /&gt;It helps given the position I am in. &lt;br /&gt;When I was tasked with watching over our President’s sister, I was ready for it. &lt;br /&gt;What I wasn’t ready for, is how that beauty would pull at my heart. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve known Ella for years. &lt;br /&gt;After a horrible break up with her ex, all I wanted to do was protect her. &lt;br /&gt;But now, all I want is to bend her over and make her mine. &lt;br /&gt;I know I should resist her. &lt;br /&gt;But I think my heart has other plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is the first book of The Lost Boys MC.</description>

  <description>No matter how much you plan or try to prepare for what's to come, life always sends you on an alternate path.&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;We're taking each curve in the road as it bends.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Except what do you do when you don't see the curve coming?&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;We're struggling, learning to navigate in total darkness.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One breath.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One second.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One minute.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One hour.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One day at a time, we're learning to live with our unexpected fight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

But read in order so your not confused but read however you want. Just when I think Teagen can’t write a better book she goes and does it even better. Can’t wait to see what’s next....]]>

  <description>It’s finally my time. &lt;br /&gt;Time to escape from my mother, her crazy antics and questionable morals. I'm getting the heck out of Dodge, leaving the trailer park, to make something of myself. Everything was fine until I walked into The Unacceptables' bar and met Abel Hellock. With his gorgeous muscles, tattoos, motorcycle and perfect smile, my knees quaked. My life was about to be sucked back into the seedy underbelly I fought so desperately to climb out of. &lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine until I met my step-brother for the first time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**18+ for sexual situations, language, and adult content.** &lt;br /&gt;It is a Step-Brother &amp;amp; MC romance! &lt;br /&gt;This book is a standalone!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Raze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I laid eyes on her in that run-down diner, I had no idea who she was. All I knew was she was sexy as sin and the next star in my wet dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out that rockin’ body and sly smile belonged to none other than Minx— Savage Menaces MC princess... and my club President’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The club has always come first for me, and settling down was never part of my plan. But this chick makes me want things I’ve never even dreamed of before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the club life might destroy everything I saw possible between us.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; I can't even imagine what I'd do with a man like him. He wants no part of a girl like me. So how come he can't stay away, and I can't stop thinking what if?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kayla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life isn't easy. Single mom, minimum wage, family drama. You know the story. I've come a long way in a short time, though, and it's all worth it. For Jimmy. My grumpy little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a hot biker charms his way into our lives, tempting me into wanting more. I want to go for it, but how can I trust myself when I've screwed up so badly in the past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm an easy kind of guy in a rough world. Yeah, I got a record, but I also got my club, my ride, and the open road. Life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't need no hassle, and from recent experience, woman is the very definition. I sure don't need to be messin' with a girl young enough to get carded, cartin' along a six-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is she livin' all up in my head? And how am I gonna stop my past from screwin' up this good thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charge&lt;/i&gt; is a 70,000-word, single mom, older man/younger woman, motorcycle club romance. It's got heart, heat, and a lil' dirt. This novel is intended for adult readers (18+) due to strong language, violence, possible triggers, and explicit intimate scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standalone. Safe. HEA.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>First book by this author. </strong><br /><br />This is the first book I’ve read by this author. I enjoyed this book. A slow burn romance that had great characters and chemistry. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because there were quite a few grammar issues in it.

  <description>Nothing in life has ever come easy for the boy from the other side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother that left. A father that hit. A brother that protected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say everything happens for a reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joss Hess has spent his entire life looking for that reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly killing a man and barely avoiding prison, Joss finds himself sentenced to 18 months on Briscoe Ranch, where certain things are expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard work. Manners. Responsibility. Respect. Worst of all—anger management and restraint. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he fails, Joss will be sent back to the state penitentiary to serve the remainder of his sentence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One road block stands between Joss and his freedom: &lt;br /&gt;Ren Briscoe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised by ranchers, Ren Briscoe has been around men her entire life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home on summer vacation, she quickly realizes that Joss Hess is unlike any man she has ever encountered before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hates everything about him…his filthy mouth, arrogant attitude, the way he makes fun of her purity ring and her boyfriend. Mostly, she hates him because no matter how hard she fights it. Joss occupies her every thought. He may be the convict serving his sentence; but the real prisoner is Ren.</description>

  <description>Freak has watched his brothers fall for the women they love time and time again and is more than familiar with the signs of a man about to hand over his heart. &lt;br /&gt;When Carnie comes tumbling into the clubhouse asking for help, all it takes is a bat of her innocent stare and sassy tongue for Freak to know what is about to happen. But when he finds out how old she is, he hesitates to stake his claim. As a Fallen Lord through and through, he will make sure to protect her even though he’s promised himself not to touch her. &lt;br /&gt;Can Carnie convince Freak age is just a number, or is he on a one way track out of her life?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Raven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raven‘s secrets have shaped the woman she is; solitary and closed off. &lt;/i&gt;After being let down by the one person that should have always been there, Raven has built her wall up so high, nobody could possibly scale them. She takes care of herself. She has her own back. She might live surrounded by her brother’s club, the Fallen Lords MC, but the family and brotherhood they preach is a load of crap and she isn’t buying any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babysitting his president’s baby sister isn’t a hardship. Keeping Raven safe from the Ultra isn’t a problem for a man like Clash either. Keeping her from being destroyed by her inner demons is what threatens to bring him to his knees. When truths come to light and clash with reality, Clash is determined to be the one Raven can count on. &lt;i&gt;Even if she refuses to admit it’s what she needs.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Lost. Alone. Desolate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wren Glass was done. She couldn’t continue to live the lie everything was okay, when in reality, she was dead inside. After being used and abused by the Hell Captains MC, Wren lands in the lap of Maniac. A man who sees her as nothing more than a chore.&lt;br /&gt;A man just like the one she managed to escape.&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what she thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vengeful. Enraged. Calculated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maniac West isn’t a man to mess with. Not with him and not with his club. When he is assigned to watch over Wren, he ignores how he feels about the woman with the soulless eyes. Something in them makes him crave to return light there. But Wren is a job. No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;That all changes when Wren decides she doesn’t want to live.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A woman battered and bruised from the inside out, with no will to live, needs a hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maniac isn’t a hero, but he will turn hell upside down and burn it to the ground to avenge the woman who fell into his world. Anything to bring back the light in her eyes.</description>

  <description>Guarded. Afraid. Confused. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikki Nomad’s life is in shambles. Growing up in and out of foster care, she rarely lets anyone in. After watching her best friend Karmen fall in love, Nikki starts to soften to the idea of a happily ever after with Fallen Lords V.P., Pipe. &lt;br /&gt;He’s ruggedly handsome with a careless attitude, and it’s the exact lethal and sexy combination that breaks Nikki’s heart, reminding her life is far from a fairytale and making her run away from the few people she loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Stubborn. Careless. Free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pipe Mark cares about one person and one person only. &lt;br /&gt;A revolving door of women might spend the night in his bed, but they all know the score before they step foot through the door. &lt;br /&gt;1. No promises. 2. One night. &lt;br /&gt;They all respect the rules and go on their merry way more than satisfied in the morning. &lt;br /&gt;All except Nikki. &lt;br /&gt;Nikki makes Pipe want more. He never has before, but he longs to make promises of ending each night tangled in each other's arms. He just realizes it all too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikki runs, and Pipe ignores the way his body begs for him to chase her. While Nikki thinks Pipe can’t give her what she needs, Pipe is worried Nikki is going to rock his world and never leave it the same.</description>

  <description>Letting his president's sister get kidnapped was not Boink’s finest hour as a member of the Fallen Lords MC. Now it’s time to pay the price protecting the very woman who distracted him from his job in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayra needed a safe place to land and the Fallen Lords clubhouse was the perfect solution, until her past puts everyone in danger. Her only option is to leave with a man she swears can’t stand her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time Boink won’t fail protecting what is his. Whatever is coming for Mayra will have to go through him and the Fallen Lords first.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A sweet, flirty, and heartfelt romance with two roommates that spend one enthralling summer together.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her car accident, Monica believes her dance career is over, despite the positive outlook everyone else has. Instead of trying to get back on her feet, she works on perfecting the art of couch surfing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous author, Gabe Mitchell, doesn’t fare much better. On top of watching his roommate letting her life pass by, he also suffers from a major bout of writer’s block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping a change of scenery will get them both out of their rut, Gabe takes matters into his own hands and whisks Monica away to his own personal haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What neither one of them expects is the attraction to each other to bloom even though Monica will leave Brooksville in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their time together is filled with skimpy bathing suits, sexy fantasy book inspirations, hot tub make-out sessions, and new job prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s plenty to reignite their creative flames, but will it be enough to turn their one short summer into something more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;***This is book two in the Brooksville series and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed! (Book one is Baking With A Rockstar and features Gabe’s brother Hudson.)***&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Enormous, commanding, and hotter than sin, Copper is the only man Shell has ever wanted. Even as a young teen, when it was impossible and taboo to capture the attention of a grown man, she longed for him. For years, Shell clung to the dream of turning eighteen and finally being noticed by the Hell’s Handlers’ rough and gruff president. But the universe had other plans, and she was forced to make a horrible choice. A choice that altered the course of her life forever, sealing her fate and ensuring the dream of being Copper’s ol’ lady would never materialize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years his junior. Daughter of his MC’s former president. Single mother whose deadbeat sperm donor doesn’t provide an ounce of support. Loved as a younger sister by every man in the club. The list of reasons goes on for Copper to stay away from Shell. Problem is, he’s been hot for her for years. Copper finally gets some relief when she moves out of Tennessee, but once she’s back, all those reasons to keep his distance grow weaker by the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unable to fight against his own judgment any longer, Copper finally claims Shell for his own. But once again the universe steps in, revealing secrets with the power to destroy them both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shell will do anything for Copper, even tear out her own heart and confront the most agonizing parts of her past. But will she be too late to save her dream? Will she be too late to save Copper?</description>

  <description>After being disappointed by her family one too many times, Izzy’s convinced the only person she needs is herself. Seeking a life with fewer relationships, she leaves the bustle of the city and moves to small-town Tennessee. Her plans for quiet and solitude don’t last long after she’s adopted by both the men and women of the Hell’s Handlers Motorcycle Club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, Lincoln had a picture-perfect life. Sweet, loving wife, beautiful daughter, enviable career. But one fated night, it’s all wiped out, leaving him scarred both mentally and physically. Now known as Jigsaw, he’s a force to be reckoned with, and a valuable asset to the Hell’s Handlers MC. He’s also done. Done with love, done with dreams, done with women…unless it’s to work off some tension. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite their resolve to avoid entanglements, chemistry blazes between Jig and Izzy and becomes harder to resist with each encounter. When the club’s enemies set their sights on Izzy, the Handlers pull her even further into the fold. Everything Izzy believes about families is challenged as Jig and his club prove they can be counted on again and again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fighting side by side with a fearless woman, even one as smokin’ as Izzy, isn’t something Jig wants, but it might be exactly what he needs. If club business doesn’t destroy them, is there a chance Jig and Izzy can let go of their pasts and find happiness?</description>

  <description>Stephanie Little firmly believes the world exists in two states: right and wrong; good and evil; unlawful and law-abiding. She chose her side the moment she joined the FBI and pledged to rid the world of as many criminals as possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maverick is everything Stephanie isn’t: inked, pierced, flirty, masculine as sin, but most of all, an outlaw. When corruption in Stephanie’s crime-fighting world lands her in the clutches of a dangerous gangster, Maverick is there to keep her sane and battle for her protection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Stephanie’s neat existence so turned around that she can no longer distinguish the good from the evil, she finds herself thrust into a world so gray she can’t see three feet in front of her face. To survive the confusion, she turns to the only person who keeps her grounded: the sexy outlaw who melts her heart and weakens her knees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But law enforcement and criminals can never mix. Not in the way her body and heart are begging for. At some point, someone is going to learn her secret, and when that happens her fierce protector could become her greatest enemy.</description>

  <description>Toni knows what it means to make mistakes. She has experienced firsthand how walking down the wrong path can send life spiraling out of control. Fortunately, she had someone in her life to pull her from the gutter and help set things right again. As penance for her past, she pledges to suppress her baser desires and focus on finding a steady, dependable connection with a man, even if that means embracing a boring lifestyle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zach is anything but dull. As Enforcer for the Hell's Handlers MC, he embodies the outlaw lifestyle, rife with violence, women, and motorcycles. When Toni moves next door, Zach can't resist the possibility of a quick, hot, fling. He discovers, however, that she's not the easy conquest he's used to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Zach works to convince Toni she belongs in his bed, a tenuous relationship with a local gang blows up and threatens his MC family. Zach's world is turned upside down when he's unable to keep the danger from touching his club. As Toni fights to resist Zach's pull, her own peace is shattered by demons from her past. With enemies both old and new barreling down, Toni throws out her rules and turns to Zach for aid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before she can help it, Toni finds herself entrenched in Zach's outlaw world. Is it possible for her to curb her desires, or is she doomed to repeat the mistakes of her past? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;None of it will matter if Zach can't keep the enemies at bay.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>🏍</strong><br /><br />I loved this book. So much humor I would giggle so hard. And just the right amount of suspense. And Zach sweet baby Jesus that man is sex on wheels. And Toni was the perfect heroine. ]]>

  <description>Kyle enjoys working outdoors as the owner of a small landscaping business. Most of his customers stay inside while Kyle and his crew take care of their yards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But not Tracy Dawson, the rich housewife who lives on the hill. Tracy spends summer afternoons beside the pool, watching Kyle from behind her dark sunglasses. Her flirtatious banter and low-cut bathing suits fuel Kyle’s fantasies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tracy invites him into the guest house for a little afternoon delight. But when Tracy admits her husband was watching, Kyle gets ready for a beat-down. Instead, Mr. Dawson makes Kyle an offer he can’t refuse…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; They gave her a week. She gave them her heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel has dated since her divorce, but she's bored with men who act too polite in bed. She's dying for the kind of sex that can set her body aflame. Two gorgeous painters in her office fill her mind with fantasies she'd never act on. Or would she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the men proposition Rachel, she says yes...but only for a week. Ben and Alex heat up Rachel's bed and show her how to take charge of her pleasure. Rachel develops feelings for the painters, and she thinks they feel the same. But when the week ends, can Rachel convince Alex and Ben to think of her as more than just a booty call?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Painters is a 30,000 word standalone MMF novella with a happily ever after.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Shadow Valley where the Dirty Angels MC rules. Get ready to get Down &amp;amp; Dirty because this is Jag’s story…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing Jag, DAMC Road Captain, loves more than his custom bike is Ivy. He’s wanted her ever since he could remember. However, through the years, he’s had to watch her date anyone but him. Even though she was raised in the club, she avoids dating bikers like the plague. Instead, she gravitates toward the complete opposite: geeks and nerds. Something Jag will never be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smart and always independent, Ivy wants to be the property of no man. Growing up in the club, she knows firsthand how they treat women. She regrets the mistake she made by dragging Jag upstairs to his room at the club one drunken night. Ever since then, she’s been doing her best to keep him at arm’s length, though it’s proven difficult. Especially when she finds out his secret, which only endears her to him even more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between secrets, lies, and a violent tangle with a rival club, can the passionate, but headstrong pair find the love and solace they’re looking for in each other’s arms? Or will everything just tumble down around them? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This book can be read as a standalone. It includes lots of steamy scenes, biker slang, cursing, some violence and, of course, an HEA. If you like alpha males who like to take charge, this book is for you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Shadow Valley where the Dirty Angels MC rule. Get ready to get Down &amp;amp; Dirty because this is Zak’s story…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending the last ten years in prison, Zak, former DAMC president, has a few priorities: to reconnect with his “brothers,” to get drunk, and to get laid. Not necessarily in that order. When he spots a stunning woman in the clubhouse and mistakes her for one of the club’s strippers, those priorities get a bit skewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie has no idea what happened to her life. One minute she’s totally focused on building her bakery business, and the next? She’s delivering a cake to the Dirty Angels motorcycle club’s “homecoming” celebration for a member who just got out of prison. Little does she know baking that cake will change the rest of her life, not to mention, make her a target for a rival MC. Normally, Sophie wouldn’t be caught dead with a man like Zak, a tattooed, ex-con, badassed biker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a decades old territory war threatens to rip them apart, Zak will do anything to keep Sophie, his club, and the town safe. But being from two different worlds, the threat they’re under may not be worth the risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Powertools: Hot Rides, Book 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When tragedy struck, the loss of Jordan and Wren's shared lover ripped them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt and shame made it impossible for Agent Jordan Mikalski to look the love of his life in the eye. If he couldn't face her, he sure as hell couldn't live with her or make love to her or even be the man to comfort her in the depths of her grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wren Asbery's mourning threw her into a deep depression she wasn't sure she'd ever climb out of, made worse by Jordan's abandonment in the time of her greatest need. For that she'll never forgive that bastard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of slow healing they realize they're both attracted to the same man, which means they have some things to figure out fast. Will Kason Cox be doomed to lust after two people who can't stand each other or will he be able to become the glue that sticks them back together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a standalone book in the Hot Rides series and includes an HEA with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit with many of your previous favorite characters and see what they're up to now!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Can a marriage of convenience turn into true love? Maybe...with the help of the right man.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn has made mistakes—like sleeping with the wrong people. It’s taken him time to figure out what he wants in bed and out of it. Understandable, since he’s attracted to both men and women and surrounded by a network of friends who seem to have no trouble finding love in any combination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he meets Trevon—the sexiest man ever—on the side of the road, only one thing keeps Quinn from pursuing him: Trevon’s even sexier wife, Devra. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Quinn, Trevon and Devra have led rough lives. Financial and safety concerns forced them into a marriage of convenience they both secretly wish was more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lessons Quinn’s past taught him should put the brakes on his fantasies of propositioning Trevon and Devra for a one-night ménage. But the need to atone for his previous transgressions, along with pure temptation, drives him to bring the struggling couple closer, even if it means breaking his own heart in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a standalone book in the Hot Rides series and includes an HEA with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit with many of your previous favorite characters and see what they’re up to now!&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; My best friend’s sister was off limits; &lt;/b&gt; until the day she sauntered into my classroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s looking to perfect her candy making skills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m looking to teach her all the best ways to use chocolate, none of which include how to properly line a candy mold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’ll discover what it really means to temper chocolate when I stir her up and light her body on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s doesn’t know it, but she was mine the moment she set foot in my kitchen.</description>

  <description>A new, sexy standalone from #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller, Vi Keeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first encountered Ford Donovan, I had no idea who he was…well, other than the obvious. Young, gorgeous, successful, smart. Did I mention young? If I did, it bears repeating. Ford Donovan was &lt;i&gt;too young&lt;/i&gt; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s back up to how it all started. My best friend decided I needed to start dating again. So, without my knowledge, she set up a profile for me on a popular dating site—one that invited men ages twenty-one to twenty-seven to apply for a date. Those nicknamed &lt;i&gt;Cunnilingus King&lt;/i&gt; were told they’d go straight to the top for consideration. The profile wasn’t supposed to go live. Another point that bears repeating—it wasn’t &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, that’s how I met Ford, and we started messaging. He made me laugh; yet I was adamant that because of his age, we could only be friends. But after weeks of wearing me down, I finally agreed to &lt;i&gt;one date only&lt;/i&gt;—my first after twenty years of being with my high school sweetheart. I knew it couldn’t last, but I was curious about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, you know what they say…&lt;i&gt;curiosity kills the cat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs wobbled walking into the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;Ford was seated at the bar. When he turned around, he took my breath away.&lt;br /&gt;His sexy smile nearly melted my panties. &lt;br /&gt;But…he looked &lt;i&gt;so familiar&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;As I got closer I realized why. &lt;br /&gt;He was the son of the neighbor at our family’s summer home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The boy next door&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Only now…he was all man. &lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t seen him in years.&lt;br /&gt;I left the restaurant and planned to put the entire crazy thing behind me. &lt;br /&gt;Which I did. &lt;i&gt;Until summer came&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;And guess who decided to use his family’s summer home this year?</description>

  <description>My family has secrets. I’m always the good girl, doing what’s necessary to keep my loved ones safe. I've kept the darkest secrets from everyone I know. As painful as it is to hold them all inside where they live and gnaw away at me, that’s where they must stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven't seen my closest childhood friend, Christian Bear, since I was a teenager—he hasn't changed a bit. He’s still temperamental and plays by his own rules with the law following two steps behind him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian remembers me. But he doesn’t know the first thing about me anymore. I should've shared my feelings with him the day before I moved away with my family, promising him I'd stay in touch. It broke my heart when he didn't keep his end of the bargain. As a consequence, we haven't spoken in years. Even though Christian and I have always had undeniable chemistry, I won't let him shatter my heart a second time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian has shown up in my life again with secrets of his own, and demanding answers. That doesn't mean I'm willing to give them. He'll know my secrets when I’m ready. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our secrets, the risks we’re taking, and the danger he imposes make it impossible to know what our future holds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either our tethered souls will bind back together, or our secrets will separate us forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tethered Souls is the second spin-off novel from The Nine Minutes Trilogy. It can be read as a standalone, but would most likely be more enjoyable if read after Nine Minutes, Out of Time, and A Gift of Time. It contains major spoilers from the trilogy, and although not necessary, the reader might benefit by understanding the background stories of the main characters that are described in the series. There are many twists and turns in all my books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>RECOMMENDED FOR READERS 18 AND OLDER DUE TO STRONG LANGUAGE, SEXUAL SITUATIONS AND VIOLENCE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 of 3 in the Nine Minutes Trilogy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Gift of Time is the third installment in the Nine Minutes Trilogy. It is not intended to be a stand-alone novel, but could be read as one. Still, I highly recommend that you read my first two novels, Nine Minutes and Out of Time, to be able to understand the background stories of the main characters. There are many twists and turns in both books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are some secrets meant to stay buried? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three months have passed since Jason “Grizz” Talbot was put to death by lethal injection for crimes he committed. His former wife, Ginny, whom he had abducted from a convenience store when she was a teenager and became the love obsession of his life, has spent more than the last decade trying to carve out a life of normalcy in the bustling suburbs of Fort Lauderdale—including a thriving and happy marriage to Tommy "Grunt" Dillon, a former member of Grizz’s gang. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tired of the secrets and the lies, Ginny and Tommy thought the final piece of their past could be left behind forever with Grizz’s execution. However, the past comes crashing around Ginny and Tommy when a newly discovered secret threatens to destroy their marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When tragedy strikes, Ginny is forced to reach into her heart and decide, once and for all, what she really wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this third book in the Nine Minutes trilogy, A Gift of Time takes readers from the busy tropical metropolis of South Florida into the serenity of the North Carolina Blue Ridge mountains as Ginny chases down the answers she needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she have the strength to confront the secrets of her past…and her heart?</description>

  <description>RECOMMENDED FOR READERS 18 AND OLDER DUE TO &lt;br /&gt;STRONG LANGUAGE, SEXUAL SITUATIONS AND VIOLENCE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Out of Time is book two in a series. It is not a standalone novel. I highly recommend that you read my first novel, Nine Minutes, to be able to understand the background stories of the main characters. There are many twists and turns in both books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I do answer the outstanding questions from Nine Minutes, there is more to this story, and some readers may consider it a cliffhanger. If you do not like cliffhangers, you may want to wait until the third novel is released in 2016. Other readers may be satisfied with the answers and the ending. Regardless of which category you fall into, I hope you enjoy the story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They thought with his execution it would all be over. &lt;br /&gt;They were wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The leader of one of South Florida’s most notorious and brutal motorcycle gangs has been put to death by lethal injection. Days later, his family and friends should have been picking up the pieces, moving on. Instead, they’ve been catapulted into a world so twisted and dangerous even the most ruthless among them would be stunned to discover the tangled web of deception, not only on the dangerous streets of South Florida but all the way to the top. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this gripping follow-up novel to Nine Minutes, Out of Time takes readers from the sun-drenched flatlands of 1950s Central Florida to the vivid tropical heat of Fort Lauderdale to the halls of Florida’s Death Row as we finally learn the gritty backstory of Jason “Grizz” Talbot and the secret he spent his life trying to conceal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not even Grizz’s inner circle knows his full story—the tragedy that enveloped his early life, the surprise discovery that made him the government’s most wanted and most feared, and the depths of his love for Ginny, the tenderhearted innocent he’d once abducted and later made his wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once Grizz’s obsession and now the mother of his child, Ginny has spent years grieving the man she’d first resisted and then came to love. Now remarried to Tommy, a former member of the gang, the pair have spent more than a decade trying desperately to live a normal existence far from the violent, crime-ridden world they’d once carved out on the edge of the Florida Everglades. For Tommy, especially, the stakes are high. Desperately in love with Ginny for years, he’s finally living his dream: married to the woman he never thought he could have. But even with the façade of normalcy—thriving careers, two beautiful children, and a genuinely happy and loving marriage—they can’t seem to put the past behind them. Every time they turn around, another secret is revealed, unraveling the very bonds that hold them together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And with Grizz finally put to death, now Ginny has learned secrets so dark, so evil she’s not even sure she can go on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will these secrets tear their love to pieces? And how far will Grizz go to protect what he still considers his, even from beyond the grave?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22839067-nine-minutes" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 15, 1975, fifteen-year-old Ginny Lemon is abducted from a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale by a member of one of the most notorious and brutal motorcycle gangs in South Florida. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that moment on, her life is forever changed. She gets a new name, a new identity and a new life in the midst of the gang’s base on the edge of the Florida Everglades—a frightening, rough and violent world much like the swamps themselves, where everyone has an alias and loyalty is tantamount to survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And at the center of it all is the gang’s leader, Grizz: massive, ruggedly handsome, terrifying and somehow, when it comes to Ginny, tender. She becomes his obsession and the one true love of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So begins a tale of emotional obsession and manipulation, of a young woman ripped from everything she knows and forced to lean on the one person who provides attention, affection and care: her captor. Precocious and intelligent, but still very much a teenager, Ginny struggles to adapt to her existence, initially fighting and then coming to terms with her captivity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she be rescued? Will she escape? Will she get out alive—or get out at all? Part psychological thriller, part coming-of-age novel, filled with mystery, romance and unexpected turns, Nine Minutes takes readers into the world of one motorcycle gang and inside the heart of a young girl, whose abduction brought about its fall.</description>

  <description>Dr. Lila Emerson is finally free of the shadow of her politically connected family, with her new job in a small town Emergency Room. But her new peace is shattered when she encounters the dangerous, but compelling Striker. He's everything she should stay away from, but all she craves. And since he keeps turning up in her ER, he's hard to avoid.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Vice President of No Prisoners outlaw motorcycle club, Striker is no stranger to violence. But when it touches the pretty doctor he wants in his bed, he'll do anything to keep her safe. When Striker and Lila are thrust together, sparks fly and passions ignite. Before long they find themselves entangled in a relationship neither saw coming.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The MC can and will eliminate any threat against Lila, but what if they—and the man she's falling for—are the reason she’s in danger?</description>

  <description>As the VP of Kings of Retribution MC, I live and breathe this life. After suffering the loss of two women in my life, I grew cold and indifferent to the idea of love. I don't need to let anyone in. I've seen the aftermath it can leave in its quake. &lt;br /&gt;The last thing I'm looking for is someone to fill the void. &lt;br /&gt;Until-- Bella Jameson &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to keep my head above water, my only concern is taking care of my sister. The last ting I expected was to fall in love with a tattooed biker, Logan Kane. With evil hiding in the shadows, I have no idea the danger my sister and I are about to face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will they overcome their demons in the end, or will they lose each other in the process? Lies will be told, secrets will be revealed, and what was once lost... will be found.</description>

  <description>The funny thing about fate—about life, is you never know what the next day holds. Live with no regrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quinn Beckett, Sergeant At Arms for the Kings of Retribution MC knows life is all about what you make of it. He has dedicated years to his club, his family, his community and the members he calls his brothers. For Quinn, he couldn’t imagine life getting much better. &lt;br /&gt;Until a chance meeting a couple of years ago with a bright, attractive doctor altered his course in life. She became his only desire—his obsession. &lt;br /&gt;Quinn wanted nothing more than to make Emerson his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To outsiders Emerson Evans had all the things in life you could ever hope for; family, friends and a great career, but what they didn’t know was she wasn’t happy. All her life she chased dreams—dreams that were only partly her own. Being a doctor means everything to her, but she finds herself longing for more out of life. &lt;br /&gt;Including wanting a sexy, long-haired biker, who happens to be part of the local MC. &lt;br /&gt;The very Club that fate decided was to be a part of her life. &lt;br /&gt;She could never have foreseen that giving her heart away and loving a man so fiercely would be the source of strength she would lean on when the unexpected happens. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Abel LeBlanc, better known to his brothers as Riggs — President for The Kings of Retribution MC, Louisiana Chapter. As a former Green Beret, he runs the club with the same amount of precision and grit he did serving his country. &lt;br /&gt;Dedicating years of his life to mercenary missions, and to his club left no time or desire to settle down and start a family of his own. What good could come of loving a woman if he could never promise her forever when he willingly puts his life on the line every day. &lt;br /&gt;No one has ever come close to making him want more. No one until Luna. &lt;br /&gt;A call from Jake; President and founder of The Kings of Retribution has Riggs and his men on the road toward Montana. Their objective — protect a woman from falling into the hands of another MC. &lt;br /&gt;Little did he know when his eyes fell upon the striking woman with violet eyes, she would alter his life forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up in the system is hard enough for any kid. For Luna Novak, not being able to hear the world around her made surviving in it the most terrifying and isolating experience of her life. &lt;br /&gt;Though she doesn't have much, Luna feels she has finally gotten to a point in her life where her future doesn’t look so grim. That is until she makes the mistake of putting her trust in the hands of the wrong man — almost costing Luna her life. &lt;br /&gt;For Luna to protect herself and survive, she must leave Arizona behind for a new life in Polson. When her past follows her, threatening the lives of those around her, Luna soon finds herself under the protection of the local MC. &lt;br /&gt;Leaving with Riggs and going back to Louisiana with him becomes her only choice. Her heart tells her Riggs will keep her safe, yet fear screams for her to run. &lt;br /&gt;The pull she feels toward Riggs is stronger than any feeling she has felt before, but can she put her trust and her life in the hands of another man so quickly?</description>

  <description>January 2018&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy Gaines has loved one man in her lifetime. After fifteen years of marriage and three kids, reality hasn’t changed that—but sometimes love isn’t enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West “Camo” Gaines has never wanted anyone the way he wants his wife, but the Notorious Devils’ club life has opened his eyes and awakened a desire he knows he can’t explore with the mother of his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lies, misunderstanding, betrayal and silence are the bitter pills they swallow daily as the marriage they thought would last forever begins to unravel. It isn’t until club rivalries threaten to shatter their entire world that they realize how much they have to fight for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When things get rough and real, they’re forced to remember just how deep their love goes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Recommended for readers 18+ due to, Language, Violence, and Sexual Content.</description>

  <description>Cleo Hill is a married woman, in love with a man she's never really known—her husband, whom she hasn't seen in eleven years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Paxton "Torch" Hill is a Notorious Devil, a man who's been wrestling with his personal demons since before he knew the horrors of war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a threat against his club means danger could be lurking around his estranged wife's door, Paxton is determined to protect her. Yet, one look at the woman he left behind, and he knows his plans are about to change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The past is not an easy thing to forget, especially not for a woman scorned. While Cleo isn't the innocent catch he once knew, there's something about that rough and ready man she's not sure she can deny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all—they promised each other forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Sexual Content, and Violence</description>

I didn’t like Pax’s ways I was so worried once things got tough he was gonna run to the club whores again. There was a lot more suspense in this one compared to the others.

  <description>Mary-Ann Lukin has never had it easy. Having survived the torments of abuse for far too long, it's a miracle that life somehow managed to leave her with a little bit of hope—hope of a future filled with happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Max "MadDog" Duhart has lived more than one lifetime, earning the respect he's due as the president of the Original Charter of Notorious Devils. Nevertheless, with life still yet to live, he wants more than the regret that's tarnished his past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their connection is instant, though they know they shouldn't act on it—not with more than thirty years between them. Not with their families tied together by the club's brotherhood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, there's something about the sweet, broken woman that whispers of a fresh start for an old man. And while he may be rough and ruthless, she cannot deny the way she feels when she looks into his haunted blue eyes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One phone call. One cry for help. One motorcycle ride, and life as they know it is never the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;** Recommended for readers 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual content</description>

  <description>Hattie Morris is a young girl with silly dreams and a fantasy she's been holding onto since she was sixteen years old. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Dirty" Johnny Williams is a hard man who rides as a Notorious Devil, known for being filthy between the sheets, yet always wishing for the unattainable more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night, one kiss sets fate in motion, and neither Hattie, nor Johnny, can deny that their lives have been forever changed. Time and distance stand between them, but a chance encounter shatters their ability to resist each other any longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's not long before Hattie realizes that fantasies are named thus for a reason, while Johnny learns that the innocence of a sweet girl is no match against his hardened heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, inexperienced as she may be, Hattie knows one thing for sure. If she doesn't take a chance with this rough and rugged man, she'll never know if dreams really can come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Sexual Content, and Violence.</description>

  <description>Brentlee Johnson-Corbin has always followed her mother's rules, even when it meant marrying a man she knew wasn't her happily-ever-after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bates "Sniper" Lukin, a retired marine, now rides with the Notorious Devils—his street name earned in the deserts of hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the most precious part of Brentlee's world is threatened by the man who was meant to love them, she escapes to the only safe place she knows. But when she seeks the shelter of her sister, Kentlee, and her husband, Fury, her past steps in—and he's determined to protect Brentlee and her daughter as his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their story is one of love discarded, but Sniper won't waste this opportunity to right the wrongs of his past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life has been cruel to them both, and Brentlee is certain that the love they lost is gone forever; but under his protective wing, she can't deny that this rough and raw man might be just the hope she needs &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-- Series Standalone with Interconnected Characters-- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Recommended for readers 18+ due to Sexual Content, Language, and Violence.</description>

Loving this series it isn’t too dark like a lot of other MC books. Can’t wait to see what’s to come!! Dirty Johnny is next and I’m EXCITED!! 🤤 ]]>

  <description>Kentlee Johnson has always been a sweet girl with good intentions and simple dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pierce "Fury" Duhart is an outlaw by nature, born and bred to ride with the Notorious Devils. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a chance encounter brings them face to face, Kentlee knows that getting involved with the president of the town's notorious MC is not a wise choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Fury knows what he wants, and Kentlee is the little bit of sugar he craves on the side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daring to be bold for just one night, Kentlee surrenders to Fury's advances—but one taste of the rough and rowdy man is all it takes to turn her world upside down. &lt;br /&gt;*** Recommended for 18+ due to Sexual Content, Adult Language, and Violence</description>

  <description>(Book 2 in the A Stolen Melody Duet - Get Book 1 for only 99Cents, limited time!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He stole her lyrics, and then he stole her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lyric Cassidy is off the tour, lost as to what her next career move will be, and certain that she’ll never love again after Wolf. All because of a social media scandal that left her with no choice but to pack up and face the consequences. When she learns that the fate of her career is in her hands, she has a difficult decision to make. Step back on the tour bus with Wolf and deal with the mess she left behind, or end her contract early and lose her job at Perform Live? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wolf’s shattered heart finds no resolve in giving Lyric a chance to come back on tour. He can never be with her again. Not after she walked away. Conflicted with wants and needs, he struggles to remember who Wolf was before Lyric. That’s what he needs to become again. Maybe then his heart will be safe. Or maybe there’s no hope for the damaged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with stolen dreams, betrayals, and terrifying threats—no one’s heart is safe. Not even the ones that may be destined to be together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Reluctant cheerleader Dallas Bryan has a problem on her hands—and his name is Drayton Lahey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the hot star quarterback of the high school football team hit her car with his motorcycle, he has the annoying ability to get under her skin, making Dallas think about Drayton way more than she should . . . in all the ways that she shouldn't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dallas has one goal—to pursue her dance-school dreams in in California—and no one, not even a hard-bodied, green-eyed football god, will stop her. As the tension between Drayton and Dallas grows thicker, the lines are getting blurred, and all she wants is to come undone under his touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing between Dallas and Drayton could cost her her dreams . . . if he doesn't break her heart first.</description>

I’m not usually a big fan of YA because I like more steam. But even those this book lacked it I truly enjoyed it. Both characters were loveable. At times I felt like they were ol...]]>

  <description>His heart beats for the music. She's his favorite song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyric Cassidy knows a thing or two about bad boy rock stars with raspy vocals. In fact, her heart was just played by one. So when she takes an assignment as road manager for the world famous rock star, Wolf, she's prepared to take him on, full suit of heart-armor intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf is the sexy lead singer for the hottest rock band around with a line-up of guaranteed one night stands. Lyric Cassidy isn't one of them. That's fine with him. Women like Lyric come with fairytale expectations, so it should be easy to stay away. Too bad she's hot as sin with a fiery temper and a mouth that drives him wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's also got something to hide. Something he discovers. Something he wants ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing a tour bus, neither of them are prepared for the miles of road ahead and the fierce attraction they feel toward one another--a dangerous combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Authors Note: Dangerous Hearts has been rewritten from the original Dangerous Hearts, formally published under Mia McAdams.)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>He needs someone to work with his son, she needs a job. They need to keep their hands to themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Seattle, the Emerald City and home to The Single Dads of Seattle. Ten sexy single fathers who play poker every Saturday night, have each other’s backs, love their children without quarter, and hope to one day find love again. &lt;br /&gt;This is Mark's story … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single Dad of Seattle Dr. Mark Herron can’t believe anyone would celebrate their divorce. The dissolution of his marriage left him and his son with a huge hole to fill in their home—and their hearts. So when he overhears a lovely stranger and her friends celebrating the end of her marriage, he’s mystified—and then intrigued—by her determination to put the past behind her. But when he learns that Tori Jones needs a job, he knows this can’t be a coincidence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tori might be telling the world nothing’s got her down, but the truth is she’s hit rock bottom. Her husband didn’t just cheat on her, he took all her money, including her college fund, which means her marriage is over, and so is her dream to go to grad school and help children with special needs. So when a handsome stranger offers her a job caring for his special needs son, she knows she can’t turn it down— &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if what she’s feeling for Mark is far from professional. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Mark’s finding it hard to keep his hands to himself and Tori’s struggling to keep her thoughts from straying to dangerous territory. Will they be able to keep their distance from each other or will being hired by the sexy single dad be Tori’s biggest problem of all?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The sequel to the wildly popular romantic comedy SINGLE DAD ON TOP has arrived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bride-to-be Arianna wants to meet my parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...they live in a trailer. Dad thinks Playboy T-shirts are classy because the naked women are silhouettes. Mom has a tattoo of a dog humping a palm tree. I don't think either one has said a sentence without an f-bomb since 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my name a long time ago. Started a new life with a clean slate and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know how to mend that bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or why there's a pig-on-a-spit at their surprise engagement party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or how Arianna and I ended up wearing matching "Ball and Chain" bride and groom shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you don't get to choose your parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in my family, crazy is definitely &lt;i&gt;relative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___&lt;br /&gt;While Single Dad Plus One could probably stand alone, a lot of the humor builds on book one, Single Dad on Top. We recommend reading them in order.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new single dad romantic comedy from the author of the USA Today bestselling single dad series &lt;i&gt;Fight for Her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm always on top. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My penthouse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My corporate office above Manhattan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, of course, the women in my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Actually, I might choose any position. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But make no mistake. I choose. I control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My life is mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is why I'm not sure what the hell is going on when I open my front door and there's a baby stroller sitting in my private hall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The note on the infant simply says, "Do the DNA. She's yours." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, damn.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;_____ &lt;br /&gt;Full length (395 print pages, 72,000 words) standalone HEA. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Contains all the crazy elements of a billionaire alpha male meets virgin next door for a fake marriage leading to a love affair that involves royalty -- all while laughing over his inability to understand baby basics! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Includes a sneak peek of Fight for Her.</description>

  <description>This is a companion prequel short story to &lt;i&gt;Cruel Intentions&lt;/i&gt;. Only available via a link in the back of CI. This book will not be published on Amazon or any other retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it's a prequel story it gives spoilers to the main story hence why it is listed as #1.5 in the series as it should only be read AFTER reading Cruel Intentions.</description>

  <description>He thinks he’s broken me. That I’m finally under his complete control. But I’m biding my time, gathering intel, making plans, and waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. So, when an unexpected savior appears—offering me a way out—I grasp it with both hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the man I love refuses to let me go, and he’s hell-bent on protecting me at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except he’s far too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaiden’s betrayal fuels the anger flowing through my veins, and now our roles are reversed—I’m the hunter, and he’s my prey. I enjoy torturing him, lying to him, and letting him believe in false truths that were never our reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the stakes are raised, and I’m forced into playing their game again. Only this time, it’s not just my life hanging in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought he’d done his worst. That he didn’t have the power to hurt me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His depravity knows no bounds, and now, he’s taken everything from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, it means war, and I’m taking no prisoners.</description>

  <description>When I was fifteen, a single bullet changed my life. I spent the next decade trying to outrun the devastation of my past, building an empire that would shield me from whatever life could throw at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all the money in the world couldn’t help me when I found a screaming newborn abandoned on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d never wanted to be a father. Passing the sludge that ran through my veins down to an innocent child seemed like a tragedy. But there she was—pink cheeks, red hair, and mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, against all logic, that little girl became the best thing that ever happened to me. It was impossible to stay lost in the past when I was the only one who could protect her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is exactly why, when her mother came back four years later, I was ready for battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I could stop myself from falling in love with her during the war.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;In the power struggle between two elite groups, one feisty girl will bring them to their knees…&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is a cruel game where only the most ruthless survive. It’s a truth my mother rebelled against, and she paid for it with her life. Now, I play &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; game. Publicly accepting the destiny that lies in wait for me when I turn eighteen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, behind closed doors, I plot my escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trent, Charlie, and my twin, Drew, rule the hallways of Rydeville High with arrogance and an iron fist. I execute my role perfectly, hating every second, but they never let me forget my place in this world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone obeys the rules. They have for generations. Because our families have always been in control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Cam, Sawyer, and Jackson show up. Throwing their new money around. Challenging the status quo. Setting hearts racing with their gorgeous faces, hot bodies, and bad boy attitudes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battle lines are drawn. Sides are taken. And I’m trapped in the middle, because I made a mistake one fateful night when I gave my V-card to a stranger in a blatant F you to my fiancé. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought it was the one thing I owned. A precious memory to carry me through each dark day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t have been more wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because the stranger was Camden Marshall, leader of the new elite and my perpetual tormenter. He hates me with a passion unrivaled, and he won’t be the only one. Fire will rain down if the truth is revealed, threatening alliances, and the power struggle will turn vicious. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My life will hang in the balance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I’ll be ready, and I’m not going down without a fight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Due to mature content and themes this book is recommended to readers eighteen and over.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Remember us...when I can't.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea Hughes has five minutes to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A car accident stole her parents and left her with the second-worst documented case of amnesia in the world. She now has only minutes of experiences, of consciousness, of life…before her memory is wiped clean. The once effervescent artist with a promising future is reduced to scribbling with pens and paper, living an empty, quiet life, three hundred seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Whelan is on autopilot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A foster kid shuffled around the system since birth, he’s lived his entire life without knowing love…and it’s taken its toll—until he learned to fight back, carry his armor, and keep his head down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working as an orderly in the Blue Ridge Sanitarium, deep in Virginia countryside, Jim looked up…and found Thea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Thea has the chance to break free of her five-minute prison with a risky, experimental surgery, it could lead them both to an epic love they never thought possible… or one that could require the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;50 First Dates&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Awakenings&lt;/i&gt; in this emotional love story by international and best selling author, Emma Scott. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's one of the best books I've ever read."--&lt;b&gt;T.M.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never again would I allow my heart to become the plaything of someone else. &lt;br /&gt;Never again would I let a man (or men) come between me and my goals. &lt;br /&gt;Never again would I love without feeling the fullness of that love in return. &lt;br /&gt;Not until I knew it was real. And if that took me a lifetime to find, so be it.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those were my vows, and after all that had happened with Connor and Weston, I was determined to keep them. To protect my heart. &lt;br /&gt;And then he came home, and my vows became his promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He held my heart in his hands with reverence and care. &lt;br /&gt;He helped me find my soul’s greatest purpose in life. &lt;br /&gt;He loved me with a love so pure and vibrant, I knew I’d never feel anything like it in a hundred lifetimes. &lt;br /&gt;It was real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it wasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;Until it all came crashing down when I discovered the deep love I thought I’d found was nestled in a web of lies—so soft and silken I hadn’t noticed it was there.&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;Long Live the Beautiful Hearts is the emotional, heart-wrenching conclusion to the Beautiful Hearts Duet by bestselling author, Emma Scott, and is inspired by the classic tale, Cyrano de Bergerac. (Roxanne) THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOVE TRIANGLE #confusedhearts #notamenage &lt;br /&gt;THIS BOOK IS NOT A STANDALONE. It should not be read without first reading &lt;i&gt;Bring Down the Stars&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I fell for Connor Drake. I didn’t want to; I fought against it, but I fell in love with him anyway. With his words. With his poetry. With him. The gentleness and beauty of his soul that speaks directly to mine. He writes as if he can feel my heart, hear its cadence and compose the exact right lyrics to accompany every beat and flow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m in love with Connor…so why do I feel an inexplicable pull to his best friend, Weston? Grouchy, sullen, brooding Weston Turner, who could cut you down with a look. Fiercely intelligent with a razor sharp wit and acid tongue, he’s the exact opposite of Connor in every way, and yet there’s electricity in the air between us. The thorny barbs Weston wraps around himself can’t keep me away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the more time I spend with these men, the more tangled and confused my emotions become. When they both sign up for the Army Reserves during a time of increasing strife in the Middle East, I fear I’ll never unravel my own heart that sometimes feels as if it will tear straight down the middle…for both of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bring Down the Stars&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional, angst-filled novel of unrequited love by bestselling author, Emma Scott, and is inspired by the classic tale, &lt;i&gt;Cyrano de Bergerac.&lt;/i&gt; (Roxanne) It is Book I in the Beautiful Hearts Duet, coming this summer. Book II, &lt;i&gt;Long Live the Beautiful Hearts&lt;/i&gt;, to be released a few weeks later. THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOVE TRIANGLE #confusedhearts #notamenage</description>

  <description>When we were eleven, Oliver Ford Pemberton dared me to jump off a barn roof. He said you couldn’t break a leg from a 12-foot-jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You can also break a collarbone, which served him right as far as I was concerned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say it was the last dare I ever took from him, the last bet I ever made with him, the last time I ever trusted Oliver Ford Pemberton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he had the nerve to grow up gorgeous, charming, and sexy. And as we got older, the dares only got dirtier—and the betting stakes higher—until finally, he left me in pieces. I swore I’d never talk to him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But twenty years after I took that flying leap, he’s back in my life, daring me to risk everything for him: my job, my self-worth, and my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many chances does love deserve?</description>

  <description>Kamdyn Ellis is the man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. All-Star athlete and resident bad boy. #7 quarterback on the field, and #1 player off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every guy at school wants to be him, and every girl at school wants to date him. Well, except Laney Summers that is. The sassy city girl is the only one immune to Kam’s clear blue eyes and arsenal of southern charm. But when a debilitating injury sidelines Kam’s future and ability to play football, it’s Laney who is tasked to be his tutor while he recuperates at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between Kam and Laney is undeniable, and after months of ignoring what’s clearly evident, Laney gives in. Allowing herself one night with Kam, no strings attached, no commitment to speak of. Alone, under the stars, on the fifty-yard line, Kam and Laney set out to discover if what they have is real, or just one steamy southern night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Southern Nights Series&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of three novellas following the story of Kam and Laney, an all-star football player destined for greatness and the sassy city girl who challenges him on every level. This collection is steamy, fun, flirty and full of heart! &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;So wrong it's right…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grumpy firefighter Leo finally answers the wrong number text he's been getting for several days, he has no idea pixels on a screen could be so hot—or make him want things he's never wanted before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixie has always been quiet, shy, and reserved. Until she "meets" Leo. He's got the once shy librarian shedding her inhibitions and growing her confidence in their texts and calls—and it even starts spilling out into her everyday life. Part of her revels in her secret life—but part of her secretly wishes for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They never share more than first names, but each texting encounter gets hotter and hotter—and more intimate than either of them ever imagined. But you can't trust a stranger on the phone. Not really. You can't ache for something you've never had. And you certainly can't fall in love with someone you've never even met, can you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Author Confession: Welcome to Brazen Bay, a small town I crafted just to explore that feeling of &lt;em&gt;so wrong it's righ&lt;/em&gt;t. Just because something is forbidden or taboo doesn't make it wrong, does it? (You'd have to see the pictures on their phones to answer that.) Gruff Leo and sweet Dixie are perfect strangers and perfectly naughty when they let their guards down with someone for the first time. What starts as an innocent wrong number turns into something much more daring. Bonus points if you read this wrong number romance on your phone.&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could you love a man surrounded by danger?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigi Gallo’s childhood was filled with the roar of a motorcycle and the hum of a tattoo gun. Fresh out of college, she’s about to start working at her family’s tattoo studio — Inked. But when she shows up the first day, she never expects to run into someone tall, dark, and totally sexy from her not-so-innocent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pike Moore is a bossy biker with a cocky attitude and an even bigger ego. He came to Inked to start over. New town. New job. New roots. None of that included coming face-to-face with the hot chick who spent a week in his bed before she vanished without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Pike’s dark family history catches up with him, can he stop Gigi from being caught in the crossfire?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame is book one in the Men of Inked: Heatwave series by USA Today bestselling author Chelle Bliss. The Men of Inked: Heatwave series features steamy romance, hot heroes, and strong women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**City &amp;amp; Suzy's Daughter**</description>

  <description> Have my baby.   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;That was what my single dad best friend Seth said to me while I was waitressing at the diner.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;His little girl wants a sibling. But Seth is a workaholic millionaire and doesn't have time to meet someone. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Someone who won't screw him over, like his kid's mother.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Only problem is this someone has secretly been in love with him since high school. I've been hiding it forever, not wanting to risk our friendship. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Sleeping with him is my biggest fantasy. And I've fantasized plenty, being a virgin. Another thing he doesn't know. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Now I have to make the biggest decision of my life. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Is having a no strings attached affair just to make a baby better than never having him at all? &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Author’s note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;this case of insta-love and insta-naked-time has been brewing for over a decade. Babymaking has never been so hot…or so funny…or so complicated.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When wilderness guide, Harper Ward, is summoned to the small town sheriff’s office in Helena Springs, Montana, to provide assistance on a case, she is shocked to find that their only suspect in the double murder investigation is a man described as a savage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the longer she watches the man known only as Lucas, on the station surveillance camera, the more intrigued she becomes. He certainly looks primitive with his unkempt appearance and animal skin attire, but she also sees intelligence in his eyes, sensitivity in his expression. Who is he? And how is it possible that he’s lived alone in the forest since he was a small child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets begin to emerge, Harper is thrust into something bigger and more diabolical than she ever could have imagined. And standing right at the center of it all, is Lucas. But is he truly the wild man he appears to be? A cold blooded killer? An innocent victim? Or a perplexing mix of all three?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper must find out the answers to these questions because the more time she spends with him, the more she risks losing her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannah Stewart knows what she likes, and it doesn't include relationships. She has enough on her plate with her fledgling adult novelty shop, Yes Please. But even with an arsenal of sex toys at her disposal, she's hit a dry spell—one she wishes the sexy Mitchell Fredericks would help her out with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's just one snag. His sexy roommate and business partner, Ben Harrington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing she wants to do is come between their friendship—even though she'd like to come between them in other ways. Instead, she comes up with a proposition for them, one that might lead to a very hot, very unexpected outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Every little girl dreams of the fairytale. The one where the white knight rushes in to save her from the clutches of evil. They fall in love, have babies, and live happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By that definition, my life should have been a fairytale too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I was eight years old, Caven Hunt saved me from the worst kind of evil to walk the Earth. It didn’t matter that I was a kid. I fell in love with him all the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But that was where my fairytale ended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Years later, a one-night stand during the darkest time imaginable gave us a little girl. It was nothing compared to the pitch black that consumed me when I was forced to leave her with Caven for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the end of every fairytale, the happily-ever-after is the one thing that remains consistent. It wasn’t going to be mine, but there hadn’t been a night that passed where I hadn’t prayed that it would be hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I owed Caven my life. &lt;br /&gt;However, I owed that innocent child more. &lt;br /&gt;And that included ripping the heart from my chest and facing her father again.</description>

  <description>Abby Burke put her wild days behind her, determined to be the adult she thought she needed to be. It was just a phase, right? But when her college reunion reveals her...adventurous...past to her straitlaced gentleman of a husband, Abby is terrified he’ll reject her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Sam is more than intrigued by what has his normally bold wife flushing with embarrassment…and desire. So when he and Abby stumble onto an especially hot scene that takes them over the edge, he proposes a challenge: confess their deepest fantasies and fulfill them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their playful explorations escalate, their forays into exhibitionism and kink shift the way they see each other and their relationship—for the better. But when Sam finds himself longing to see her pleasured by other men, and Abby’s all in, they wonder if this will make their marriage stronger or end up tearing them apart.</description>

  <description>Avery's emotions are fried, but she doesn't have to think twice about her BFFs Marty and Mel. They mean everything to her. They're the family she doesn't have. In a crisis, they're the people to have by her side, and God knows this is a crisis. Friends like that are worth their weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only things with Sean were so simple. Regret is something that is impossible to subdue. There are still things to be said, things to do. Life is too short to live in the past, but when Avery wakes up at the hospital she finds that her world has changed.</description>

  <description>Sex isn’t love, but it feels like it–that is until Sean bolts from the room. For a moment, everything seemed fine. Avery’s life didn’t feel so impossible. She got the guy and the money, but then everything shifts. The line between reality and fantasy gets hazy. It’s impossible to know if her feelings are genuine or just an illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse something from Sean’s past surfaces. Devastated, Avery realizes that Sean isn’t the guy that she thought he was. Avery’s heart can’t take another loss and this time, it looks like she’s going to lose everything.</description>

  <description>From Audie Award winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Kylie Scott comes an irresistible new romance - available in audio first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a vicious attack leaves 25-year-old Clementine Johns with no memory, she's forced to start over. Now she has to figure out who she was and why she made the choices she did - which includes leaving the supposed love of her life, tattoo artist Ed Larsen, only a month before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed can hardly believe it when his ex shows up at his tattoo parlor with no memory of their past, asking about the breakup that nearly destroyed him. The last thing he needs is more heartache, but he can't seem to let her go again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should they walk away for good, or does their love deserve a repeat performance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 6 hours and 47 minutes&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE SERIES WITH OVER A MILLION COPIES SOLD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Volume 1 in the bestselling Arrangement Serials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genre: New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FML is becoming Avery's motto. Just when she doesn't think things could get any worse, they do. When her car stalls out at a busy intersection and she gets out to check under the hood, a guy steals her car. Armed with a dress and a pair of Chucks, Avery runs after the thief. When a hot stranger offers to help, she can't say no. That's how Avery meets Sean Ferro, the totally sexy, totally damaged guy with more secrets than she has time for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery doesn't have time for anything anymore. Her is life falling apart and it's not just the car. It's everything, and it doesn't matter how tightly she tries to hold on, there's nothing left to hold on to. With the sudden death of her parents, it's only a matter of months until Avery's shot at college is gone, and she's living in a cardboard box. Other students have their families to rely on when things get bad. Avery has no one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's one option, one incredibly sexy, morally devoid, option. If Avery takes a job as a call girl, one guy could save her. One client. One time. She just has to say yes.</description>

  <description>CHASE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I saw Aimee Gilpin walk into a bar, it was love at first sight. She looks nothing like the women I usually go for, and everything like the woman I’d want to come home to every night. Then my best friend showed up and I had to let him pursue her. It was the right thing to do as a friend and business partner, but the wrong thing to do for my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I see Aimee walk into a bar, she has finally convinced my friend that she isn’t interested, and I was planning on drinking myself into oblivion to avoid calling her. She probably thinks I hate her. I tried to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow I’ll deal with my best friend and the company we built with his money and my brains.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, she’s mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AIMEE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I saw Chase McKay at a bar, I thought I’d met the man of my dreams—I just didn’t recall the man of my dreams looking like the lead singer of a grunge band. Then as soon his friend showed up, Chase bolted like I was his worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I see him in a bar, I can tell by the look in his eyes that we both regret his choice that first night. He has no idea that I just started working for the company that their company is about to start working with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t want to make things any more complicated than they already are, but I do want him like nobody’s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we’ll deal with the fact that Chase, his best friend and I will be working together.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, he’s mine.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Four stars</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed this book. This is the first book I’ve read by this author and I can say she is now on my radar. I won’t lie to me it was kind of slow at the beginning but once it started going it was so great. And can we talk about that cover?? I mean WOW 😍😍😍 ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The world’s sexiest firefighter is about to get a second chance with the virgin next door…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s bossy, arrogant, and so ridiculously hot he should come with a warning label and a pair of flame retardant coveralls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also the boy who broke my heart when we were in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to move in next door to Ryan O’Dell the way I want to be the virgin gamer geek suddenly in charge of running my sister’s sex toy factory. Too bad both are written in my stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I’m the world’s oldest virgin code-writing nerd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s the world’s hottest firefighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even though he intimidates the heck out of me, I can’t seem to control my libido when he’s around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is my dignity? My self-respect? My panties?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously…. Have you seen them? Anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they’re hiding in his bedroom. With my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know. I’m hosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hosed&lt;/i&gt; is a steamy, fun romantic comedy between a firefighter and the virgin nerd next door, complete with a pet raccoon, scandalous gossip, and dildo football. (No, really.) This romance has no cheating or cliffhangers, and ends with a banging hot happily ever after.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From NYT Bestseller Corinne Michaels &amp;amp; USA Today Bestseller Melanie Harlow, comes a sexy friends to lovers standalone romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rule number one for a professional matchmaker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t fall in love with your client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I screwed that up when I fell for my best friend, Reid Fortino. He’s gorgeous, successful, and sexy as hell. I figured it would be easy to find him a match—and save the family business at the same time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the more time I spend attempting to find the perfect girl, the more I realize how much I want him for my own. What’s the harm if we give in for just one night?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should have known that would never be enough.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I’m on the verge of losing my job and my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were an imperfect match from the start, but I don’t know how to let him go.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New Adult sensation and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Until You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madoc and Fallon. Two estranged teenagers playing games that push the boundaries between love and war…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the two years she’s been away at boarding school, there was no word from her. Back when we lived in the same house, she used to cut me down during the day and then leave her door open for me at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stupid then, but now I’m ready to beat her at her own game…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years and I can tell he still wants me, even if he acts like he’s better than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t be scared away. Or pushed down. I’ll call his bluff and fight back. That’s what he wants, right? As long as I keep my guard up, he’ll never know how much he affects me….</description>

  <description>***This novel contains graphic sexual content and harsh language. It is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been so angry that hitting things felt good? Or so numb that you actually felt high? The past few years have been like that for me. Traveling between fury and indifference with no stops in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people hate me for it, while others are scared of me. But none of them can hurt me, because I don't care about anything or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Tatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love her so much that I hate her. We used to be friends, but I found out that I couldn't trust her or anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hurt her. I pushed her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still need her. The sight of her centers me, and I can pool all of my anger into her. Engaging her, challenging her, bullying her...they are my food, my air, and the last part of me that feels anything human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she left. She went to France for a year, and came back a different girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I push, she pushes back.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36654355-bully" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Penelope Douglas delivers an unforgettable New Adult romance that toes the fine line between love and hate…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Tate. He doesn't call me that, though. He’ll barely refer to me at all, and he’ll hardly ever speak to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he still won't leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were best friends once. Then he turned on me and made it his mission to ruin my life. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got worse as time wore on. I even went to Europe for a year, just to avoid him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm done hiding from him now, and there's no way I'll allow him to ruin another year. He might not have changed, but I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time to fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When one brave young woman stands up to her best friend Jared, now tormenter, the consequences go beyond anything either of them ever would have imagined…&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Maxon Chambers has a way of stealing all the attention. &lt;br /&gt;All my affection, and all my dreams. &lt;br /&gt;What I needed to remember was he’d stolen my good judgment and my virginity, too. &lt;br /&gt;When he broke up with me, I ran across the country and swore I’d never return to Broadshire Rim. &lt;br /&gt;But here I am, thirteen years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxon is all grown up.&lt;br /&gt;Sexier than sin and more tempting than ever. &lt;br /&gt;A detective on the Charleston force, he lives on the outside of safety, devoted to protecting the people of his city.&lt;br /&gt;But with the way he’s looking at me now? I’m pretty sure what needs protecting is my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we mend the pieces of us? Or will he leave my heart shattered forever . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The newest novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Emma Chase.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Head of the class...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garrett Daniels has this whole life thing figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocky, charismatic former high school star quarterback is an idolized football coach and "cool" teacher in the hometown where he's not just a golden boy — he's platinum. He has good friends, a great house on the lake, and the best damn sidekick a man could ask for: Snoopy, the albino beagle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then...Callie Carpenter comes home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And knocks him right on his tight end zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back to school...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callie has a pretty sweet life herself...on the other side of the country. But circumstances — that she'd prefer to never speak of again — have brought her back home, helping out her parents and substitute teaching at her old high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's facing bickering, raging hormones, constant gossip, awkward weirdness, and drama galore...and that's just the teachers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just like old times...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Garrett offers to show his former high school sweetheart the secrets of his winning teacher ways, Callie jumps at the chance - and then has to stop herself from jumping him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good friends are all they can ever be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or...these teachers just might end up getting schooled — &lt;i&gt;by love.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Her love was greedy. Their love was infinite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lead singer of the start-up band Four Real, Tricia Donahue left her hometown with one question. How can you love three men at once? She’s convinced herself that it can’t be done—not without living up to her family’s infamous reputation. Now, years later, lead guitarist Michael Hill is touring with world famous TRE, far removed from the small town band he once called his family. Home will never be the same until he makes things right. Keyboarder, Pete Morello and drummer, Marty Pierce were always close, but when the one girl they ever loved disappeared from their life, their casual threesomes and life’s hard knocks revealed the feelings they share for each other. Reunion time for four best friends with unfinished business means they will finally face the music. Fantasy…meet reality.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan Quinn delivers a smart and cheeky romance about love’s power to lift hearts . . . and curses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was supposed to be an innocent night, celebrating my brother’s birthday. Nothing was supposed to go wrong. We’d vowed to be on our best behavior after all . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it only took one rowdy night with my brothers to flip my world upside down. One unlucky encounter saddled us with a family curse and the promise of doomed relationships. I laughed it off immediately. “Yeah, right,” I thought. “A love curse. Ha!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word spreads quickly in a town like mine; rumors about that night soon made us the most eligible yet untouchable bachelors in Port Snow, Maine. As a subject of endless gossip and speculation, I could kiss my dating life goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have stayed that way if Ren Winters, the new girl in town, hadn’t crashed into my life. Brave, beautiful, and smart—her vivacious thirst for a fresh start has given me hope that maybe, just maybe, I can have one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wishes for that second chance . . . but could this really be mine?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Verbally abused by her mother for years, 18 year old Ellie Johnson always believed she would never be loved or wanted by anyone. She focused all of her attention on her grades and getting into the University of Texas to start a new life away from her mother.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Ellie expected was to fall in love with Gunner Mathews, a starting linebacker for the University of Texas football team and not to mention, her brothers best friend. &lt;br /&gt;Gunner only had two passions in life, football and his grandfather’s ranch, until he falls for his best friends little sister. He will stop at nothing to show Ellie how much he wants her, even if it means he has to move faster than she would like. &lt;br /&gt;Gunner knows they are meant to be together forever, but Ellie keeps denying her feelings out of fear of being hurt again. Every time he gets close to winning her love, something pushes her away again. Will Ellie ever be able to let go of the past and let him into her heart and will Gunner be patient enough to wait for her?&lt;br /&gt;What will it take for them to realize they are all each other have ever WANTED?</description>

  <description>Greyson East left his mark on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the young girl who first fell for him, I didn’t know much about life. I did know about his smiles, though, and his laughs, and the strange way my stomach flipped when he was near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life was perfect…until it wasn’t, and when we were forced to go our separate ways, I held on to our memories, let go of my first crush, and wished for the day I’d find him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wish came true, it was nothing like I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t have known when I took the nanny position that it would be his children I looked after, that my new boss would be that boy I used to know, that boy who was now a man—a cold, lonely, detached man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smile and laugh I had loved so much were gone, now distant memories. Every part of him was covered in a fresh pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he realized who I was, he made me promise to do my job and my job only. &lt;br /&gt;He made me promise not to try to get to know him, not to recall the memories I’d treasured all this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, sometimes, I saw the boy I’d once known in his stormy eyes. I saw the Greyson who smiled and laughed, who had stolen a young girl’s heart, and there was no doubt in my mind that this boy was worth fighting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a second chance with the one who’d left his mark on me. All I hoped was that somehow I’d leave a mark on his soul, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Eleanor &amp;amp; Grey is a complete Standalone novel**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Saying Andi's had better days is an understatment.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her cookie business is going nowhere fast, and she just walked in on her boyfriend screwing another woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kane and Isaiah, her online gaming partners and the cutest couple ever as far as Andi’s concerned, know exactly how to cheer her up.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Solomon Sanders doesn’t have time to fall in love. Until a stunning, skittish, single mother forces him to pause and recognize just how empty and hollow his busy life has become.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, it’s been ingrained in Solo’s DNA to fight.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for what he believes is right.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for the people he loves.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for the traces of good in a place which tends to be filled with a variety of bad.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for survival, so at some point, his life will quiet down and find a normal pace.&lt;br /&gt;He wasn’t ready for the impact his secretive, shy, obviously out of place new neighbor was going to have on him. And never in a million years was he prepared to fall head over heels for her and her young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s facing the most important, and the hardest fight he’s ever fought… the battle to win Orley’s damaged heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Orley Vincent’s heart is full of fear, leaving no space for love. Until a big, brash, brawler of a man forces his way in and makes her realize facing her fears is the only way she can ever be free.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, Orley was groomed to believe she wasn’t good enough.&lt;br /&gt;She wasn’t the perfect daughter. Or student. Or girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;But, she has always been the best mother she could be to her daughter, Noble.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping Noble safe has always been the one thing she was determined to do, which ironically, is how she ended up on the wrong side of the tracks, living next door to an unlikely hero. Orley’s a woman on the run. She had no idea her frantic sprint was going to land her in the tattooed arms of a man ready to teach her how to fight for herself… and for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone lies.  When working for a sex mage, it's the only way to stay safe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's the first thing Jaeda learns when she's named as the Chosen.  The mage needs a sacrifice, and she's willing to give it.  Maybe too willing.  After all, this man is lust incarnate; a woman would have to be insane not to want him, even if he is dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But desiring someone's body is very different from falling in love.  In her line of work, the two must never be confused.  She doesn't even know his name!  He's simply The Jackal, a terrifyingly powerful sex mage, and she's his altar.  Her lust fuels him.  He needs it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that puts her in control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, she gets to spend her days with a mage who wields sex like a weapon and his assistant who's as irresistible as some long-lost god brought to life.  The things they do to her body are amazing, and the rest? These men want to spoil her with the kind of riches she's always dreamed of.  It's the best job she can imagine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it's never that easy.  This is supposed to be about making magic - that's it.  Feelings have no place in a mage's temple.  Affection is a curse.  But when the enemy decides she'll make the perfect weapon to steal the Jackal's power, what's she supposed to do?  After all, she's just a stupid girl caught in the middle.  Her job is to just lie back and take it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except, someone's been lying. &lt;br /&gt;It might even be her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;POWER OF LIES&lt;/b&gt; is a complete novel with a reverse harem, polyamorous story line.  It is intended for a mature audience due to the presence of consensual sex, group sex, M/M scenes, and plenty of vulgar language - as well as some potentially triggering violence since the bad guys don't always play nice.  While this is a love story, it may not be right for all readers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Beckett,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re reading this, well, you know the last-letter drill. You made it. I didn’t. Get off the guilt train, because I know if there was any chance you could have saved me, you would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need one thing from you: get out of the army and get to Telluride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My little sister Ella’s raising the twins alone. She’s too independent and won’t accept help easily, but she has lost our grandmother, our parents, and now me. It’s too much for anyone to endure. It’s not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here’s the kicker: there’s something else you don’t know that’s tearing her family apart. She’s going to need help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I’m gone, that means I can’t be there for Ella. I can’t help them through this. But you can. So I’m begging you, as my best friend, go take care of my sister, my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don’t make her go through it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan</description>

  <description>The boys are back in town…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, Kaelin Daume spent a steamy summer home from college secretly hanging out with town bad boy Tyler Wirth and his best friend Nick Kernsted. The connection was warm, complicated, and came to a crashing end when she walked in on her two forbidden friends with another woman. The shocking scene of sex and bondage has haunted her boring, oh-so-vanilla life ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fallout from that night tore Tyler’s life apart. He left Mapleglen, disowned and disgraced, to build a successful advertising career and a unique relationship with Nick. Nothing could bring him back except his sister’s wedding, and he plans to hightail it back to Chicago as soon as it’s over. At least one good thing hasn’t changed: Kaelin is as sweet as ever. Except she doesn’t seem too thrilled to hear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions run high, Kaelin can’t resist the temptation to commit one crazy act of rebellion. Once the web of secrets, sins and lies starts to unravel, though, their lives will never be the same…</description>

  <description>It’s werewolf mating season. All the males are in heat, and the driving sexual lust of their beasts is almost uncontrollable. When Mika finds herself trapped in an alley, surrounded by four horny werewolves, she knows she’s in deep trouble. Until a tall, handsome werewolf rescues her—then demands payment. Hot, sweaty, intimate payment. &lt;br /&gt;Grady is a half-breed whose human mother abandoned him to his werewolf father, so he knows human women just aren’t safe to fall in love with. The wolf within him wants Mika as his mate, but Grady will not give in. Never. Ever. He’s willing to fight his emotions and his beast, no matter how much sexy Mika tempts him. &lt;br /&gt;But neither of them expected her Uncle Omar to assign Grady to protect her from other males—24/7, in her home, sleeping just down the hall. Mika decides to make the best of her vacation and keep the hot wolf in her bed. Grady can’t resist the scorching sex, but he is determined to resist the bond.</description>

  <description>Try – verb: to make an attempt or effort to do something or in this case…someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex. Logan Mitchell loves it, and ever since he realized his raw sexual appeal at a young age, he has had no problem using it to his advantage. Men and women alike fall into his bed—after all, Logan is not one to discriminate. He lives by one motto—if something interests you, why not just take a chance and try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he wants to try Tate Morrison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just coming out of a four-year marriage with an ex-wife from hell, a relationship is the last thing on Tate’s mind. He’s starting fresh and trying to get back on his feet with a new job at an upscale bar in downtown Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, Tate has caught the unwavering and unwelcome attention of Mr. Logan Mitchell – a regular at the bar and a man who always gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night after night Tate fends off the persistent advances of the undeniably charismatic man, but after an explosive moment in the bar, all bets are off as he finds his body stirring with a different desire than his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As arrogance, stubbornness and sexual tension sizzles between the two, it threatens to change the very course of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan doesn’t do relationships. Tate doesn’t do men. But what would happen if they both just gave in and…tried?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENRE: M/M</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My O is missing. Two sex therapists are going to help me find it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hours after Dennis proposes, I find my fiancé with his d*ck buried in Tiffany Slater’s hoohah, and he has the nerve to suggest it’s my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because I’m frigid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I’ve never had an orgasm with him, or with anyone for that matter, but relationships are about more than good sex. (Not that the sex was ever good. Adequate is more like it. Okay, who am I kidding? &lt;b&gt;Dennis couldn’t find his way down there with a flashlight and a map.&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m determined to find my missing O with the help of two of the hottest men I’ve ever set eyes on. Sex therapists Benjamin Long and Landon West. If these two men can’t make me come, then no one can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t have slept with them. I shouldn’t have &lt;b&gt;succumbed&lt;/b&gt; to their sexy smiles. I shouldn’t have listened when their firm voices &lt;b&gt;promised&lt;/b&gt; me all the pleasure I could handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t get enough of them. But when a bitter rival finds out about our forbidden threesome, &lt;b&gt;everything will come crashing down&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>One chef.&lt;br /&gt;Two roommates.&lt;br /&gt;If you can’t take the heat…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex&lt;br /&gt;I’ve got good reason to keep my mouth shut around my best friend Elliot, so when he hires the luscious Joelle Munroe to save his restaurant I can understand his hands-off frustration. But she doesn’t work for me…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elliot&lt;br /&gt;I need a culinary genius — Joelle needs a job. When she turns out to be sweet, smart, and sexy as hell, I can’t blame my best friend for wanting her too. But Joelle wasn't there the night Alex left his bedroom door open and after what we did together... Now they're both in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joelle&lt;br /&gt;Eyes on the prize — get the job, get into school, get my career on track. I’ve got too much on the line to lose my head over my boss, or his roommate's seriously fine ass. And definitely not both at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizzle is a full-length standalone bisexual menage romance including MF, MM, MFM, and MMF lovin’. No cheating, no cliffhangers — nothing but the naughty good stuff!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s a billionaire single dad who needs help.&lt;br /&gt;She’s a sassy single gal who needs work.&lt;br /&gt;Live-in nanny? What could go wrong?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remington Key:&lt;/b&gt; I left the Navy, scored a billion in tech, got married, and had a baby. I did everything by the book. Happily ever after, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward four years, and I’m alone, raising my daughter, caring for my mother-in-law, and trying to keep my stuff together. How did this happen?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was clearly drunk the night I offered a gorgeous girl in a bar $500 a day to be my live-in nanny. Or maybe it was my dick talking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if I’ve been alone since forever? I’m focused on launching my new business, not bedding the sexy siren who sleeps down the hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least that’s what I keep reminding myself…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruby Banks:&lt;/b&gt; Remington Key is distant, brooding, and incredibly sexy. And when he scoops up his adorable four-year-old daughter Lillie and blows raspberries on her tummy while she squeals with delight, I totally swoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bumping into him at our local pub that night slightly drunk and overly frustrated was a total accident. He needed help, and he offered me a ridiculous salary. I couldn't say no. &lt;i&gt;Right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s given me the chance to pay off my debts and take control of my life. I can't screw up this job. But as bad as I want to be good, I’m not sure I can fake it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way he watches me sends heat sizzling through my insides.&lt;br /&gt;Our hands touch, our eyes meet, and I want to do &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;very naughty things&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;with my new boss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(A STAND-ALONE CONTEMPORARY Romantic Comedy. No cheating; No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>(Updated version with added extra, why not give this quirky biker ebook a try) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not everything is roses, chocolates and vibrators in Zara's life...until Talon, Hawks MC President, wants to claim her as his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zara Edgingway is a twenty-six-year-old secretary. She has a daughter that apparently knows-it-all and a best friend that could possibly have the mouth of Satan, but she's been with her through hell and back. Then there's the hunk'a'licious biker neighbour finally showing interest in her. &lt;br /&gt;If only she isn't about to face her next obstacle in life, the one she ran from six years ago: her ex husband. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Talon Marcus is the president of the Hawks Motorcycle Club. For two years, he's had his eye on the quiet, reclusive, yet sassy, neighbour Zara. Finally, he has the chance to claim her as his woman. Just when her past catches up with her, she'll need, not only his protection, but the help from his biker brothers. &lt;br /&gt;Now, if only she'd stop fighting him along the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other books in the series: &lt;br /&gt;Climbing Out: #2 &lt;br /&gt;Finding Out (novella) #2.5 &lt;br /&gt;Black Out: #3 &lt;br /&gt;No Way Out: #4 &lt;br /&gt;Coming Out (novella) #4.5</description>

  <description>My name is Courtney Jane Salinger... &lt;br /&gt;and I'm sick of games. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sick of the Friday night bar-scene-cum-meat-market. &lt;br /&gt;Sick of the boy-girl, man-woman, mars-venus, flirtation-without-expectation, game-playing nonsense. &lt;br /&gt;Sick of awful dates and one-night stands, booty calls and guys who don’t call back, mixed messages or NO messages and—and—and...I'm sick of all of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m done. &lt;br /&gt;I just can't do it anymore. &lt;br /&gt;It's too hard, and worse: little by little, it's making me hard. &lt;br /&gt;It's breaking my heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What DO I want? &lt;br /&gt;That's easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want a house in suburbia with a white picket fence. &lt;br /&gt;I want babies to buckle into a minivan. &lt;br /&gt;But most of all, I want to be married. &lt;br /&gt;I want a husband. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I've made an important decision: I'm making my escape from the dating world and the single life. &lt;br /&gt;I've filled out my application on ArrangeMe.com and I'm putting my fate into the hands of experts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it a little scary? &lt;br /&gt;Sure. &lt;br /&gt;I mean, I have no idea who I'll end up with. After all, I'm planning to marry a complete stranger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But between you and me? &lt;br /&gt;I can't wait. &lt;br /&gt;Being arranged can't possibly be worse than being single. &lt;br /&gt;Can it?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Loved it. </strong><br /><br />This book was so unique and different and refreshing. I didn’t see it going the way it did but I am so happy that it did. This is a pretty much new author for me. I’ve only read one book by her. I will warn you this is a cliffhanger which I absolutely hate only because I want it all now...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rock bottom has never felt so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what I tell myself when I bargain with the enemy and score a renovation for my hair salon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enemy? Nick Stamos, my best friend’s older brother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s got a body and face the Greek gods would envy but his personality needs a major overhaul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s surly. &lt;br /&gt;A rule-follower.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention he’s seen me naked? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have crushed on him for years, but the only place I want Nick swinging his hammer nowadays is at my salon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, he needs something in return. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fake girlfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m just reckless enough to say &lt;i&gt;yes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hold Me Today&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the highly anticipated series, &lt;i&gt;Put A Ring On It&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🖤COVER REVEAL: January 3rd, 2019&lt;br /&gt;🖤RELEASE DATE: January 17th, 2019&lt;br /&gt;🖤EXCLUSIVE RELEASE ALERT: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/HoldMeToday" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/HoldMeToday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🖤 BLOGGER SIGN-UPS: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/HoldMeTodayEVENTS" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/HoldMeTodayEVENTS&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>“I’m afraid my vagina might turn itself inside out if you try to give it another orgasm so soon.” — Scarlett Bodine &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised by her three overbearing brothers, Scarlett is a hell-raising tomboy with a tool belt. A tornado stirring up trouble everywhere she goes. Her favorite pastimes? Drinking any man under the table and two-stepping. But she has zero interest in love. Scarlett’s only being neighborly when she claims her sexy next-door neighbor as her new pet project. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Devlin is a man at rock bottom. Marriage, political career, five-year plan to Washington, D.C. All destroyed with one well-placed jab. The golden boy is now the black sheep relegated to Bootleg Springs, a tiny West Virginia town with two claims to fame: 1. Moonshine and 2. The cold case disappearance of a teen girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Devlin just wants to lick his wounds. But Scarlett has other ideas for his tongue… and the rest of him. She’s determined to bring him back to life, even if getting him back on his feet means never seeing him again. But when an old mystery becomes new news, she’ll need his help to survive the scandal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today bestselling author Meghan Quinn comes a forbidden romance about an Irish rebel who falls in love with the wrong girl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Diary, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have gotten myself into a wee bit of trouble—and I'm not talking about the "court mandated community service," or “therapy sessions from bashing a bloke in the head" kind of trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were that simple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. I’m talking about the "falling in love with one of my client's daughters,” kind of trouble . . . The kind of problem I can’t talk my way out of when the truth gets out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I ended up with her phone is a long story—and when she called to get it back, I took things a bit too far. One innocent exchange wound up leading to so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun, new, and totally immune to my charm, Sutton is different. And I had no idea she was the daughter of Foster Green. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blame it on the dark colored stout running through my veins, pushing me toward one bad decision after another. Pushing me toward her even though I know right from wrong; even though she's my client's daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating her might be the best or worst decision I've ever made. Only time, whiskey, and one more roll around the mattress with her will tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roark</description>

  <description>When college football star Graham Lawson is given one last Hail Mary chance to pull up his GPA or lose his spot on the team, he turns to the sweet but shy bookworm from his hometown – the girl who saved his ass back in high school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyler Sutton is beyond stunned when her longtime crush asks her to come stay with him for the entire summer. She’s even more surprised when Graham’s two incredibly hot, fun-loving roommates decide to educate her with a lifetime of firsts she’ll never forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie and Tyson show Skyler friendship, compassion, and love that knows no limits. They even try to protect her from having her heart broken when they convince playboy Graham to keep his hands off of his sexy, little tutor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can two amazing guys really replace the one man who Skyler would give anything to be with? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Graham caves and can no longer resist Sky, will she have to choose between her unconventional relationship with Charlie and Tyson? Or will Graham decide to team up with his roommates to give Sky everything she’s ever dreamed of and more?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gorgeous rock star.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An indecent proposal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can a girl resist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling barista Katie Bloom doesn’t even know who Jesse Mayes is until she inadvertently wins the coveted role of sex kitten in his hot new music video. But by the time she’s in bed with him, she knows his reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love maker. Heartbreaker.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Making out with a stranger in front of a camera crew isn’t how Katie imagined herself getting over a broken heart, but when Jesse touches her, sparks fly. The sex is fake but the chemistry is real, and soon the steamy video is blazing up the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Jesse makes Katie an irresistible offer: act as his girlfriend for six weeks while he promotes his new album. The only catch? Their sizzling make-out sessions will be for the cameras only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is fine with Katie, since she's not about to trust her heart to rock's most legendary lover. Her body? Maybe…</description>

  <description>What happens when you’re responsible for someone else’s future? Or when you end up falling for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa Graham has loved Malus for years. They were once a wildly popular band, topping the charts and leaving broken hearts in their wake. But for the past five years, they’ve been playing the same old hits, incapable of creating anything new. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an assistant working for the band’s record label, Tessa is given the opportunity of a lifetime. Her boss informs her that she must help the band write and record a new album—and she only has seven months to do it. If she succeeds, she’s in line for a huge promotion. If she fails, she’s fired. And so is the band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts out as a desire to keep her job, and perhaps learn a little about the four mysterious musicians she’s always admired, quickly turns into more than anyone could have ever expected. As Tessa spends time with each man, she quickly learns that outward appearances aren’t always what they seem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa may hold the band’s future in her hands…but there might be more at risk than her job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she isn’t careful, she could also lose her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 56K word standalone reverse harem romance. Bonus content is also included for a limited time.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Love</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The Audley twins make me wish I was 15 years younger. 🤣 loved Livvie as well. All were great characters and a nice story. Can’t wait to see how it ends. The way it ends you’d never know it’s a cliffhanger. ]]>

  <description>I’m a full-time single dad to three daughters and CFO at Cloverleigh Farms. I don’t have time to fall in love—I’m too busy trying to run a business, keep the red socks out of the white laundry, and get the damn pillowcases on without owing a dollar to the swear jar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, Frannie Sawyer is beautiful and sweet, but she’s twenty-seven, the boss’s daughter, and my new part-time nanny—which means she’s completely off-limits. It’s bad enough I can’t stop fantasizing about her, what kind of jerk would I be if I acted on the impulse to kiss her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(Exactly the kind of jerk you’re thinking.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Actually, I’m worse than that—because I didn’t stop with a kiss, and now I can’t stay away.  She makes me feel like myself again. She reminds me what it’s like to want something just for me. She’s everything I ever needed, but nothing I ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a former Marine. I should have had the strength to resist her from the start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t. And now I have to choose between the life I want and the life she deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if it means giving her up.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A fun, sweet, and sexy romance with a swoon-worthy rockstar and a single mom that will make your heart burst with happiness.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rockstar Hudson Mitchell is over the glitz and spotlight of the music industry. Desperate for a break from the fast-paced life of fame, he retreats to the one place that has always been home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooksville, California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's the same place where Charlie has taken refuge, trying to build a life for herself and her young daughter. The quiet, small-town atmosphere and her new bakery venture are exactly what she needs to pick up the pieces of her shattered past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they spend more time together, neither of them is prepared for the effect Charlie has on Hudson, and how important she would become for his career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"You don't belong." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No words whispered in anger have ever rung more true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They're the Kings of Brayshaw with the world at their feet, destined for greatness and in need of control.  &lt;br /&gt;I'm the girl from the gutter with nothing to offer and as defiant as they come.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say it doesn't matter, that I'm one of them now, and nothing could ever change that. Not even me, should I dare try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they're wrong. &lt;br /&gt;They underestimate how far I'll go to protect them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trouble is coming...and they have no idea. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is book two in a three book series.</description>

I was slightly disappointed. I felt like I was lost so many times. Hoping book three is better because I loved Raven Maddoc Cap and Royce. ]]>

  <description>From New York Times Bestseller, Corinne Michaels, comes a new second chance standalone romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent twenty years waiting for Trent Hennington to open his eyes and see me. But it was all for nothing. He chose to keep himself guarded and let me walk away, proving that my time and efforts were wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m done being invisible.&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single dance sets my new reality into motion, and I welcome it. After all, Cooper Townsend is perfect. He’s kind, sexy, and attentive—everything a girl could want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I got it right this time.&lt;br /&gt;That my heart could mend, and I would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, some things really are just too hard to walk away from.</description>

  <description>There’s no way I’ll fall for Wyatt Hennington.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can keep his Southern drawl, irresistible smile, and those pick-up lines all to himself. I made the mistake of sleeping with him not once, but twice. I’m not stupid enough to give him round three, especially after he left me in the middle of the night so I could see myself out. I vow to return to Philadelphia and forget him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It proves easier said than done.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the doctor informs me I’m the winner of door prize number two, I put my life on hold and head back to Bell Buckle. Three months and if we can’t make this work, I’m gone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is—when the cards are stacked against us, and I can’t bring myself to leave him, I’ll finally know if he truly loves me or if all my fears were real . . .</description>

  <description>Amy Andrews turns up the heat in her smuttiest little book to-date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had a crush on Stefanie, my best friend’s older sister, since I was fifteen. As a geeky gamer with a bad case of acne, she was totally out of my league. But I’m all grown up now, with a medical degree and an in-depth knowledge of female anatomy I’m not afraid to use. When we cross paths again I finally get my chance to live out a few teenage fantasies and prove I can be her guy. I just have to convince Stef to take a chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stefanie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a resident nurse,I’ve had enough of arrogant doctors to last me a lifetime. I’m not looking for another. I’m especially not looking to hook up with my kid brother’s bestie—ten years my junior—even if he has morphed into a walking, talking, wet dream. If only he wasn’t sleeping in my spare bed for three weeks and making it very clear he wants to be in my bed instead. Not going to happen. I don’t do casual anymore. No matter how much I want to open my legs for the DILF.</description>

  <description>"Girls like you aren't exactly welcomed at a place like this, so keep your head down and look the other way." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the exact words of my social worker when she dropped me in my newest hellhole, a place for "troubled teens". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't listen, and now I'm on their radar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They expect me to play along in their games of hierarchy, to fall in line in the social order they've deemed me fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad for them, I don't follow rules. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad for me, they're determined to make sure I do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inconceivably attractive and treated like kings...these are the boys of Brayshaw High.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm the girl who got in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Releasing January 17th, 2019&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is book one in a three book series</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Behind the "lights, camera, action" of Hollywood lies a world of deception, love, and seduction.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are you ready for Hollywood Royalty?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jessica &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An entertainment journalist was the last thing I thought I would be doing. &lt;br /&gt;I thought once I got my degree, I would be reporting on stories that made a difference, but now all I do is report on who broke up with who and who is dating who. &lt;br /&gt;I was over it. &lt;br /&gt;Then I got my next assignment.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;He’s Hollywood’s bad boy. &lt;br /&gt;He works hard, and he plays even harder. &lt;br /&gt;He’s rude, he’s condescending, and he’s made it known he doesn’t want me on the tour. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;With one month on the road with him, two things might happen &lt;br /&gt;One, I may never work in this industry again. &lt;br /&gt;Two, I may just be like everyone else and fall for Hollywood’s Playboy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows they belong together… except them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daphne Davidson has a problem. She broke up with her boyfriend a month ago and she still hasn’t found a date to her sister’s upcoming wedding. If she goes solo, she’ll be inundated with sly comments about how she can’t keep a man. They aren’t wrong. She can’t keep a man because she’s never dated the one she really loves—her best friend, Jack Reese. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Jack Reese has been secretly in love with Daphne since he knew what love was. Yet she’s never shown any interest in him and he decided being friends was better than nothing. When he finds out that she’s diving into the pit of vipers she calls a family, he’s determined to protect her. Going undercover as Daphne’s date means holding her hand, kissing her lips, and pretending to be in love. The latter part isn’t hard. What’s tough is resisting the urge to claim her.</description>

  <description>Listening length: 7 hours, 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when a sexy, older man moves into your family’s summer rental?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, apparently, you make a fool of yourself—over and over. Things didn’t exactly get off on the right foot with Noah Cavallari. Our first encounter was embarrassing, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite that, I found myself waking up every day with a newfound energy. Nothing exciting ever happened on the lake—not until Noah moved into the small boathouse on our property. He’d booked it for the entire summer…and I was still trying to figure out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my mother became ill, I inherited the responsibility of making sure our guests were well taken care of. I should have been in college. Instead, I was living my best life…as a maid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, handsome, and mysterious, everything about Noah screamed forbidden. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew he was just passing through town for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew he was probably too old for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, I was drawn to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, he tried to save my life when he mistakenly thought I was drowning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted him and made no secret of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His own attempts to warn me away soon gave way to late-night moonlight chats by the lake. We were slowly easing into a friendship that was gearing up to explode into something I might not recover from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he’s leaving at the end of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have no idea what I’ll do when August ends.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Our first meeting as neighbors was screwed from the start.&lt;br /&gt;He was hot. I was naked. And we had no chance in hell at ever being platonic.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll be the first to admit that I live at extremes. After going ten years locked in what felt like a dysfunctional marriage, I’m now decidedly boy-free. In nearly three years I’ve had no boyfriends, no flings, no dates and &lt;i&gt;no sex&lt;/i&gt;. For the sake of my dream career, the sacrifice has been easy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least it was.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he came along.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lukas Hendricks. He’s rude, gorgeous, arrogant – a stone-carved wall of muscle and distraction. He’s everything I know to avoid but there’s no avoiding your next-door neighbor. Oh yeah. The man now lives three steps from me and to make matters worse, he crashed into my life while I was relaxed in the tub – mortifying to say the least and it went something like this: I was exposed. He looked. He laughed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then I locked myself out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, Lukas Hendricks was trouble from the start. And me?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was – for the first time in years – about to be screwed.</description>

  <description>A new town. A new identity. Pregnant and alone. &lt;br /&gt;And far away from a past that can never find me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River Wild.&lt;br /&gt;Moody. Sullen. A-hole.&lt;br /&gt;And my new neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no interest in befriending River. And he definitely doesn’t want to be befriended by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, he helps me rescue an abandoned dog. And, that day, I see something in his eyes that reflects back in my own. Sadness. Pain. Loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all of those things well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unwanted and unexpected friendship that somehow works. Then, without warning, it turns into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River and I both have our secrets, and that’s okay. Because I understand him. And he understands me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I have something I never thought I would have—happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But happiness isn’t forever. Not for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially not when my past is waiting just around the corner, ready to come and take it all away.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;They are as different from one another as any three men can be,&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;But they're all big, tough cowboys at heart. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fire had almost taken everything from me,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The job and land I loved, and the family I adored.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Milo has been haunting my dreams since I was a teenager&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And now he looks at me like he's trying to convince himself I haven't grown up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well he's wrong. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His brother Sawyer, the ex-football player, sure noticed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And so has his TV star brother, Eli. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're all back in one place now that the ash has settled, and I find myself in a bit of a conundrum.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want them. All. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As tensions run high and a big-money deal is on the table, &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The formerly close brothers can't agree on anything.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Except that they'll do anything to save me when I face the biggest nightmare of my life.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dirty Cowboys is the third standalone novel in the Spenser Sisters Reverse Harem series. Each book can be read independently from the other. If you like hot reverse harem romances with powerful women and sexy men with plenty of steam and a guaranteed HEA, you'll love the Spenser Sisters!&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>All I wanted was a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I got was a broody, enigmatic demigod with an electrifying touch and a mysterious past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We were night and day in every way possible, not an ounce of anything in common, and yet, I wanted him in the worst way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It didn't matter that he was emotionally unavailable or that he was exactly the kind of man who would give my father a coronary should I dare to bring him home. It didn't matter that his heart was wrapped in barbed wire or that he made me promise never to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;None of it mattered because he was the most perfectly imperfect, beautifully tortured soul I'd ever known, and I was besotted, addicted to all the thrilling and wondrous ways he made me feel when we were together.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say a single moment can change the entire trajectory of your life. But looking back, I never could have imagined all the ways my world would change the moment it collided with his.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I learned too late that he kept his past a secret for a reason.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had a hard time at first with this book. I wasn’t a fan of Kevin. Then as the story progressed he grew on me. The story hit too hard at times. Lee man she is an amazing and strong woman and I loved her. Great quick read if you can get past Kevin in the beginning. ]]>

  <description>"When times get tough, the tough stage one scorching-hot intervention. "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Powertools, Book 6"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan is happy that her best friend Kate is expecting the crew s littlest member, but helping renovate a room for a nursery is more than she can bear. Baby furniture and pastel paint are a painful reminder that she and Joe can t and will never conceive. There s no hiding it from the rest of the close-knit crew, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to their unique brand of love, the gang rallies to find a non-traditional solution to alleviate their friends suffering. Not with a cold, clinical visit to a sperm donation clinic, but delivering it the old-fashioned way. With a healthy dose of searing passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon after Morgan s scorching hot night with her husband s four best friends, an accident threatens the life of one of those men. The challenges that lie ahead will test the crew s powerful bond to the limit and their long-standing promise to take care of each other through good, bad, and sexy times. Whatever it takes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Not everything in life turns out as planned, but with love all odds are surmountable. Especially when those odds include five hot construction workers on your side. Contains m/m/f group m nage scenes.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The crew is back and they’re dirtier than ever. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five sexy men with a penchant for love and lust in any variation have formed a crew. They work hard and play harder—together. Though their partnership began in construction, renovating houses and selling them for a mint, they’ve formed a bond around their shared goal to provide women, and each other, with the ultimate sexual experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, as each member discovered his soul mate—or two—they expanded the reach of their circle, lighting up their nights along with their souls. Monogamous relationships and the desire to start families threaten to put their libertine revelry on the back burner. Will the passion that bonded them fade away? How will the new crew wives cope with the complex relationship the men will always cherish and crave? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to prove they stand by their men, the women decide it’s time to flex some muscle and give the crew a dose of girl power. They collude to take the guys as their horny hostages, using some big guns: boudoir photos, a pillow fight and a calculated foray into partner swapping. But will they have the guts to go through with their plans? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: By Book Five in this series, fans will attest that anything goes in the crew. Be prepared for ménage in every flavor—m/f, f/f, mfm, fmf, and more—along with a slew of &lt;i&gt;that's what&lt;/i&gt; he &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt; jokes. No throwing tomatoes at the author, please! &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Will his boyfriend’s girlfriend become his girlfriend too?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Powertools, Book 4&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;James has watched each of the crew fall in love, one by one, until only he and his life partner Neil remain “unattached”. So, when he sees the way his bisexual boyfriend is checking out their new apprentice, he’s sure he’s doomed to lose the man of his dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His love is strong enough that he would let go to ensure Neil’s happiness. Instead, sparks fly between the three of them—along with the rest of the crew—and he realizes he might not have to surrender because his boyfriend’s girlfriend is becoming his girlfriend too.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br /&gt;The world’s first m/f/m/f/m/f/m/m/f…we think. You never know exactly what’s going to happen next when the crew gets back together, but it’s guaranteed to be steamy.</description>

  <description>One blizzard, two days, three men to keep her warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Powertools, Book 3"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naked is Kayla's style. She's exposed to bare skin more than the average person-like when she's up to her elbows in massage oil, soothing the tired muscles of the construction crew building her new spa, a barter to offset some of the cost. Once it's finished, she plans to open a private retreat for fellow naturists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be a routine service. Yet for some reason, caressing the man on her table is blurring her normally crystal-clear distinction between nudity and sexuality. And stirring up kinky fantasies involving the rest of the crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never intended to share details about her lifestyle-slash-business plan, not even with the open-minded, sexy crew. But when a faulty truck engine and one hell of a snowstorm trap the three men at her cabin, heat sears away her cover story-and her inhibitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocooned in blissful isolation, Dave, Neil and James show her that passion knows no barrier, with or without clothing. Leaving Kayla wondering if two days of mutual satisfaction will ever be enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book features a m/m/m/f menage hot enough to melt an entire blizzard's worth of snow and ice.</description>

  <description>Nothing’s sexier than men with power tools. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sultry summer heat has nothing on the five-man crew renovating the house next door. No one could blame Kate for leaning out the window for a better view of the manscape. The nasty fall that follows isn’t part of her fantasy—but the man who saves her from splattering the sidewalk is definitely the star. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Mike personally attends to her injuries, she realizes her white knight in a hard hat has a tender side, giving her no choice but to surrender to the lust that’s been arcing between them since day one. In the aftermath of the best sex of her life, she whispers her most secret desire: to be ravaged by his crew. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She never expected Mike would dare her to take what she wants—or that the freedom to make her most decadent desires come true could be the foundation for something lasting… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book may cause you to spontaneously combust as five hot guys bring a woman’s wildest fantasies to life during one blazing summer affair.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t sleep with your teammates.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was the one rule they emphasized to us ladies at the Fire Academy. The kind of rule that existed for a crucial reason. &lt;br /&gt;And it was an easy rule to follow… Until I got transferred to Miami Fire Station 47.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With just two weeks until Christmas, Firefighter Amy Pederson is transferred to a special new fire station in the suburbs of Miami. It’s a tremendous honor to have been selected out of hundreds of applicants, but Amy can’t help but feel like she doesn’t belong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And it only gets worse when she meets her three sexy unit mates, some of whom aren’t too thrilled to have a woman on their team. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet as they take holiday calls together they begin bonding in ways only a close-knit group who risk their lives together can. Every time they throw on their gear and stride into the swirling smoke their petty differences seem silly by comparison—especially with rumors of a holiday arsonist plaguing Miami. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now Amy has the opposite problem: she and her new unit mates are beginning to like each other &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; much, a temptation that’s impossible to avoid while living with three delicious firefighter hunks. Can Amy douse her unrelenting feelings while searching for the arsonist, or will everything go up in smoke? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five Alarm Christmas&lt;/b&gt; is a sexy, stand-alone reverse harem romance filled with humor, action, and mystery. It also contains sizzling hot MFMM menage sex, in single and multiple partner scenes. HEA guaranteed!</description>

  <description> She thinks she’s broken and I’m the one to fix her.  &lt;br /&gt;As an ex-Navy SEAL there are a few guarantees in life. &lt;br /&gt;Avoiding relationships is one of them. Dealing with PTSD is another. &lt;br /&gt;So when I come across the Reckless Bastards MC, it’s perfect for a man like me. &lt;br /&gt;Last thing I expect is to encounter Jana Carter at a painting class. &lt;i&gt;Don’t ask why I was there.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can hardly keep my eyes off of her. She’s a shy, sultry vixen, and she grabs a hold of me so hard, I can’t let go. &lt;br /&gt;But, I don’t expect to fall for any women—much less find one who can deal with me and my messed up past. &lt;br /&gt;Just when I thought I’d built strong walls around my heart, I discover her walls are reinforced with steel. She’s so pure, so innocent—and hard. &lt;br /&gt;Against all the odds, I want her. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll do anything to have her, to make her &lt;i&gt;mine.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love filthy talking bikers who can drop your panties with just a whisper? You got it! &lt;br /&gt;Beautifully Broken is a full-length standalone romance with no cheating, no cliffhangers and a guaranteed happily ever after!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>January 2019&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carson is a mother who has never carried a child. She’s raised Axe as her own son. He is her responsibility, but she wouldn't want her life any other way, even if it’s not exactly what she had planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waitress in a small town diner. A single mother. She hides in plain sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keys is a mystery to his Canadian brothers. A recent transfer from the Notorious Devils in North Dakota, and the new tech expert for the club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His life has been one big party. No responsibilities. No relationships. No commitments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he walks into a small diner in Texas. He recognizes her. She’s the girl from his past, and yet, she’s not--she’s all grown up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hides a secret that once he discovers causes rage to flow through his veins. He cannot simply let her go. He did that once--never again. Especially now that he knows the truth. He plans on keeping her as his own.</description>

  <description>I didn’t know she was my student the first time I paid to watch her at Voyeur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she walked into my classroom, another smiling college freshman, I knew I should stop going. Stop watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I couldn’t do it. Everything about her makes me want more, and once I realize she wants me too, the temptation becomes irresistible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that she has no idea her professor is the one watching behind the glass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have to hope that once she finds out the truth, she wants the same thing I do. Because now that I've seen all of her, I can't look away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stand-alone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42425208-the-lovers" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved him first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake was my best friend in college-my very straight best friend, until one night he was more. He may have ran after what happened between us, but I never forgot him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When fate puts us in the same place, five years later, he has a fiance by his side. Carina is beautiful, driven, and draws my attention almost as much as he still does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A game of truth or dare leads to a wild night and a relationship that has our feelings growing into something bigger than any of us intended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what happens when our feelings deepen? Can I handle being with two people? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it means I can have him, I’ll love them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the final book in the two-book duet. Book one must be read first.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One man thinks I'm a saint. &lt;br /&gt;The other thinks I'm a sinner. &lt;br /&gt;One man lives in the public eye. &lt;br /&gt;The other lurks in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;One man wants to use me for his own needs. &lt;br /&gt;The other wants to use me for his revenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One man will get what's coming to him. &lt;br /&gt;The other will get what he deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They told me good girls get rewarded. &lt;br /&gt;But I've been bad. Very bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I made a deal with The Devil...and I liked it.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Please note: This story contains content that may be offensive to some readers.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The problem with secrets is that they’re too easy to keep collecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Allen has done some things she would rather no one ever know about. She also knows that, if she could go back in time, she wouldn’t change a single thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three sisters she loves, a job she (mostly) adores, and a family built up of friends she’s made over the years, Luna figures everything has worked out the way it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one of those secrets involves the man who signs her paycheck, she can’t find it in her to regret it. Despite the fact that he’s not the friendliest man in the world. Or the most patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes there are things you’re better off keeping to yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Let him who is without sin cast the first stone…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the second-most hated person in Amber Springs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First place honors go to my twin, Ethan; however, hate isn’t a strong enough word to convey how people feel about him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I blame anyone—some days, I hate him too. Mostly, I’m just lost and afraid, drowning in a sea of betrayal and guilt, wondering how this happened right under my nose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s no choice but to leave. To move clear across the country in a last-ditch attempt to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transferring to a new school midway through senior year is hellish for most people. For me, it’s a welcome relief—until someone discovers our secret and now everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointing, whispering, and scathing looks follow me around again, and I’m back to square one. Except, this time, I’m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axel, Skeet, and Heath took me under their wing from the minute I arrived here. I’ve no idea why three of the hottest guys in town took any interest in me or why they continue to have my back, but I’m so grateful to have them in my corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, right now, they’re the only reason I’m not following my brother into an early grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;This is an upper YA/NA reverse harem STANDALONE contemporary romance. Due to sensitive content, sexual situations, and possible triggers, this book is recommended to readers aged 18+. Full length novel.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>A new stand alone office romance from USA Today bestselling author K.A. Linde...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always had one rule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t mix business and pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Landon Wright comes home to his family’s construction company with a broken back and a beaten heart and ends up as my new sexy boss. As the office gets heated, I’m thinking about throwing the rulebook out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only there weren’t a million reasons this could never work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have shared a single perfect kiss, but I can’t let our intense connection cloud my judgment. Not with everything I’ve worked for on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating your boss is so very, very wrong…even if he feels so Wright.</description>

  <description>I'd dated his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t remember and I wish I could forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have sworn off the Wright family a long time ago. But when I returned home, Jensen Wright crashed into my life with the confidence of a billionaire CEO and the sex appeal of a god. Even I couldn’t resist our charged chemistry, or the way he fit into my life like a missing puzzle piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad he’d forgotten the one thing that could destroy us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Jensen Wright doesn’t share. Not with anyone. And if his brother finds out, this could all go down in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it all was said and done, was he the Wright brother?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s bossy, moody, and overprotective.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also a pro athlete who needs to focus on winning games and staying out of the headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m fiercely independent and need a man like I need a second period each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when our worlds collide, I never expected him to be the one to jump in and save me. Especially not when my roommate disappears, leaving me with her baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m clueless about babies—and it shows. Good thing Alexei isn’t. With six nieces and nephews and an apparent hero complex, the dude is both sexy and more than capable. It’s a combination that makes it easy to forget we’re just playing house.</description>

  <description>Levi Munroe’s life consists of his friends Tyler and Kyle, a lot of ink and having a good time, but most importantly, his heart only has one reason to beat. Nix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoenix Silverstone came into his life and put him through an emotional roller coaster. No one knows what they sign up for when they fall in love, and Levi is no exception. Dealing with his girlfriend’s negligent biological father, and her old demons returning to tempt her, Levi has way more on his plate than he bargained for. It can break them or make them stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both getting to know each other more, they fall deeper in love and are ready to take on the next step. With their wedding approaching, Levi wants what is best for her. A time apart turns out to be exactly what Nix needs but in Levi’s world, it means moping around missing the girl of his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More love, more ink, more Kyle and definitely a whole lot more of Levi. Can Nix and Levi survive the reality of their life together or will it break them apart?</description>

  <description>*MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY 18+* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoenix Silverstone more commonly known as Nix, is a twenty-one year old that has finally discovered her freedom. After living under the strict rules and protection of her mother, Nix moved out with her two best friends in a quaint little Seattle apartment. For the first time Nix is finally able to spread her wings and breathe. Together, they get a job working at a bar and for the first time everything is perfect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freedom, friendships, a great job and fantastic man on the verge of becoming hers. Tristan is the suave, intelligent, not to mention gorgeous law student that Nix has her eyes and heart set on. For the first time, she has her life together; that is, until her path crosses with Levi. The charming, tattooed and downright sexy bad boy that Nix knows she needs to avoid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one of her friends moves out she is shocked to find that her new roommate is none other than Levi. Flirting. Desire. Undeniable temptations. Nix can’t deny the chemistry surging between them but she can’t forget her mother’s extreme hate towards bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Nix have the strength to listen to her heart? Or will her mother’s rules cost her everything?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Devil is part of the Cards of Love Collection. You do NOT need to read any other books in the collection in order to read The Devil. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They'll tell you I seduced them. Used my looks and body to lure them into my playground. &lt;br /&gt;They'll tell you I'm a sinner. A demon who held them captive with temptation and lust. &lt;br /&gt;They'll tell you I'm evil.

  <description>&lt;b&gt; She needed to be loved... &lt;br /&gt;He needed to be saved.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Preston&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an opportunity comes knocking, you shouldn't question it. &lt;br /&gt;Unless it comes in the form of a 5'2", feisty, loudmouth girl who just so happens to hate your guts. &lt;br /&gt;The same girl you haven't been able to get out of your head for three years. &lt;br /&gt;But, I'm a gambler by nature. A risk taker. &lt;br /&gt;So when Kit Bishop makes me an offer I'm in no position to refuse... I take it. &lt;br /&gt;I just have to make sure I don't end up giving her more than what we both bargained for. &lt;br /&gt;Like the fucked-up thing beating in my chest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Kit&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's no one on earth I hate more than Preston Holden. &lt;br /&gt;As if our past didn't give me enough of a reason—he's also a cocky, arrogant jerk with a gambling problem. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, he just so happens to be the only guy I can ask to help me with my issue. &lt;br /&gt;It's simple. &lt;br /&gt;He needs the money. I need a husband. &lt;br /&gt;It's strictly business. A one-year stint between enemies. &lt;br /&gt;No strings. No feelings—other than our mutual dislike for one another. &lt;br /&gt;But the thing about hate? It can flip on a dime. &lt;br /&gt;It can have you questioning things about yourself you never thought you would. &lt;br /&gt;And if I'm not careful—things are going to get even more complicated between us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You know the saying—&lt;i&gt;'til death do us part?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, in our case? It includes all the complicated parts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; This book is part of a series. Book one needs to be read prior to this book. &lt;br /&gt;Complicated Hearts (&lt;i&gt;featuring different characters&lt;/i&gt;) does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have to be read in order to read this series. However, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some spoilers for the Complicated Hearts duet.</description>

  <description>Please note: At this time, there is no release date for the final book in the series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say everyone has either an addiction, obsession, or weakness in this world. Something that can penetrate you down to the core and influence you in a way nothing else can. &lt;br /&gt;I have all three. &lt;br /&gt;One happens to be &lt;i&gt;her.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kit Bishop is in my veins. &lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately for me, she's the drug I'll never be able to indulge in and the high I can't chase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because I'm a liar. &lt;br /&gt;A thief. &lt;br /&gt;And I've destroyed everything that's ever been mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author note: This book is a spin-off featuring different characters from the Complicated Hearts duet. It is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; necessary to read the Complicated Hearts duet in order to read Preston and Kit's story. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Things are going to get...complicated. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is Book Two (the &lt;b&gt; final&lt;/b&gt; book) of the Complicated Hearts Duet. Book One must be read first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is not for everyone. These characters are flawed and the situation is intense and frustrating. Emotions—all of them—run high. If you're looking for perfect characters and a perfect story...this book isn't for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trigger Warning: &lt;br /&gt;This story is strange and unconventional. It's everything you hate. That's the only warning I can offer you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Breslin&lt;/b&gt;—I was in love with Asher Holden the moment I saw him...and I knew nothing would ever be the same. &lt;br /&gt;Then he hurt me. He wrecked me. He ruined me. &lt;br /&gt;I spent three years putting myself together—fixing what he broke.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I'd see him again after that day. &lt;br /&gt;I was counting on it. &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know—life had other plans...and things were going to become a lot more complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asher&lt;/b&gt;—I finally know who I am. I own it, I embrace it...I'm no longer afraid. &lt;br /&gt;I live my life with no regrets now, because I've learned my lesson—the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had it all figured out. &lt;br /&gt;But then my past collides with my present...and things become complicated.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out I don't really know myself after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Landon&lt;/b&gt;— My life was all mapped out. &lt;br /&gt;I knew exactly what direction I was heading in—I didn't have time for any roadblocks or obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;Then I meet her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; him. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my heart is split right down the middle. &lt;br /&gt;She controls the rhythm. He controls the melody. &lt;br /&gt;Complicated doesn't even begin to cover it...and there's only one way this can end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story is for mature readers only, due to language and sexual themes. This story contains explicit content featuring m/f, m/m, m/f/m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trigger Warning: &lt;br /&gt;This story is strange and unconventional. It's everything you hate. That's the only warning I can offer you.</description>

  <description>“Sometimes love happens when you least expect it.” That was what my husband’s mistress told me the day I found out about their affair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t believe it until five minutes later when mouth-watering celebrity chef Tanner Reese walked up, tossed his arm around my shoulders, and told my cheating husband to take a hike. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tanner and I couldn’t have been more different. He spent his weekends at clubs, rubbing elbows with fellow A-listers. I spent mine in yoga pants with cheese boards and a glass of wine—or six.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our relationship shouldn’t have worked, but it did. That is until Tanner proved to me that even though love happens when you least expect it... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So does heartbreak.</description>

  <description>Coming November 29!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when the cute mountain man you made out with in an ice fishing shack turns out to be your brother’s best friend? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole lot of awkward, that’s what. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie’s mind is reeling when she discovers the guy she became tangled up with at Marv’s Bait &amp;amp; Tackle isn’t a stranger like she thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big snag: Sam and Maggie’s chemistry is hot enough to melt ice, which makes keeping their secret far more difficult than either expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when one of them decides they want this arrangement to be more than just a catch and release.</description>

Amy Daws knows how to make someone laugh. I seriously need to read her other books. If your looking for a laugh and some swoon then this book is for you!! ]]>

  <description>When I was five years old I told Toren Grace I was going to marry him when I grew up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned eighteen I made it clear I still felt the same. The problem? He's fifteen years older than me and he's my father's best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toren Grace. My father's best friend. My pseudo-uncle. &lt;br /&gt;He's always been my rock. The one I should never, ever want. &lt;br /&gt;But I do want him, and I love him. &lt;br /&gt;I always have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tor's one of the good guys. Loving. Devoted. A strong moral compass. One kiss between us rocked him clear off his axis. Now we can't forget how that kiss felt, and what it changed. Nothing will ever be the same between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know he's struggling with his feelings, but I'm determined. I'm not a little girl anymore, and we can't deny we were meant to be together. The heart wants what the heart wants, and it doesn't care about age or how we met. My father cares, though. And he's the one person neither one of us can stand to hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all being torn apart, and I don't know how to make everyone see that the wrongs are actually right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Torn can be read as a single book.</description>

  <description>(This is a sequel novella to Storm, book one - which must be read first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie&lt;br /&gt;I met him in a snowstorm...&lt;br /&gt;We spent forty-eight hours trapped in the back of his pickup truck.&lt;br /&gt;We fought.&lt;br /&gt;We touched.&lt;br /&gt;We fell.&lt;br /&gt;Hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storm&lt;br /&gt;She literally crashed into my life...&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I wanted was a relationship. Especially with a quirky chick who drove me insane. But something about her got under my skin, and into my heart.&lt;br /&gt;And I had to have her.&lt;br /&gt;All of her. &lt;br /&gt;Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love in the back of a truck, just the two of us, was easy.&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with psycho fans, jealous exes, and demons from the past....not so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving Storm is a fast-paced SWEET (not erotica, not a lot of drama) novella that gives an extended look into Storm and Evie's future. It is best read after reading Storm (and also Vandal, Lukas, and Talon, as those characters will have short cameos in this book).</description>

  <description>DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL PARTNER:&lt;br /&gt;Caring. Hard-working. A devoted family man, loves kids.&lt;br /&gt;Clean cut, funny, smart, quiet, but a good communicator.&lt;br /&gt;~ Asia Jenson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL PARTNER:&lt;br /&gt;Independent. Tall, blonde, sexy. Outgoing. Intelligent, neat. Confident. Loves to travel. Committed.&lt;br /&gt;~ Talon Valentine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.&lt;br /&gt;The concept was scary but exciting... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marry a total stranger.&lt;br /&gt;Live together for six months.&lt;br /&gt;Journal everything. (Feelings. Fights. All of it.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months, we each get $50K in trade for our journals, whether we stay married or not. But the goal is to commit to the experience and see if the relationship experts could put together the perfect matches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never been lucky in love. This is my chance to find my soulmate, and hopefully, the man of my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't wait to meet the man the experts felt was perfect for me, but my hopes were immediately shattered when I saw him at the altar.&lt;br /&gt;Crap. I married my worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;Right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This book has no cliffhanger, and a happily ever after ending. Talon can be read as a single book.</description>

I laughed I swooned as usual and I did shed some tears in this one. Especially the story at the end about the real Talon and Asia. The animals always make me cry.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thirty-six year old mother of two finds out life isn't over after divorce when a sexy as hell twenty-four year old tattoo artist kisses her senseless one night under a shooting star.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy thought she had it all--married to her high school sweetheart, two great kids, and a beautiful house. But her world comes crashing down when she catches her husband with another woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend gives her a gift certificate to a local tattoo parlor to cheer her up, Ivy gets a helluva lot more when inked-up Lukas Valentine--renowned tattoo artist, violin player extraordinaire, and extreme hopeless romantic--captures her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lukas is an old soul with a heart of gold. When Ivy walks into his shop, he's instantly drawn to her shy smile and down to earth personality. Tired of the dating scene, Lukas is ready to settle down, and he's hell-bent on making Ivy believe they can have the happily ever after they both dream about - with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their age difference, the chemistry and love they share is undeniable. Lukas is everything Ivy never knew she wanted in a man, but can she trust her heart with a much younger man, and can they overcome the hurdles that life keeps throwing in their way? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Lukas can be read stand-alone</description>

  <description>She takes my breath away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s so beautifully damaged. &lt;br /&gt;A mirror of my own tortured soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was powerless to stay away from her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was responsible for all the pain and grief that brought her to her knees in front of me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken. Hopeless. Reckless in her agony. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I took away I can give back…in ways she cannot even begin to imagine. &lt;br /&gt;Ways that I can’t stop thinking about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together we spun a tangled web of lust and need. Power and submission. And dare I say... trust and love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re everything right in all our wrongs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found redemption. We found happiness. A chance for a new beginning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but... she has no idea I’m the one who destroyed her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Vandal is a dark romance with light BDSM. This book deals with death, grief, deception, substance abuse, depression, and graphic sex. If this is not your thing, you can skip this book and move onto the next in the series and you will not be lost or miss anything in the series. Can be read stand-alone as well. **</description>

  <description>The calm before the storm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was living a quiet, somewhat boring life. Safe and comfortable. Until a winter storm came. The wind rustled in warning, telling me to get out of its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never stood a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A series of weather and road mishaps leaves me trapped in the middle of a blizzard with a complete stranger. In the back of a pickup truck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For forty-eight freakin’ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stranger with long hair, tattoos, and rippling with muscle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stranger with an insanely sexy voice and a smile that turned my insides to jelly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stranger who held me in his arms, calmed me, and then set a fire in me that I couldn’t put out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storm lives up to his name. Beautiful. Dangerously inviting. Tumultuous. Dark. A clash of hot and cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s used to getting everything he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now he wants me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people chase storms for the beautiful thrill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when the storm chases you?</description>

  <description>Tyler Grace was many things.&lt;br /&gt;A killer. A myth. An outcast. A hero.&lt;br /&gt;My prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My childhood and innocence were stolen when I was kidnapped at five years old. For eleven years I clung to my childhood fairytale books, waiting for the prince I hoped would someday save me and carry me off to a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea my savior would come in the form of a scarred recluse, covered in tattoo's, who can't--or won't--speak a word. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the moment our eyes met I knew he was the one. My prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyler Grace is haunted by his tragic past and he's sentenced himself to a lifetime of solitude in the woods. He's as lost in society as I am; scarred just as much on the inside as the outside. Just like me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He saved my life that day he found me and killed my captor with his bare hands. I was warned to stay away from him. But I can't stop thinking about him. I ache to hear his voice and see him smile. And I want nothing more than to be the one to break through his walls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think he's the only one who can break through mine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together we can have love, happiness, and a closeness that once felt impossible to have. But can we overcome the horrible twisted past that ties us together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Tied can be read as a single book.</description>

  <description>Jake McKallister might have been a rock star, but he was no ordinary one. Surviving an unspeakable crime as a young teen had shaped him into a guarded workaholic, and he now lived his life trying to forget. If it hadn’t been for music and the redemption he found through it, he might not have survived. Career success came easily for him. Personal connections did not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When outspoken, vivacious college student Casey Caldwell was paired with the famously reserved rockstar for a friend’s wedding, she was prepared for the worst. What could they possibly have in common? She was a bubbly talker; he was a reclusive loner. His life was filled with music; she couldn’t carry a tune. She’d enjoyed a happy childhood; his was a well-publicized nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet despite their obvious differences, Jake and Casey found each other, and her light balanced out his darkness. Would their love be strong enough to survive the weight of his tragic past? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is a *full-length* standalone romance. Cake is a love story at heart but does deal with a sensitive topic and may not be for all. &lt;br /&gt;Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of eighteen.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>4 and a half *cake* Stars</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It was so much different than your normal “rockstar” novel. There’s no drugs involved. There are sensitive subjects but was written so great. The beginning was kinda rough but after that it picked up and I couldn’t put it down. Can’t wait to read...</strong>]]>

  <description>** I suggest reading blind if you want all the feels! **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people we love are thieves.&lt;br /&gt;They steal our hearts. They steal our breath.&lt;br /&gt;They steal our sanity.&lt;br /&gt;And we let them.&lt;br /&gt;Over and over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you never forget your first time. &lt;br /&gt;Mine was with a homeless musician who effed my brains out under a bridge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was my first love. And fourteen years later, I still can’t get him out of my head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He broke all my rules.&lt;br /&gt;He also broke my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched him climb to stardom, cheering him on from afar.&lt;br /&gt;But I was never a fan; just a girl in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a tornado, he spiraled, leaving a path of destruction in his wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But love conquers all, right? It has to. Because here I stand, ravaged and ruined, needing it to be true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can’t go back, but I want to. Back to the bridge. Back to when he sang only for me. Before he was famous. Before he shattered my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I knew everything about him.&lt;br /&gt;But I could not have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He promised me every tomorrow. And here I am, waiting. &lt;br /&gt;And hoping. &lt;br /&gt;Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**there is no cliffhanger and no cheating in this book</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New Orleans, a city of mystery and magic, of secrets and dreams, and a history drenched in both love and the deepest of heartache.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ballet dancer Clara Campbell arrives in New Orleans, lonely and homesick, she is immediately captivated by the story of Windisle Plantation and the tragic tale that is said to have transpired beyond its gate. Legend has it that it is abandoned by all living souls, but to Clara’s great surprise, it is not a ghost she hears through the stone wall surrounding the property, but a flesh and blood man. A scarred stranger with a pain deeper and darker than the churning waters of the Mississippi river that flows beside his self-imposed prison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ruined man behind the wall hides himself from the world. The last thing he expects is to find a friend in the selfless girl who speaks to him through the cracks in the rock. The girl who keeps returning week after week. The girl who makes him wish for things he has long since given up on. The girl who strikes both fear and hope within his wounded heart. But there can be no future for them, no life beyond Windisle, for no one knows better than him that monsters only live in the dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wish Collector&lt;/i&gt; is the story of shame and triumph, of loneliness and love, and the miracle of two hearts connecting despite the strongest of barriers between them.</description>

  <description>Fate is a fickle fellow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-seven, Vicki had it all. She was a successful Broadway dancer, living the dream in the Big Apple. But when her mother became terminally ill, Vicki left it all behind to go home to cherish the woman who sacrificed everything for her to live her dream. Upon her death, Vicki promised her mother she would dance again, but her heart no longer desired fame and fortune. Now she merely wants to open a dance studio to share her passion with little princesses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nik was thirty-eight, he had it all. A loving wife, a beautiful daughter, and a successful career as an MMA fighter. Two years later, he is a widower with a traumatized princess, and a gym to run. Still haunted by his wife’s last word of encouragement "Dance," Nik tries to ease his pain by renovating the dance studio next to his gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vicki dances into Nik’s life, is fate finding a way to fix their misfortunes? </description>

  <description>Briggs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when we parted ways in Germany? It was the day I broke your heart. What you didn't know was that I was breaking mine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they’d be enough–my husband and my son. That I’d get home and everything would go back to the way it was . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the war. &lt;br /&gt;Before the ambush. &lt;br /&gt;Before you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, no matter how hard I try, I can’t erase the trauma we shared. I can’t seem to forget the way my heart beat in time with yours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is I’m lost without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the nightmare was over when they pulled us from that hole in the ground, but nothing could have prepared me for the war I’d face at home.&lt;br /&gt;I know it’s selfish of me to ask, but, please, I have to see you one last time. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my love, &lt;br /&gt;Scottie</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44429367-player" rel="nofollow"&gt;B07J46M7J7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He plays the bass with expert fingers. He plays women with intoxicating charm. And he’ll play me with the ease of a virtuoso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who better to teach me to play than the master himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m his model student, front row, pencil sharp. Pick up lines? I’ve got them. Free drinks? By the dozen. Kissing? Let me grab my chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most valuable lesson I’ve learned is that there’s so much I don’t know. Like why his touch sets off a chain reaction straight to my nethers. Or how I’m certain each kiss is the best I’ll ever have, until the moment his lips take mine again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s so much I don’t know.&lt;br /&gt;Like the fact that I’m only a bet.&lt;br /&gt;But we are what we are. He’s a player, through and through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m the fool who fell in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Standalone romantic comedy and part of the Red Lipstick Coalition Series--Val's story*</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>😍😍</strong><br /><br />This is the first book I’ve read by Staci and I loved it. Val hit too close to home for me. Me and her both being a size 16/18. Words can’t express what this book made me feel. And Samhir. OMG I wish more men were like him. The world would be a better place. ]]>

  <description>Jane &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been on my own. My life used to consist of nothing but work, keeping Allen out of trouble, and if I had time, sleep. Then I became their maid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day more than half a million people tune in to watch my show. They trust me. I know it’s because I’m the only son of the prominent Emerson family. However, I like to believe it because I’m honest no matter what story I report on. I’m honest about everything but the man I’ve been f**king for the last four years… and now her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wesley &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First I want three things: First Maxwell Emerson and Jane Chapman both in my bed. Second, to be the best bloody chef in the country. Third, to figure out how to simultaneously get the first and second things I want without any of us getting hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THREE PEOPLE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE LOVE STORY….</description>
