  <description>After reuniting with her lover, Jane Doe thought she finally found her place in life.&lt;br /&gt;She has a name, a family and a declaration of love from the enigmatic Edward Rochester, but in a single moment of violence, everything is destroyed. In the aftermath, she’s has no choice but to flee Thornfield if she hopes to save herself from the same darkness that has claimed him.&lt;br /&gt;Alone and afraid, Jane turns to the only person she knows can help, John Rivers. He gladly offers her refuge at his art studio and it is here she hopes to find the way forward into a new life… but Thornfield and the secrets it holds are not done with her yet, and neither is Edward Rochester.&lt;br /&gt;When she comes face to face with the woman who orchestrated her attempted murder, Jane is torn apart by revenge yet again. She’s trapped in a game she does not understand and it’s only the love of the man who wronged her that will save her from making the most fatal mistake of all.&lt;br /&gt;Before all is said and done, Jane must face her feelings and ask herself the ultimate question if she hopes to survive.&lt;br /&gt;Is love enough?</description>

      <![CDATA[Ok, so now that I have finished this series I am just in awe. Danielle has put together a series that really is nothing like but similar to others she has ever written. The similarity is only with <br /> the togetherness, love, affection, passion and THE SEX is just as if not more intense than any book...]]>

  <description>My family was rich with love, but we were broke. So, I was willing to do anything to make sure I created the life I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friends and I catapulted to the top of the popularity food chain following V’s Halloween Costume Party freshman year. It was a lot of work keeping up with the social demands of popularity, but the networking opportunities set me up for future success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was willing to do whatever it took to secure my future, when V extended an invitation for me to join, I jumped at the chance. I was willing to lie, cheat, and steal to reap the benefits of the elusive secret society. A V membership meant doors opened and opportunities knocked. There was only one line I said I wasn’t willing to cross. But when it came down to it, I wavered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People always want to know what V stands for. For me, V stands for vicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did was a betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;It was disloyal.&lt;br /&gt;It was treacherous.&lt;br /&gt;It was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not the villain in this story. But what I did was vicious.&lt;br /&gt;And that’ll haunt me for the rest of my life.</description>

  <description>All her life, all Jane Doe has ever wanted was a name, a family and someone to love.&lt;br /&gt;She’s suffered many hardships, but none have come close to her treatment at the hands of the enigmatic Edward Rochester.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Jane wants to do is love Edward openly, but he has forced her to keep their budding romance hidden. Despite giving him an ultimatum, his will is set in stone and he refuses. His secrets run so deep they’ve driven a wedge between their hearts, keeping them apart but still longing for one another.&lt;br /&gt;Driven by death, madness, rivalry, violence and love, their story inevitably intertwines once more, and they realize they cannot escape the affair they began in the middle of the English summer… but they soon learn not all things were meant to stay hidden.&lt;br /&gt;When Edward’s darkest secret finally sees the light of day, will Jane be able to forgive him, or will she be forced to leave Thornfield forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From International Bestselling author Amity Cross, comes Paradox, the second novel of The Thornfield Affair, a modern reimagining of Charlotte Brontë’s classic Jane Eyre.</description>

  <description>Alison Anders is a nobody.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, awkward and plain, she goes through life under the radar. Until the day comes when she can’t take it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When she hears about the dark and enticing Underground, she gathers up the courage to go. &lt;br /&gt;The Underground is an illegal cage fighting league that’s full of primal violence, debauchery and passion. Where sex and pain are delivered by the alpha male fighters who dominate in the ring.&lt;br /&gt;When Alison steps through those doors, she can be anyone she wants. Anyone but the nobody she is when the sun comes up.&lt;br /&gt;What does she have to lose? Just her heart, body and soul…</description>

  <description>Callie Winslow is on the verge of realizing her wildest dreams. When her cake shop on one of Melbourne’s most vibrant shopping strips opens to the public, she’ll be on her way to the top of the food chain…literally. But one night, days before the launch, everything goes up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;As fire engulfs her shop, Callie is trapped inside with no way out, until a handsome mystery man bursts through the inferno and carries her to safety. Problem is, he vanishes soon after without telling her his name.&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the stranger who saved her life, Callie pulls out all the stops in her attempts at finding him, but she isn’t quite prepared for the man she finally meets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark “Storm” Ryder is a shell of his former self. Accused of a crime he didn’t commit, he was banned for life from professional MMA and sent home with his reputation in tatters. Left with nothing to his name, he fights at the illegal cage fighting league known as The Underground to make ends meet. Plagued by the stigma of his downfall, he’s closed himself off to everything and everyone, believing it’s for the best.&lt;br /&gt;Then one night, he hears a cry for help and rushes headfirst into danger without a second thought. When he pulls a beautiful woman from a burning building, he knows he can’t stick around and face her inevitable judgement, so he disappears, but little does he know, the mystery woman won’t let him vanish as easily as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought together by fate and flames, Callie knows if she wants to crack open Storm’s heart and show him he deserves to be loved, she’ll need to strike while the iron’s hot or risk him disappearing forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Amity Cross comes Strike, the sizzling tenth instalment of the Internationally Best Selling MMA fighter romance series, The Beat and The Pulse.</description>

  <description>Vengeance has a name, and her name is mine. &lt;br /&gt;My role is to take action against the darkest men I’ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;To kill them one at a time. &lt;br /&gt;Until my list is complete. &lt;br /&gt;And in doing so, I’m going to use my most powerful weapon—my body. &lt;br /&gt;They ruined my life, and now it’s my turn to destroy theirs. &lt;br /&gt;Even if it means a death sentence for me, each drop of blood will be deserving. &lt;br /&gt;Each kill will be worthy of the price I may need to pay. &lt;br /&gt;My name is Isadora, and my target is the Moretti Mafia.</description>

  <description>Nicole Janicek already has stared down a high school shooter, a cult of criminal ex-Scientologists and six months of frigid darkness at South Pole Station in her young life, but now she risks it all attempting to ride a rocket to Mars in 2022. After the Red One mission quickly aborts in the skies over the North Sea, Nikki gets a surprise phone call from Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX. What follows is a euphoric, historic, tragic and heroic mission to establish Mars Colony A, dubbed by some in the media as “Mars Colony Agatha” when misfortune strikes. While doubters predict the perilous mission will morph into “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie, Nikki and her crew are determined to write their own story. Through it all, Nikki is surprised to learn how strong her connection to those she loved on Earth remains despite the chasm of time and space.</description>

  <description>Christie Peters has her whole life mapped out for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She plans to marry her boyfriend. Pose for wedding pictures at the Plaza. Then take care of her future children while her husband fights for their country. She would be the perfect trophy wife…or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a new man walks into her life, and Christie takes a temporary break from perfection. Shane introduces her to a world filled with possibilities and unexplainable passion. She starts to doubt every decision she’s ever made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the deeper Christie falls into Shane’s world of underground, illegal street racing, her perfect world begins to crumble around her, and things aren’t as simple as they once seemed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christie has to choose. Is she willing to settle for safety and security? Because one thing is certain—if she decides to walk on the wild side, there’s no going back.</description>

  <description>Last semester, Annabelle fell in love. There are just two problems. Jason is her best friend…and he’s already taken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Refusing to break up a relationship, Annabelle resigns to love him from afar—until a certain hot firefighter walks into her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kingsley is the perfect catch. Rich, attractive, with muscles to boot, and he only has eyes for Annabelle. But things get complicated when he clashes with Jason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With tensions running high and emotions spiraling out of control, Annabelle finds herself torn between her love for Jason, and her new desire for Kingsley. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The longer Annabelle tries to hold on to both men, the more she gets tangled up in a web of lies, secrets, and chilling revelations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, things have gotten worse and Annabelle must do something—before things get ugly…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Violet Carrington is a freshman at Elton Hall University, but she’s about to get more than just her degree…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing herself into the insanity of college life, Violet makes new friends and even catches the eye of a handsome guy. Everything is as it should be, until one night out she crosses paths with a mysterious, sinfully attractive man. Not only does he manage to ignite a burning desire deep inside her, he also happens to be her new, off-limits college professor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Professor David Berneli is only visiting Elton Hall, but a lot can happen in a year…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows any personal relationship between professor and student is strictly prohibited. But somewhere in between lectures and after school events, Violet manages to dazzle him. She not only challenges David at every turn, but also tempts his every desire. No matter how hard they try to ignore the crackle of sexual tension between them, a few furtive glances quickly turn into clandestine meetings in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By giving in to temptation, Violet and David fall deeper down the rabbit hole…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the semester ticks on, Violet begins to question not only the whirlwind affair that threatens to consume them both, but David’s desires as well. If he’s not willing to risk everything for her, she’ll have no choice but to leave the comfort of his arms without looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before any decision can be made, a looming threat comes out of the shadows, putting her and the passionate relationship she has with her professor in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Violet must fight for her own life, and for the one she wants to spend it with…&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>True, I’d been nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous—to have the conversation with him. I knew he was going to think I sounded crazy. I knew he was going to think I was crazy. But I’d nervously fretted about my feelings for him for years. My nerves had sharpened my senses—not destroyed or dulled them. And above all was my ability to listen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d heard all the reasons why we shouldn’t be together. I know I’d given every excuse in the world, every excuse from heaven to hell as to why we couldn’t be together. But my feelings wouldn’t go away, so… how does that make me crazy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen! Sanely and calmly, I’ll tell you the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Tell-Tale is a contemporary romance inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart **</description>

  <description>Eric and Elena Tanner have been enjoying their lifestyle membership at the Club Caliente for years. Swinging fulfills their desire to meet new people and engage in group sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the new bartender, Jess, flirts with them and agrees to play in a threesome, Eric and Elena make plans for a single night of pleasure. All three are satisfied, so Jess is invited to come again. And again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Elena, Jess, and Eric meet up for lots of sex, and dinners. There are casual nights in Netflix and chilling. It's heady, addictive and no one wants it to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they all know that's the deal in the lifestyle. Swingers move out of each other's lives all the time. Complication is the enemy. So what happens when they start to fall in love?</description>

  <description>The year is 1991, and Antonia “Toni” Moskowitz is caught in the middle, always having to pick a side. Whether it’s between her family’s two religions or in her relationships, she has choices to make. Does her heart belong to the outgoing boy with the lime-green nails or the girl in the black velvet skirt? Where does she fit in when both gender and gender roles feel confining?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But learning who she is and who she wants to be with has a price. Every decision has consequences, especially when some kinds of love and expression are still taboo. Sometimes it’s hard to choose between being good and being right. Four seasons. Four kisses. One year to figure out what her heart wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Part of Seasons of Love Anthology&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Buzzing anticipation. Floating weightless. Adrenaline rush. All the best feelings wrapped into an emotional high that never gets old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I might be addicted to falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rising rock star Jack Kingston comes to play on our college campus, I think he’ll be just another fix. Instead, he flips everything around and makes me question who I am, what I want, and why I do what I do. After he leaves, everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushing myself in the pool, struggling to keep up with my twin sister, it’s what keeps me from losing myself entirely. Swimming isn’t my passion. It’s my source of stability. When I find the courage to finally start pushing my boundaries, I discover success in ways I never imagined, both in and out of the water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jack resurfaces, I'm forced to decide between facing my fears or letting them spiral out of control as my past catches up with me... threatening to pull me back under. It's time to sink or swim.</description>

  <description>He was a drug I couldn’t kick. I’d overdosed on him before. It didn’t turn out well.&lt;br /&gt;I was stupid enough to let him crack my heart, in hopes we would fall off the same cliff together. &lt;br /&gt;No matter how much my idiotic heart wanted to love him, my head knew better. &lt;br /&gt;He didn’t choose me. &lt;br /&gt;He chose her. &lt;br /&gt;That’s where the problem started. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe that’s how it should end.</description>

  <description>One day I woke up happier than I could've ever imagined. The sun was shining, the birds singing... I had everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life never goes the way we planned. Sometimes, things come from nowhere and knock us off course, leaving us broken and lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting him gave me a spark of hope, but I won't fall for his promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My time in the Marines has taught me to appreciate the little things in life. I served my country proudly, and would do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting her gave me a new mission, one I accept gladly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never failed an assignment, and I won't start now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll do whatever it takes to show her the inevitable.</description>

  <description>When Brooks walks into my life, I can’t keep from wanting him. He’s perfection—a sexy veterinary student who knows how to cook and always cheers me up when I’m down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I don’t deserve a man like him. There’s a darkness in me that no one could ever love, and I know he’ll abandon me, just like everyone I’ve ever cared about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just like my father. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wouldn’t be able to stand that hurt, so I push him away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then my ex comes back. He betrayed me before, but now he says he wants to make me feel whole again. I know it isn’t right, and I shouldn’t let him into my life. But all I want is to recapture the happiness I once had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But sometimes those who want to fix things leave you more broken, and some friends turn out to be false. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can you tell true love from a lie? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dominique is still alive after killing Tavion, the Tainted who's hunted her for lifetimes. Yet her protectors still fear for her life. They force her to flee Houston and abandon the friends she loves. But they can't protect her from herself. When Dominique starts hearing Tavion's voice in her head, she realizes that her personal connection to the Tainted still exists. And when her car is ambushed, she discovers another frightening truth—someone close to her is a traitor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate for answers, Dominique seeks the aid of first lifers Trent and Infiniti. With their help, she hopes to find her new enemy. But things get complicated with Trent because of her emotional pull toward Farrell, and even more complicated when the whispers in her head threaten her loved ones. Determined to live, Dominique decides to make a final stand against the forces that want to end her. For good.</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Dominique, nothing sucks more than being forced to move across the country during senior year. Angry and feeling alone, she thinks things can’t get any worse until her new neighbor pressures her into playing a psychic card game. When she touches the cards, she has a vision of a red desert where a malignant presence hints at past lives and threatens to kill her... again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s gone crazy, Dominique struggles to forget the experience, but the vision follows her and intensifies with each repetition. Adding to her problems are two gorgeous guys she desperately tries to avoid. If Dominique is to put an end to the evil pursuing her, she must push through her fears and discover the secrets of her past. If she doesn’t, she’ll be dead. For real.</description>

  <description>It started without trust. Passion. Lust. An all-consuming need; that was all we had in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lies. Betrayal. Deceit. We moved past it all and fell in love anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Over ten years later, with a family of our own, our little world was perfect. Happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then that happiness faded away when she came into our lives.&lt;br /&gt;No control. No power. Just heartbreak and unwanted submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were forced to our knees at the sight of her. The words falling from her lips were like nails digging at our soul because we knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would have to go through hell to get out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even then, I wasn’t sure if it would be enough.</description>

  <description>Never trust a man who answers the door wearing nothing more than a pair of low-cut jeans and a panty-melting smirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should've been my first sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write about guys like him for a living — sexy and charming, yet reluctant to get into a serious relationship. His body screams sex appeal, but his condescending personality makes him a classic f*ckboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I want &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing romance novels comes with its perks — traveling, meeting new people, creating characters from the voices in my head — but Ethan Rochester enters my life and rearranges my preconceived notions about writing what inspires you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting him was fate, but falling for him was inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;And forgetting him will be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance! 18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content. Previously published as &lt;i&gt;My Week with the Bad Boy&lt;/i&gt; by Brooke Cumberland &amp;amp; Lyra Parish.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I never thought the vengeance I so desperately needed would be the reason I ended up in a place like this. A place I didn’t need to be. I’m Damon, world class MMA fighter, and I was at the top of my game when he stole her from me - my light, my sunshine. He had to pay for his crimes. But now I’m stuck in rehab, while he plays the victim, waiting to swoop in and steal my Number One title. I am who I am, I don’t need to be here. But maybe someone else needs me to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love can be found in the strangest of places. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rehab is not the place for me - Ford Matthews. I never thought I would end up here. Sure, I loved the thrill of placing a bet, but I didn’t have a problem. At least, that’s what I thought. Little did I know that with each bet I placed, I moved ever-closer to destroying my life - and all those in it. Now I’ve been forced into rehab to get a handle on the addiction. Who knew that in taking this path I would find the one person who sees the real me. A person that would make me be honest with myself and realise that defeating the odds will make me a better person.</description>

  <description>Dr. Emily Dawson has made a nice career for herself. She has a practice of her own in which she spends her free hours treating patients at Princeton's Center of Mental Health. It is at the center where she meets Sophia for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia enters Emily's life strictly as a patient. What begins as a simple diagnosis evaluation soon blossoms into a full fledged midlife crisis for the good doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the very start Sophia begins to influence Emily into evaluating her very own well-being. To get a clearer thought at what she is certain is her exact life lived through another person, she asks about her everyday life, her sex life with her special man, and the power behind it. The more she questions, the more she is reminded of the words of Oscar Wilde: "Everything in the world is about sex, except sex; sex is about power."</description>

Both living a hectic life forces them to drift apart no matter how much time they set aside for one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After overhearing Brandon’s big plan for their relationship, she begins to feel confused, vulnerable, and in need of a night out. She turns to an unexpected source, a band drummer named Ryan Michaels. They both connected instantly, and without warning, Melinda makes the shocking decision to take a venture of a lifetime. One night lead into morning changes everything. Melinda is left with a plate full of challenges between her real life relationship, and her weekend romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she drop everything for love at first sight or will she realize this is just a fantasy?</description>

  <description>I loved him from the age of sixteen. &lt;br /&gt;Hated him from the age of eighteen. &lt;br /&gt;He disappeared at the age of nineteen. &lt;br /&gt;We started off as enemies, then fast became lovers. &lt;br /&gt;But our story isn’t a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;It was a story of a king and a peasant. Can you guess which I was? &lt;br /&gt;I knew we weren’t meant to be. &lt;br /&gt;You see, he fell in love with her first. He loved me last.&lt;br /&gt;I'm not someone's second choice.&lt;br /&gt;Not even for the boy who stole my heart. &lt;br /&gt;I'm someone's first. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I just have to remember that.</description>

  <description>Break.&lt;br /&gt;That’s what my heart did when she stopped breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Effa—the girl who illuminated my world so vibrantly.&lt;br /&gt;And now with a long road in front of me, the path seems unclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought touring with a rock band could lead to this—me falling for the lead singer just for it all to end. All the while back home, life is precarious with my sister’s treatments making everything on edge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Times are tense, revenge is best served cold – Effa makes it hard to breathe, but am I enough for her to take another breath?</description>

  <description>According to my grandma, a broken clock being right twice a day meant that in any given situation, there are only two opportunities for perfect timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for William Grayson in a matter of minutes. The connection between us was undeniable, but our timing was off. I was dating someone and by the time I was single again, he was taken. And a year later, when we finally got together, it was clear that we were soulmates. But circumstances out of our control cut our time short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were a little older, a little wiser, when our paths crossed again. I was entering a new phase of independence in both my career and my life. He was growing professionally and moving to a new city. And even though our timing was off, it was still clear that we were soulmates. But for the second time, circumstances out of our control cut our time short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandma was a wise woman, but my love life taught me that there’s no such thing as perfect timing. There’s just timing… Because nothing is perfect. There’s just right now… Because tomorrow isn’t promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as we’d known each other, William and I just wanted to be together. It was as simple and as complicated as that.</description>

  <description>All Aubrey Ellis wants is a normal life, one that doesn’t include desperate pleas from the dead. Her remarkable gift may help others rest in peace, but it also made for an unsettling childhood and destroyed her marriage. Finally content as the real estate writer for a local newspaper, Aubrey keeps her extraordinary ability hidden—until she is unexpectedly assigned the story of a decades-old murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocked by the discovery of a young woman’s skeletal remains, the New England town of Surrey wants answers. Hard-nosed investigative reporter Levi St John is determined to get them. Aubrey has no choice but to get involved, even at the terrifying risk of stirring spirits connected to a dead woman’s demise and piquing her new reporting partner’s suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aubrey and Levi delve further into the mystery, secrets are revealed and passion ignites. It seems that Aubrey’s ghost gifts are poised to deliver everything but a normal life.</description>

  <description>Piper&lt;br /&gt;At sixteen, I dreamed of fairy-tale endings and living happily ever after with Austin Knight. I was a fool! Austin was no Prince Charming. Rather than sweeping me off my feet, he broke my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was fourteen years ago, and I am completely over Austin. He is in my past, and that’s where he’s going to stay. At least, that’s what I thought until he moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, he’s determined to win me over. It won’t work. I will not think about how good Austin looks playing the drums shirtless, or what an incredible kisser he is. All right, I might think about those things a little, but I’m definitely not going to fall for him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never been the guy who rides off into the sunset with the girl and makes all her dreams come true. I’ve always been the rebound guy, the one who helps rebuild a woman’s confidence after a breakup. It hasn’t been a bad gig. I got all the benefits with none of the drama. It was all I wanted until Piper walked back into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s not ready to forgive me, and I don’t deserve a second chance. I should just leave her alone, but after seeing her smile, I can’t do that. I’m done being the rebound guy. Piper doesn’t know it yet, but I’m going to do everything in my power to make her love me again. This time, I’m not letting her go.</description>

  <description>I’ll never forget the first time I saw Nora Fisher. The way my heart sped up in my chest and blood rushed through every part of me. I was drawn to her the moment our eyes met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was beautiful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guarded. &lt;br /&gt;Damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never meant to hurt the only woman I’ve ever loved. She was light, and I was dark, casting shadows on everything around me. Letting her go meant spiraling back into the darkness only Nora could pull me from. But I’d sacrifice myself a thousand times for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years later, she’s back, and the passion she ignites makes the fight for her stronger. But the more I try to make things right, the more I realize how complicated things have become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I'm starting to see that maybe her light was never meant to be mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Coming Feb 1st, 2018**&lt;br /&gt;Free Fall is a standalone, contemporary romance.</description>

  <description>"An unexpected evil brings both the MC and Military world together in this brand new series by J.M. Walker" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His demons are loud. &lt;br /&gt;Held captive within his mind, he does everything he can to forget his life before Vice-One. &lt;br /&gt;As one of the newest recruits, his main goal is to have his “brothers” trust him and he’ll do just about anything to make that happen. Until one passionate night with Creena Chan, the military was all he had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s hiding from her past. &lt;br /&gt;A trained professional, she keeps that part of her life to herself. The darkness weighs heavily on her chest, mixing with the beats of her heart, caused by the one man she tries to ignore. Vincent Stone is nothing like she imagined. Months of flirting lead to an explosion she never saw coming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only when Creena and Stone’s limits are tested, do they realize exactly what they will do to find that peace their family and friends deserve.</description>

She knows bikers and isn't scared of what this life entails. But when an unknown threat torments the club, can Techie’s sharp mind protect her from their faceless enemy, or is there an even greater enemy outside of the club that could tear them apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Previously published as Taken by Techie ***</description>

  <description>My name is Mad Dog.&lt;br /&gt;I’m the President of the Virginia Satan’s Savages MC. &lt;br /&gt;I’m a crazed man with nothing left to fight for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Amelia.&lt;br /&gt;My life’s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;All because of my ex-husband and his goddamned motorcycle club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early days, Mad Dog and Amelia were undeniably happy. Their life in the club together, along with their three young boys, was bliss. That was until one fateful night their world turned upside down. Having their lives torn apart pulled them in opposite directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mad Dog is trying to run a club that’s deteriorating, and all he can think of is the family he once had and lost. With the club broken, his family gone and his brothers turning on him, Mad Dog is running the Savages in a direction no one could foresee. He’s becoming crazed. But will the war with the Cartel lead him down a path that will leave everything irreparably damaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Previously published as Meltdown of Mad Dog ***</description>

  <description>Thump.&lt;br /&gt;That's what my heart did when I saw her.&lt;br /&gt;The vivacious lead singer of the world-famous band, Luminous.&lt;br /&gt;Effa's bubbly, quirky, and she's about to rock my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While going on tour with an all-female rock band should be intriguing, I've left someone behind. Someone so important it could be the difference between life and death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lines are blurred, jealousy flares - Effa sets my pulse racing, and she's going to change everything.</description>

  <description>My name is Stealth.&lt;br /&gt;A man torn in two opposing directions.&lt;br /&gt;I'm an undercover cop infiltrating the Satan's Savages MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Skye.&lt;br /&gt;I'm a club girl.&lt;br /&gt;This is the life I know, but I long for something simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Hannah.&lt;br /&gt;I am alone.&lt;br /&gt;The wife of a man who is never here, a ghost in the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going undercover forced Stealth and Hannah into a separation. Their marriage left in tatters. Throwing himself into his new identity as Stealth - bad boy biker of the Satan's Savages MC club - plunged him straight into the arms of club girl, Skye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the Cartel on the club's back and danger at every turn, can Stealth truly turn on the brothers he loves. Will he give his&lt;br /&gt;Unit the intel they need, putting his career before his brothers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it be the club, Skye, or Hannah, who is Stung by Stealth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MC novel contains crude language, sex scenes, and graphic violence. It is not suitable for readers under the age of 18. If any of the above offends you, please do not read any further. This is a complete work of fiction and is not a true representation of a motorcycle club. It is for entertainment purposes only. I hope you enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a work of fiction. Names and characters are the product of the author’s imagination and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead is entirely coincidental.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ahhhh!!! Loved this one so much. I just love the relationship between Flame and Steel so much!! The fire between them is amazing and the trust they have for each other as well. It is always nice to see the teddy bear under the armor but also the understanding of the rolls they play in their lives...]]>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;He wasn’t meant to be on my radar, he was definitely the off-limits guy. &lt;br /&gt;My brother’s best friend, my friend’s ex, but most of all he was my boss. &lt;br /&gt;Hawk Carnage resembled one thing, and one thing only. Sex. &lt;br /&gt;He used it, he knew it, he lived it. Hawk owned the largest lingerie company in the world, and I was his leading lady. &lt;br /&gt;In business. &lt;br /&gt;But now business and friendship were about to be crossed. The lines blurred, and I was ready to dip my toes in the forbidden water. Because no matter how much I said I could refrain from Hawk Carnage, now was not the time. &lt;br /&gt;He was to be my fake fiancé. &lt;br /&gt;And I was about to sink into that forbidden water, with Hawk’s hands clutching my sides. &lt;br /&gt;Lord help me because I was about to enjoy every moment of it. &lt;br /&gt;Even if it was just for fun. &lt;br /&gt;Even if it would ruin everything. &lt;br /&gt;I was going to dive in head first.</description>

  <description>I didn’t know darkness and evil lurked inside me until I had to murder in order to survive. Forced to become my own worst enemy. With so much blood on my hands, I was surprised I could still see my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;I killed.&lt;br /&gt;I tortured.&lt;br /&gt;I loved…&lt;br /&gt;I played God while I was rotting in Hell. Thriving on control and power was the only way I knew how to live. There were no other options.&lt;br /&gt;If you weren’t my friend, you were my foe.&lt;br /&gt;If you weren’t with me, you were against me.&lt;br /&gt;Traitors, as I called them. There were no imaginary lines. I’d crossed them all. No boundaries. No second chances. No redemption.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;For them.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Only for her…&lt;br /&gt;She loved me. Always convinced I was a saint, never believing I was just another sinner.&lt;br /&gt;A fucking monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, I didn’t choose this life. It. Chose. Me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Things are going to get...complicated. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asher loved her then. &lt;br /&gt;Landon loves her now. &lt;br /&gt;Then...they both fell for each other. &lt;br /&gt;Does that make them enemies or lovers?&lt;br /&gt;One thing's for sure—it's going to get complicated. &lt;br /&gt;See why readers are calling the Complicated Hearts duet "An unconventional, New Adult romance unlike any other."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Book Two (the &lt;b&gt; final&lt;/b&gt; book) of the Complicated Hearts Duet. Book One must be read first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is not for everyone. These characters are flawed and the situation is intense and frustrating. Emotions—all of them—run high. If you're looking for perfect characters and a perfect story...this book isn't for you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Breslin&lt;/b&gt;—I was in love with Asher Holden the moment I saw him...and I knew nothing would ever be the same. &lt;br /&gt;Then he hurt me. He wrecked me. He ruined me. &lt;br /&gt;I spent three years putting myself together—fixing what he broke.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I'd see him again after that day. &lt;br /&gt;I was counting on it. &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know—life had other plans...and things were going to become a lot more complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asher&lt;/b&gt;—I finally know who I am. I own it, I embrace it...I'm no longer afraid. &lt;br /&gt;I live my life with no regrets now, because I've learned my lesson—the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had it all figured out. &lt;br /&gt;But then my past collides with my present...and things become complicated.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out I don't really know myself after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Landon&lt;/b&gt;— My life was all mapped out. &lt;br /&gt;I knew exactly what direction I was heading in—I didn't have time for any roadblocks or obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;Then I meet her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; him. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my heart is split right down the middle. &lt;br /&gt;She controls the rhythm. He controls the melody. &lt;br /&gt;Complicated doesn't even begin to cover it...and there's only one way this can end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story is for mature readers only, due to language and sexual themes. This story contains explicit content featuring m/f, m/m, m/f/m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trigger Warning: &lt;br /&gt;This story is strange and unconventional. It's everything you hate. That's the only warning I can offer you.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the mother’s former nurse, the little half-brother isn’t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there’s Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn’t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her—until she discovers that he’s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that she’s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.</description>

  <description>STACY &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meeting Cade Matthews changed my life in so many ways. He's sweet, funny, very handsome, and as loyal as they come. He's been more patient with me than I ever thought a person would be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When things turn my whole world upside down, he is there to put them right again, if I'd only let him. I can't let him see what keeps me up at night because I know that once I do, he'll never look at me the same way again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believe in my heart that he is the only one who can put my pieces back together, but will entrusting Cade with all of me heal or break me completely?</description>

  <description>My siblings refer to me as the responsible one. I've had a set plan for my life for as long as I can remember, and everything I've achieved up until now was to help me reach that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally where I wanted to be, until a sexy as hell brunette crossed my path. Without even trying, she's made me aware that my life wasn't as complete as I'd once believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the other part of me I didn't know I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will things beyond our control or imagination tear us apart, or give us what we both never realized we needed?</description>

  <description>NOEL &lt;br /&gt;I never knew starting my freshman year in high school would change my life the way it did. The moment I saw her, I knew I had to be near her, to have her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never dreamed she would choose me. Her beautiful smile made everything better, made me whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I lost her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've given her time, and now I'm going to claim what's always been mine.</description>

  <description>Xana &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've never needed a guy to be happy. A few close friends were all I really needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment we met, he was all I could think of. I let him into my world more than anyone else, giving him all of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes life doesn't go according to plan. Sometimes we're left picking up the pieces. But even broken, I'll never stop loving him.</description>

  <description>GAVIN&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing in my life has always been baseball. The sport has always been a constant for me, the one thing I focused on above everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I met her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never dreamed I'd find someone who supported my love of the game. I didn't expect to fall for her like I did. Especially, since she was off limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes life comes at you like a hard line drive, daring you to catch it. In the end, I have no doubt I'll be the one catching Mallory.</description>

  <description>STACY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Cade Matthews changed my life in so many ways. He's sweet, funny, very handsome, and as loyal as they come. He's been more patient with me than I ever thought a person would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When things turn my whole world upside down, he is there to put them right again, if I'd only let him. I can't let him see what keeps me up at night because I know that once I do, he'll never look at me the same way again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in my heart that he is the only one who can put my pieces back together, but will entrusting Cade with all of me heal or break me completely?</description>

  <description>What if I was to tell you, you’re all evil? &lt;br /&gt;In some shape or form, you are. &lt;br /&gt;What If I was to tell you, I was the worst kind of evil? &lt;br /&gt;Would you believe me? &lt;br /&gt;I did not believe that there wasn’t anyone who didn’t contain evil. &lt;br /&gt;I was proved wrong, and it stumped me. &lt;br /&gt;I became obsessed with her, someone of pure goodness. &lt;br /&gt;And couldn’t get enough. &lt;br /&gt;I needed to see her insides because that’s what I do. Tearing people apart, I have to prove my point. I wanted to split her apart, to find any trace of bad. &lt;br /&gt;It was wrong of me to think like that. &lt;br /&gt;Though if death is all you know, is it so wrong? &lt;br /&gt;My name is Death. Her name is Pollie. &lt;br /&gt;And I want to see her insides. &lt;br /&gt;Just to understand if she is as pure as she makes out to be.</description>

  <description>Things heat up, and not just the Georgia summertime, when Dane and Laney go head to head over plans for her new duplex. But Laney's got his number, and knows just how to coerce her bossy, domineering man. Spend the summer with the gang and find out...just how many is a crowd? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The members of the Evolve Crew are getting older; so is the content. Mature audiences recommended.</description>

  <description>A heart is something that should not be entrusted to me. &lt;br /&gt;I will tear, crush, and destroy it with my very own hands. &lt;br /&gt;Then back away with a smile on my face. &lt;br /&gt;It’s who I am—a killer, a player, a joker. &lt;br /&gt;But hers, I’m unsure about. &lt;br /&gt;Do I want to rupture and rip it from her chest? &lt;br /&gt;Or do I want to hold and capture it with my own?</description>

  <description>To break a heart is easy. &lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is reach in, wrap your blood-covered hands around it, and pull. &lt;br /&gt;This happened to me. &lt;br /&gt;Two hands, both red as my hair, did this exact thing. &lt;br /&gt;Tore it away like it wasn’t made for me. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was his to take? &lt;br /&gt;Because years on, with those same blood-red hands, he still has it. &lt;br /&gt;In his clenched fists. &lt;br /&gt;And he won’t give it back. &lt;br /&gt;But the real question is, do I want it back? &lt;br /&gt;He is dangerous, uncontrollable, and downright sexy. &lt;br /&gt;I fell for it all, but in the end, he didn’t catch me. He let me fall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Standalone*</description>

  <description>Dating is hard. &lt;br /&gt;Dating online is hard. &lt;br /&gt;Dating online in your thirties is hard. &lt;br /&gt;Dating online in your thirties after being in a ten-year relationship is hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s not hard? &lt;br /&gt;Meeting men who aren’t really single.&lt;br /&gt;Having your time wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Receiving unsolicited pictures of genitalia.&lt;br /&gt;Said genitalia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When did dating become so complicated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to find a nice, good looking man who replies to my entire text message and doesn’t text me “WYD” every hour. I just want to find a fun loving, intelligent man who doesn’t have a Master’s Degree in Cheating and isn’t fluent in lies. I just want to find a man who is actually the height he listed in his dating profile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped back into the dating scene with tempered expectations. I didn’t think all the men I would meet were going to be amazing, but I didn’t think so many of them were going to be disasters.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;He’s a priest and I can’t stop fantasizing about him in ways no woman should.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temptation grows and my knees ache as I pray for the attraction to vanish. My words to the higher power seem to evaporate in the hot desert air the same way my safety in this new small town is about to expire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting him is constant.&lt;br /&gt;Needing him is intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;Resisting him is impossible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, except when it’s poisoned. And if my past catches me here, committing the unforgivable sin may not be the only reason I go straight to hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living a life where lies are necessary, mistakes are fatal, and sins unforgivable, has its limits, even for a former cop on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;This forbidden love story will test your limits and is intended for mature audience only. While Sin With Me can be read as a stand-alone novel, the author recommends to read it after reading Run With Me.</description>

  <description>**For a LIMITED time, &lt;em&gt;Bad Things (Book 1)&lt;/em&gt; is included along with &lt;em&gt;Battle Scars&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;em&gt;Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is in front of &lt;em&gt;Battle Scars&lt;/em&gt;, so the books can be read in order. Please use the table of contents to navigate to &lt;em&gt;Battle Scars&lt;/em&gt;** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say time heals all wounds, but sometimes it does just the opposite. The pain festers, seeping deep into your heart. By the time you’ve realized what happened, it’s too late and you’re left with a scar that will never go away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent the last year hiding my scars, running from the man who gave them to me. What I thought was love turned out to be a nightmare that won’t end, even though I forced myself awake. Love isn’t real. Love only leads to heartache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then I met him, the epitome of tall, dark and handsome. Throw in some sexy confidence and a panty-melting grin, and you have the recipe for a broken heart. Only, my heart is becoming full again, being put back together piece by piece the more time we spend together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been down this road before and know it’ll end in two ways: we’ll ride off in the sunset together and live happily ever after, or we’ll crash and burn so hard neither will survive the wreckage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want to be hopeful, but history is damned to repeat itself. And I have the scars to prove it</description>

  <description>Words have consequences. For some, more than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling novelist Emma Ross isn’t satisfied being number two. She wants to be number one. She can’t stand always looking up to Jessen Blake – an amazing writer – but also a dead one. She vows that her next book will top the charts no matter what it takes. But after repeated encounters in her dreams with Jessen Blake himself, warning her that she must never become number one, Emma drives herself harder than ever to top him. But as her grip on reality starts to unravel, she begins to suspect that her words may have more power than she could possibly imagine.</description>

  <description>Asists are machines, imitations of human life. But can their feelings be artificial when they seem so real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this collection of four stories, C.E. Wilson introduces readers to a time before Rogan fell in love with Chloe, before Bree met Fitz and before Monica hated Asists…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cocky brat finds out there are worse things her father can do than cheating on her mother… A lonely country boy in the city finds a friend where he least expected it… A tiny Asist who’s been through hell and back gets more than she imagined with a kind owner… and a young woman realizes that there’s more science than fiction when it comes to activating an Asist for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of clean science fiction romances, This is Then. delivers a quick glimpse back into a word where Artificial Intelligence not only exists amongst people, are hidden amongst them as well.</description>

  <description>She was everything, yet she was nothing. &lt;br /&gt;She was there, then she wasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t expect her, never wanted her. &lt;br /&gt;But there she was, everywhere yet nowhere. &lt;br /&gt;She drew me in with her looks. Locked me with her first words, then stole me with her lust. &lt;br /&gt;She was everything I didn’t know I was searching for, yet nothing I needed. &lt;br /&gt;She was a conundrum, difficult and confusing. &lt;br /&gt;One who was impossible of staying away from. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A kiss could bond you, taint you, claim you. If you let it, it could own you. &lt;br /&gt;A kiss from a stranger was highly unlikely. &lt;br /&gt;A kiss from a man who hid himself from me, yet slowly tormented me, was unlike any other kiss. &lt;br /&gt;It was the kiss of death. &lt;br /&gt;It was my hands in cuffs chained to his waist. &lt;br /&gt;And only he could set me free. &lt;br /&gt;How could I be so blind? How could I have let a man that was delicious as sin take a grip on me? No matter how hard I tried to pull, those cuffs stayed glued to him as the wall that stood between us. &lt;br /&gt;I had to smash that wall, I had to see the truth. &lt;br /&gt;Even if we collide. Even if he’s my own savage collision. I have to be set free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part one of the Savage Love Duet. &lt;br /&gt;Part Two Releasing May 29th.</description>

  <description>Book 6 in The Manhattanites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of ABC’s Revenge and VH1’s Celebrity Rehab comes UNCENSORED, a full length stand alone contemporary m/f erotic romance on how two wrongs can make a right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Content Warning: The detox of a wealthy heiress and an ego maniac leads to dirty talk, hate-fin’g, exhibition, bondage, jealousy, paddling, excessive wetness, forgiveness and love.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sobriety is in vogue this season when Debauchery magazine founder Vive Farnworth trades in her Park Avenue mansion for a halfway house. Enjoying “therapy” on a tomato farm she relearns how to live. Her focus on fruit soon ripens when a new roommate moves in. He’s dominant and challenging, and she swears his orgasm-enducing body looks familiar. Then again, her memory is one gin martini blur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stripped of his Olympic gold medal, Roddick “The Grunt” Beckstrong was the #1 professional tennis player in the world until a certain news outlet exposed him for doping to enhance his performance. After losing custody of his son to his ex-wife, along with sixty-five million dollars, he’s out for revenge against the owner of the tabloid that ruined his life—Debauchery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To destroy his nemesis…he’ll entice her mind, seduce her soul and satiate her body’s lust. Then he’ll publicly humiliate her! Falling in all-consuming love along the way wasn’t part of his plan, but it happens. When Vive learns of Roddick’s motives, she ups the ante with the one thing he hadn’t obliterated, her heart. It’s a vengeance that he never saw coming. Whoever stays sober the longest may win something their fame and fortunes never gave them before—a chance at happiness.</description>

  <description>It’s been nine years since I last saw Dante Santiago. I always had the biggest crush on Dante. That wasn’t easy either. He was always around, being that our families were so close. Dante was always the sweetest, most handsome guy I’ve ever seen. I was hoping to outgrow this childhood crush, but I’ve never stopped thinking about him. I’d hope that when I came home and saw him for the first time, those feelings would be done, or at least diminished, but no such luck. He is even more handsome than I remember. He was a fifteen year old boy when I left. Now he’s a man, and hot as hell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demi Mitchell is, my best friend, Madoc’s little cousin. Her father is Digger, the President of the motorcycle club we belong to, so I’ve known Demi her whole life, and I’ve always considered her family. I’ve missed her very much since she left for school. Now she stands before me, all grown up…gorgeous. And God help me, the last thing I want to think of her as is family. If Digger even suspected the thoughts I am having about his little girl, he would kill me, along with her brother, Drew, another one of the clubs senior officers. Not to mention her Uncle Frank, the Vice President, and of course Madoc. Hell, my own father wouldn’t be too happy with me, either. But I can’t stop thinking about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Demi and Dante fight the feelings they have for each other? Or will they defy their families and the MC to be together?</description>

  <description> There’s three things I love: my crew, my ship, and sinking my torpedo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted to serve my country for life, but then my ship blew up. Now I’m stuck on indefinite shore leave, holed up in my hometown with no crew, no ship, and definitely no women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until, after five years, &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; walks back into my life . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tabitha Peterson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shabby Tabby, the beautiful girl from the wrong side of the tracks. She didn't have money for fancy clothes, but Tabitha still caught every eye in a hundred mile radius - &lt;strong&gt;especially mine.&lt;/strong&gt; Back then, I’d have done anything to catch her - with zero luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'd always wondered where she ended up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I know - because she’s in my house, the caregiver sent to tend to me. I’m broken, maybe forever, but she’s more tempting than ever, with her crazy curves and big, beautiful eyes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I go from being bored stiff to having the challenge of my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have two missions: learn to walk again, and get Tabby where I've wanted her all this time. &lt;strong&gt;In my arms and in my bed.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We can do it lying, sitting, or standing on one leg - I don’t need both legs to show her a good time. I just want to tear her walls down as I tear her clothes off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When they fall, I’m not prepared for what comes next. How badly she's been hurt… or how badly I want to protect her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I'll risk everything to make her mine, &lt;i&gt;for good.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Torpedo is a stand-alone novel with a guaranteed HEA and no cheating!*&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Poppy &lt;br /&gt;Love and war. Two words that should have little association, but to me the two go hand in hand. Both are a tragedy. They rip you open and spit you out. The war killed my husband, Connor, shattered my will to live, and took my best friend. Brandon may not have physically died in that war, but his soul did. And now we're left to pick up the wreckage. Expected to move on when all that is left is the ruins of a life we once had. &lt;br /&gt;Brandon &lt;br /&gt;War. It took everything from me, even myself. When you're only able to exist, death seems like a blessing. Pain...a welcome distraction. I ran from everything associated with my past, and then she found me, fighting, drowning myself in whisky, trying to forget. She reminds me of Connor, of what I've lost—what we've lost. In the midst of destruction, she's a salvation I don't deserve. &lt;br /&gt;I shouldn't love him. &lt;br /&gt; I shouldn't love her. &lt;br /&gt; Love is a war we never should have fought. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My life is a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single, working, and raising two daughters, it's a miracle I get us up, dressed, and fed every morning. Forget about dating--nobody's got time for that. Even if love hadn't left me jaded, I'm not settling for anything less than perfect this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for me, the perfect man just happens to work in my office. But there's just one small problem: he's my boss, and is totally off limits. But hey, if it's meant to be, it'll find a way, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a night out with friends turns into a night in with the walking-talking bad boy cliche of a bartender. It's just one night. No harm, no foul, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except when the hot bartender turns out to be my boss's trouble-making brother, who wants more than just one night with me. The more I resist the spark between us, the more I find myself wanting him too. Which puts me in the middle of what could be the biggest sibling rivalry of the century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, love is even messier.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

A man who was so lovesick, I was afraid he would drown me in that same ocean he was lost in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Standalone***</description>

  <description>Malcolm Davenport is serving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a remote island in Alaska, Malcolm is part of Project Isolation, where he must reflect on the crime that cost him the only thing he ever loved. He spends his days and nights alone, with his thoughts and his art—drawing the woman he lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his isolation comes to a strange and abrupt halt when a miniature winged woman with pink hair and striking blue eyes comes literally crashing through his cell and his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Verity Nine a fairy? A sophisticated spy drone? She’s says she’s a human, and she just might be the answer to the pardon he’s so desperately wanted. But at what cost? The closer Malcolm gets to Verity, the less he sees a fantastical creature or a robot—what he sees is a woman for whom he might be willing to sacrifice it all.</description>

  <description>No feelings. &lt;br /&gt;No lies of calling the next day, and no empty promises of not banging anyone’s mother. &lt;br /&gt;If I could act like I’ve never met a set of twins I screwed on the same night, thinking they were the same person, then I could do this. &lt;br /&gt;It was the perfect set up for a fake relationship and it was simple. &lt;br /&gt;We faked our smiles, we faked our laughs; hell, we even faked our love. It wasn’t real. &lt;br /&gt;But that kiss was anything but fake, and the orgasm was anything but pretend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somehow my plus one had become more, and now I’m standing here with my underwear around my ankles wondering what in the hell to do next.</description>

  <description>Love and loss. &lt;br /&gt;Passion and pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been a fan of Edgar Allan Poe because his work epitomized how one can be driven mad by the truth and freedom of those emotions. So, when I needed to put the finishing touches on my doctoral research on Poe, I returned to my hometown of Richmond, VA—a place Poe also considered home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, I could’ve gone anywhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jackson Parker was back in Richmond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best friends since we were twelve, JP was my support system. Separated by life but connected by technology, our relationship always had a flirty undercurrent, but it wasn’t sexual. Although our attraction was mutual, our affection was platonic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it wasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know when it happened. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know why it happened. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know how it happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But love and loss, passion and pain collided in September and when I found the truth in the madness, that set me free.</description>

  <description>Love can thaw the fiercest winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a society where elves are no longer creatures of myth and magic, Brynne Mirren is just trying to survive the holidays as one of Santa’s Rejects. Loyal to her duty as the eldest child, she stands outside in the freezing cold and sell matchbooks—not that anyone would buy anything from an elf. Each fruitless day is the same without exception until her path crosses with Carter Holly. Persistent though he is, she can’t help but wonder if he has an ulterior motive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, very few humans look kindly on elves these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days before Christmas, Brynne’s life takes a drastic turn and she is forced to trust the gentle stranger in the darkest time of her life. Carter Holly continues to surprise her, stirring up new feelings within her with every act of kindness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the threat of freezing along with her matchbooks is very real, Brynne can't forget that falling in love with a human is even more dangerous.</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling Author M. Robinson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once read that every warrior hoped an honorable death would find him. I always went looking for mine, but not even the Reaper wanted me.&lt;br /&gt;I was trained to kill. I was trained to not ask why. To take orders and just march in line. Hooah motherfucker. &lt;br /&gt;Life or death.&lt;br /&gt;Ride or die.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m not only talking about the military. I’m talking about the life that led me on the road to nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;My life.&lt;br /&gt;I fought for my brothers. &lt;br /&gt;I fought for my family. &lt;br /&gt;I fought for my country. &lt;br /&gt;And I fought for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never realizing I might die for them too.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Speeding toward ecstasy with two insanely hot alpha guys and one strong woman who is struggling to keep it all together...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CORA MILLS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Cora Mills, keeping her family out of trouble is a full-time job. Her family is a mess and she's always been the one to bail them out. She longs for an escape. Two gorgeous men from her past offer just that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her high school boyfriend Jet is now the president of a motorcycle club which has been known to dabble in criminal activity. Her old friend Leo is the town sheriff. The two men are as different as night and day, but both of them make Cora burn with desire. If she can’t choose one... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JET KERR&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A crime spree has the county on edge. Authorities think the local M.C. is behind it, and Jet must prove not only his own innocence, but that of his brothers in the club. But his craving for Cora is a distraction. His complicated friendship with Sheriff Leo is a problem, too. His heart races for them both. They can’t outrun desire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEO STONEY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leo is certain Jet and Cora know more about the crimes than they let on, but his lust for them can’t get in the way of doing his job. Is he in bed with the enemy? If he doesn’t restore law and order, everything he stands for will be put at risk, but love threatens to conquer all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Road Hard is an extremely steamy, ultra high heat standalone bisexual menage / motorcycle club romance with alpha bad boys, explicit MF, first time MM straight to gay and MMF scenes and an explosive HEA ending!&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Every student at Shame U has their secrets, and Henley Brooks is no exception. Struggling to pay for college and maintain her perfect reputation has become overwhelming. When her friend Gigi Oxford offers her a night of carefree fun, she can’t pass up the opportunity to unwind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a night of drinking turns to chaos, Henley finds herself alone with Lucas Young, a student from London who has come to America to unravel a few secrets of his own, as well as break a few hearts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covered in tattoos and drowning in liquor, Lucas was everything Henley should avoid but couldn’t resist. She soon begins to fall for him like the many women before her. But after stumbling across something he didn’t want her to see, she learns that Lucas may not be who she thinks he is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henley and Gigi devise a plan to teach Lucas a lesson, but it isn’t long before Henley learns that no one at Shamus Thornton College can be trusted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When everything begins to feel like it is falling apart, there is only one person Henley wants to pick up the pieces, even if he is the person who caused her to crumble.</description>

  <description>My name is Tobias Thomas Sheffield. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like to tell you a story about the girl &lt;br /&gt;who changed my life forever. &lt;br /&gt;This is deeper than a love story, &lt;br /&gt;this is a connection that most never find; &lt;br /&gt;something that occurs once every few lifetimes or so. &lt;br /&gt;I was written in her, she was written in me, we were written in the stars. &lt;br /&gt;Before you invest your time in our story, &lt;br /&gt;I should warn you. If you don’t believe in love at &lt;br /&gt;first sight or you rely on an unbending system &lt;br /&gt;to give your life a false sense of security and meaning, &lt;br /&gt;you should probably skip our story. &lt;br /&gt;On the contrary, if you can get to know us with an open mind, &lt;br /&gt;pretend for a little bit that you may have been &lt;br /&gt;systematically lied to your entire life, &lt;br /&gt;then my hope is that Tristan will have the same impact &lt;br /&gt;on you as she did me. I’m a better man because of her, &lt;br /&gt;and I hope that you find something potentially life-changing in her as well. &lt;br /&gt;She made me someone I didn’t know I wanted to be. &lt;br /&gt;For her. For me. For humanity. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A standalone contemporary romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my husband Oliver died, my life ended. My purpose, my passion, my everything bled out with him on the side of the Pacific Coast Highway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ollie was an organ donor. His eyes, his brain, his lungs, his heart... parts of my Ollie went out and saved lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then his heart, beating in another man's chest, found its way back to me, and I found myself faced with an impossible choice: hold on to the pain and beauty of the past and the memory of the man I loved, or reach for a bold new future, knowing each heartbeat will be a reminder of all I've lost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*   *   * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn't supposed to live past thirty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My grandfather died at forty-five. Heart failure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My father died at thirty-eight. Heart failure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The doctors told me my whole life that I wouldn't see my thirty-first birthday. My heart was going to give out. It was just a matter of time: a rare blood type and an unusually large heart meant essentially zero chance of a transplant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I proved them all wrong... by dying on my thirty-first birthday. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then I woke up, alive, with another man's heart inside my chest, and his widow on my conscience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I spent my whole life preparing for death, and now I have to learn how to live. Only, as I soon discovered, living is the easy part. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loving, and allowing myself to be loved... well, that's a whole lot harder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a standalone second chance romance like you've never read before.</description>

  <description>Can be read as a &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who’s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she’s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you’re gonna’ hate my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It’s not the “I can do anything, now that I’ve found you/I’m misunderstood but one day you’ll find me irresistible because of it” tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I’m a complete witch. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I’m every girlfriend’s worst nightmare and every boy’s fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Sophie Price...And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

  <description>When Nikki Janicek sprints from the 200-degree sauna out into the 100-below darkness wearing nothing but bunny boots, at least she’s not alone.&lt;br /&gt;She already has survived months of solitary confinement, a forced swim with sharks and a scary journey to the South Pole. Now she’s a member of The 300 Club, an exclusive group of people on the planet who have endured a 300-degree temperature swing in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;It’s all part of her training for a six-person, one-way mission to Mars.&lt;br /&gt;Nikki wants to go, but not with The Bridge — a space-obsessed company that abducts, controls and violates people.&lt;br /&gt;She wants to take a stand.&lt;br /&gt;She wants to free her father, her former lover and herself.&lt;br /&gt;And she’ll attempt it with the help of the young man who shot her seven years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It’s a previously inconceivable alliance, bonded by polar extremes.</description>

  <description>Eighteen is hard. &lt;br /&gt;And so is Mateo Alesci. &lt;br /&gt;Hard to read, hard to predict, hard in every way that counts. &lt;br /&gt;He wants things from me. &lt;br /&gt;Dirty things, nasty things, forbidden things. &lt;br /&gt;And I have to give in. &lt;br /&gt;His attention is completely inappropriate, but I can’t say no. &lt;br /&gt;The way he looks at me… the way he watches me through my bedroom window… the way he drags me deeper and deeper into his completely forbidden fantasy just… turns me on. &lt;br /&gt;He knows it turns me on. &lt;br /&gt;He holds all the power. He holds all the cards. He holds my entire future in his hands. &lt;br /&gt;And I have to give in. &lt;br /&gt;Because Mr. Alesci is my teacher. &lt;br /&gt;And I need everything he’s offering.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Things a good neighbor can do for you:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Give you a cup of sugar &lt;br /&gt; 2. Let you borrow his lawnmower &lt;br /&gt; 3. Water your plants while you're on vacation &lt;br /&gt; 4. Make your eyes roll back in your head with his tongue &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katya Tocci&lt;/b&gt; has never paid much attention to who lives next door - her career always kept her too busy. She's a good girl, working her way to becoming the most sought after cake designer in all of San Francisco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even a good girl's gotta cut loose once in a while, right? So one fake dating profile later, and she's ready to tarnish her squeaky clean image. Little does she know, her fun time is closer to home than she ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Throw in a neighbor who wants to corrupt her, and another who just wants to own her, and her entire world is flipped upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who knew neighbors could be so helpful?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;This story contains scenes of a graphic sexual nature, multiple uses of coarse language, and one scene of violent cake destruction. Reader discretion is advised&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>At 8:28 I was the girl who had everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 8:29 my whole world fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A split second can change your life. I learned this the hard way. I wasn't ready to let him go. Even when the terms "vegetative state" and "will never recover" were thrown around I held onto hope. I mean, miracles happen, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We deserved our happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later and I'm still hoping. In my heart I know I have to let him go but how can I? He's the only man I've ever loved. He"s my soul mate. My life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I meet Max. He's everything Aiden isn't and as much as I'm trying to fight my feelings, I'm losing. I don't want to fight anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to live my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in order to move forward I need to let go of the past.</description>

He has no time for love, which is totally dandy until a tiara-clad Helena drops into his arms at a European airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet Gunther,&lt;/b&gt; a groom with a shady agenda. &lt;b&gt;Helena,&lt;/b&gt; his bride, has the coldest feet in the universe.

Cue her escape to Florida. Cue her new job as a Hooters girl. Cue her side job as a ring girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, Gunther is hellbent on tracking down his bride (read: his prize), while Victor battles his new obsession (aka, the love of a lifetime?) Let the dramedy of epic proportions begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A book in the MMA Fighters duet.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller! In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. “&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the “perk” and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable. &lt;b&gt;Now an AT&amp;amp;T Audience Original Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; WINNER OF THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Eleven. A name. A title. A sentence passed. If you aren’t a Beauty, you’re less than a person. You’re a commodity known as a Potential… and you only have so many chances to qualify as a human being. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her seventeen years, Eleven has seen the best and worst in humanity. She’s been passed around and abused by the bad. She’s hoped and dreamed for the good. And she’s despaired for the hand she’s been dealt. Now she’s been purchased by a wealthy man who has the ability to improve her life and help her become a Beauty – if she can put up with his erratic and controlling personality for long enough, that is. Complicating things is the appearance of a stunningly beautiful young man with amethyst eyes who treats Eleven to the rarest form of attention for a Potential: kindness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does Eleven trust her powerful owner to help her escape this life of servitude and enslavement, or does she gamble everything on the enigmatic young man who seems to offer her more than she could ever imagine possible? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A GIRL TRYING TO LEAVE HER PAST BEHIND&lt;br /&gt;I was a normal teenager who loved music and dancing, until the day I was attacked in my favorite record store. A few years later when my mom succumbed to depression and took her own life, I couldn’t stay in my hometown with all the memories and the curious stares. I decided to get in my car and just go – except my car decided it was done going outside a tiny place called Evergreen Grove. That’s where I found Jake. Or I guess Jake found me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GUY WHO CAN’T LET HIS GO&lt;br /&gt;For the last eight years, all I can think about is the day I ended another man’s life. Then I manage to save Cassie’s, and I feel like maybe I’ve got some kind of second chance. To do what I couldn’t before, or maybe even for something bigger. Something like love. If only I could feel like I deserve her...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brand new stand-alone novel by Bestselling author Ellie Danes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON SALE - THIS WEEK ONLY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ayden King has no one to blame but himself. He took the fall for his best friend and after fifteen years in prison, he’s finally out and determined to turn his life around. Locked up when he was barely 18, he went in a nice, innocent kid, and came out a hardened bad boy with an attitude. But Ayden never expected that living on the outside would turn out like this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn Bishop worked her way to the top. She doesn’t have time for games or players, but that’s exactly what she’s surrounded herself with at her job and when Ayden King stumbles into her life she finds herself turned off and turned on at the same time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conviction is a steamy, bad boy romance filled with twists and turns. Perfect for fans of Kelly Favor, Hannah Ford, M.S. Parker and Claire Adams.</description>

  <description>"I can't go home. It's not safe. Nowhere is." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess Eckhart isn’t crazy. She’s not suffering from psychosis. She and Luka Williams are part of The Gifting. Before they can find out what that means, the man with all the answers turns up dead. The only thing he left behind? A few patient files that lead to the nation’s most lawless city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With authorities chasing them, Luka and Tess escape into the very heart of peril and against all odds, find an underground community of people just like them. They aren’t gathered together for the sole purpose of survival, either. They have a plan and a purpose—to awaken as many people with The Gifting as possible. It’s dangerous and deadly work. Tess wants to help. Luka is desperate to keep her safe—a task that proves increasingly difficult as Tess’s gifting comes to light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could Tess Eckhart be the One they’ve been waiting for? The One who can save them all?</description>

  <description>"Darkness is a tricky thing. Especially when it cloaks itself in light." Luka isn't dead. He's not beyond saving. Tess knows because she saw him with her own eyes. After what she saw, she's sure of one thing: If they don't rescue him soon, Luka won't be Luka anymore. If only she could convince the other members of the hub. They're not sure Tess saw what she claims she saw. And they're preoccupied by the fact that their kind is being systematically eradicated. Answers lie in an ancient prophecy, one that revolves around a seventeen-year-old girl who never asked for any of this. K.E. Ganshert's final installment in The Gifting Series brings readers on an action-packed journey through loss, sacrifice, betrayal, and the impossible choice between what we want most and what we know is right.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; If science is right, then I am crazy. And crazy is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess Eckhart has always felt things nobody else can feel. Then the Ouija board incident happens at a high school party. Her complete freak out sends her family across the country--next to a nationally-renowned facility for the mentally ill. Worried Tess suffers from the same illness that tormented her grandmother, her parents insist she see a psychiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess is more concerned about fitting in at her new school, and hiding the fact that she's seeing a therapist at the Edward Brooks Facility. She's used to whispers and stares, but when it comes to Luka Williams, a reluctantly popular boy in her class, she's unused to a stare that intense. Then the headaches start, and the seemingly prophetic dreams that haunt her at night. As Tess tries to hide them, she becomes increasingly convinced that Luka knows something--that he might somehow be responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if she's wrong? What if Luka Williams is the only thing separating her from a madness too terrifying to fathom?</description>

  <description>When I opened my eyes, I was in a cell, my body covered in bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d been kidnapped and imprisoned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t alone. I shared the cell with Garin Woods, the man I’d loved since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man I couldn’t be with because of the secret. A man who would kill me if he found out what that secret was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone wanted to torture me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torture us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of us deserved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t Garin.</description>

She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. ‘Jess and Jason’, she calls them. Their life – as she sees it – is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train…</description>

  <description>She was a ghost, in heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was there, then she wasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She would play with my emotions like a well-played guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she would disappear. Making me want to strangle her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe she wasn’t a ghost, maybe she was the giver of sin. Because we sinned every time we touched, every time she was near. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her lips were shaped like a heart, deceiving you at every word. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her body was created straight from my fantasies, one I craved to bend to my will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her heart, well, who the hell knew. She kept that shit locked tight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I couldn’t find the key.</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>Hunted, shot, and without her memory, eighteen-year-old Ann Baker wakes in shallow water on a deserted Pacific Northwest island. She is soon approached by two young men claiming to be her friends. Something isn’t right, but when gunshots sound, Ann is left with little choice but to allow Devon and Archer to help her escape. Soon she finds herself in their North Bend mountain compound, where the higher evolved humans claim to be mind-readers. While Ann heals, she realizes they believe her to be one of the last and most powerful of all – The Lost One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s welcomed by most with opened arms, but not everyone is happy about her arrival. A jealous adversary has plans for Ann, which spirals the entire Reader community into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As lies, murder, and betrayal threaten to rip apart the once harmonious mountain dwellers, Ann is thrust into making a decision that could save or devastate not only The Readers, but all of mankind. But there’s just one glitch: by doing so it may require her to make the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>The twisty, gripping number one bestseller from Richard and Judy Book Club winner Clare Mackintosh, author of I Let You Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Richard and Judy Summer Book Club 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zoe Walker sees her photo in the classifieds section of a London newspaper, she is determined to find out why it's there. There's no explanation: just a grainy image, a website address and a phone number. She takes it home to her family, who are convinced it's just someone who looks like Zoe. But the next day the advert shows a photo of a different woman, and another the day after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a mistake? A coincidence? Or is someone keeping track of every move they make...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Shari Lapena, Paula Hawkins, Rachel Abbott, B A Paris, Fiona Barton, Ruth Ware and CL Taylor, you'll love this gripping psychological thriller.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of The Girl on the Train, The Silent Wife, and Gone Girl comes an enthralling psychological thriller that spins one woman's seemingly good fortune and another woman's mysterious fate through a kaleidoscope of duplicity, death, and deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Ron Howard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The request seems odd, even intrusive - and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live. But none of the apartments she sees are affordable or feel safe. Until One Folgate Street. The house is an architectural masterpiece: a minimalist design of pale stone, plate glass, and soaring ceilings. But there are rules. The enigmatic architect who designed the house retains full control: no books, no throw pillows, no photos or clutter or personal effects of any kind. The space is intended to transform its occupant - and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a personal tragedy, Jane needs a fresh start. When she finds One Folgate Street, she is instantly drawn to the space - and to its aloof but seductive creator. Moving in, Jane soon learns about the untimely death of the home's previous tenant, a woman similar to Jane in age and appearance. As Jane tries to untangle truth from lies, she unwittingly follows the same patterns, makes the same choices, crosses paths with the same people, and experiences the same terror as the girl before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 59 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Karen Brown’s most hypnotic novel to date--gothic-inflected psychological suspense that unmasks the secret desires of a young woman with a mystical gift&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the family homestead by the sea where she grew up, Martha Mary saw ghosts. As a young woman, she hopes to distance herself from those spirits by escaping to an inland college town. There, she is absorbed by a budding romance, relieved by separation from an unstable sister, and disinterested in the flyers seeking information about a young woman who’s disappeared—until one Indian summer afternoon when the missing woman appears beneath Martha’s apartment window, wearing a down coat, her hair coated with ice.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;I was ruthless. &lt;br /&gt;I was feared. &lt;br /&gt;I had sacrificed. Myself. Her. Everything... &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in a world where I was worth more dead than alive was a choice. I was a bad man, never claimed to be anything else. I’ve done things I’m not proud of. Seen things that can’t be unseen. I’ve caused pain that I can’t undo. &lt;br /&gt;It was all my choice. &lt;br /&gt;Every decision. &lt;br /&gt;Every order. &lt;br /&gt;Right and wrong never mattered. &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt;She was under my protection, until she became my obsession. &lt;br /&gt;But who was going to save her... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From. Me. The devil himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate brought us together. Destiny destroyed us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;STANDALONE. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Full length novel.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

(Five Seven Five &amp;amp; Five Seven Six) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Frost has only ever known the darkness. Everything outside of her closed society is The Unknown – a strange and dangerous place accessible to only a chosen few. White’s only glimpse of the world beyond comes from her beloved cousin in the form of mysterious collections of words that hint at astonishing wonders. When an accident upends her simple existence, she’s given an unlikely chance to see the truth for herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she finds is greater and more terrible than she could have imagined, and before long she is forced to make the most important choice of her life: does she accept her safe, limited world that she’s known or take a desperate gamble in a world not meant for her with the Boy with Words?</description>

  <description>The cattiness.&lt;br /&gt;The fights.&lt;br /&gt;The shaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't generally watch reality television, but I definitely don't watch reality dating shows. Besides the fact that it's completely staged, it's a horrible depiction of people -- women especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women are pitted against each other to compete for the affection of a man they "fall in love" with after a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;I call B.S.&lt;br /&gt;It is complete crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my best friend, Koko, was hired as a makeup artist o the set of the most popular reality dating show, The One, I teased her mercilessly.&lt;br /&gt;She told me that if I didn't stop teasing her, she would get me back.&lt;br /&gt;And she did...&lt;br /&gt;Which is how I ended up as a contestant on The One.</description>

  <description>The insta-love.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect couple.&lt;br /&gt;The enchanted fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of ‘happily ever after’ on reality TV is beautiful, but it’s complete B.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I get the appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One is the most watched reality TV dating show because it sells the idea that two people “randomly” handpicked by producers will fall in love and ride off into the sunset. We are expected to believe that after having a group of women embarrass themselves for the affection of a man on national television, the bachelor and the chosen one fall in love and they live happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shows like The One are really about fantasy romance and must-see entertainment—not happily ever afters. That’s why the creators and producers don’t show what happens after the exotic getaways, lavish lifestyles, and over-the-top proposals. Even though reality TV relationships never last, they want us to buy into the fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is… when the cameras stop rolling, the number one killer of reality TV couples is real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And life just got REAL.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>Amelia died writing the word grid. Richard froze to death. The thirteen year-old twins, Delilah and Trevor were hanged with a jump rope. Four year-old Oliver was peeled. They never found that other girl. &lt;br /&gt;Thirteen college students, and two goats, pick this murder house to spend their weekend. They’re having a murder mystery party, and what would be more fun than hosting it at an actual haunted house? &lt;br /&gt;Soon the murders are all too real, and the locked door in the basement is rattling and unlocking. Grab the two goats and get the heck out of there! But escape is impossible. Will they survive the guesthouse?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The perfect family. The perfect house. The perfect life. All gone now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could cause a man, when all the stars of fortune are shining upon him, to suddenly snap and destroy everything he has built? This is the question that haunts Sergeant Ryan DeMarco after the wife and children of beloved college professor and bestselling author Thomas Huston are found slaughtered in their home. Huston himself has disappeared and so is immediately cast as the prime suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeMarco knows—or thinks he knows—that Huston couldn't have been capable of murdering his family. But if Huston is innocent, why is he on the run? And does the half-finished manuscript he left behind contain clues to the mystery of his family's killer? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A masterful new thriller by acclaimed author Randall Silvis, &lt;em&gt;Two Days Gone&lt;/em&gt; is a taut, suspenseful story that will break your heart as much as it will haunt your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Dean Hayes has always fought in the shadow of his identical twin, Lincoln.&lt;br /&gt;Climbing the ranks of professional MMA is his entire life, he’s never once stopped to forge anything meaningful outside of the octagon. Instead, he’s fixated on unrequited feelings for a woman who only ever used him for her own end.&lt;br /&gt;After ten years hoping for a miracle, holding onto his hopeless fantasy could cost Dean his one shot at true love…and he doesn’t even know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Josie Cunningham left her dead end job to become the Public Relations manager for the hottest pair of fighters in the AUFC—the Hayes Twins—she never knew how wild the ride was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;Dean has been thorn in her side from day one, constantly pushing her buttons…including the one right over her heart. Bending the rules and none the wiser for her secret attraction, he tears at her self-control until she snaps under the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;When Josie decides to act on her feelings, her world is turned upside down… And she’s thrown right in the path of the storm of the century with no way to shield her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the middleweight title up for grabs, all’s fair in love, war…and the octagon.</description>

  <description>Kane “Rebel” Sturgess is the newest fighter at The Underground, an illegal cage fighting racket that’s bad news…and big money. He’s set to make his fortune with the only thing he’s ever been good at. Fighting dirty.&lt;br /&gt;He’s got no job, no family, no ties and this is his ticket to an easier life. Winning a Championship in this place could mean better and more honest things for a guy like him.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Charlotte “Charlie” Croft, undercover detective with the Victoria Police, tasked with bringing an end to The Underground. She’s got her work cut out for her considering most of her fellow cops are taking bribes on the side from the ringleaders. The only chance she’s got is if she heads in undercover and immerses herself in the life. She needs to get close to her targets, collect evidence and pounce…all without being found out.&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t expect is to fall for one of the fighters. A handsome, dangerous, bad boy with a rap sheet longer than War and Peace. A fighter who goes by the name Rebel.&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one thing he’s interested in cracking, and it isn’t The Underground. It puts Charlie in an impossible position and she’s got to make a choice before she winds up in a body bag.&lt;br /&gt;Her heart or her career. She can’t have both…or can she?</description>

  <description>All Josh “Steel” Caplin ever wanted was a little bit of glory…until he was left for dead on the street outside a hospital ER.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing he remembers is being beaten to a pulp at The Underground, the illegal cage fighting ring that’s bad news, but the only place he feels he belongs.&lt;br /&gt;When he finally wakes up, he stares right into the eyes of an angel and for the first time wonders if there’s something more out there for a guy from the wrong side of the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;When Dr. Holly Walsh finds an unconscious man on the street, she stakes her claim over her patient for better or worse. When he finally opens his eyes, she isn’t prepared for how deep that claim is about to run.&lt;br /&gt;They both have pasts they’d rather forget, but together they’re stronger…if only they’re strong enough to fight for each other.&lt;br /&gt;Can a bad boy fighter and a big time surgeon really make things work?&lt;br /&gt;Or when their two words collide, will it be sirens…or sparks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEEL is the fifth full length novel in the bestselling Beat/Pulse series from Amity Cross.&lt;br /&gt;Time to fight for the broken hearted…</description>

  <description>Violet Fuller has been through a lot in her short life.&lt;br /&gt;After being viciously attacked, she’s hidden herself away from the world for the past five years, fearing everyone and everything. That’s until the day she finally gathers the courage to go outside.&lt;br /&gt;Violet decides to take a job at her brother Ash’s new gym, Pulse, to reacquaint herself with the male dominated world of MMA. She used to be her brother’s biggest supporter, going to all his matches and cheering him on. There’s no one he trusts more to help him run the admin side of his new business, but when Violet walks through the door for the first time, she sees someone she wasn’t expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Handsome, AUFC fighter, Lincoln Hayes.&lt;br /&gt;The same Lincoln Hayes that she’s had a crush on since she was sixteen.&lt;br /&gt;All muscled, disciplined, hot as hell, six-foot two of him. He’s definitely not a boy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Things are about to become more difficult than Violet had hoped. So much for easing back into reality.&lt;br /&gt;And Lincoln? He’s only got one thing on his mind.&lt;br /&gt;How do you win over a woman who is afraid of everything?&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br /&gt;You fight.</description>

  <description>Ren Miller never dreamed her life would turn out quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the cusp of qualifying for the brand new woman's UFC league, she's finally found the thing that makes her tick. She finally has a whole new life before her, but it’s one that doesn't include Ash Fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has seen or heard from Beat's Golden Boy in six months, not even Ren. He's disappeared off the face of the earth and he's just another person who's ended up abandoning her when she needed him the most. He broke her heart, but he took the one thing that was hers. Her spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone unexpected turns up at Beat with an ultimatum, Ren must make a decision. Go after Ash and her own heart or make her Dad's dream of winning a Championship come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ren choose to fight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or sacrifice everything to save the man she loves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;18+ due to mature sexual content.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Moment&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Five Days&lt;/i&gt; comes “the best book about Morocco since &lt;i&gt;The Sheltering Sky. &lt;/i&gt;Completely absorbing and atmospheric” (Philip Kerr).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin knew Paul wasn’t perfect. But he said they were so lucky to have found each other, and she believed it was true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a meticulous accountant, almost forty. He is an artist and university professor, twenty years older. When Paul suggests a month in Morocco, where he once lived and worked, a place where the modern meets the medieval, Robin reluctantly agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once immersed into the swirling, white hot exotica of a walled city on the North African Atlantic coast, Robin finds herself acclimatizing to its wonderful strangeness. Paul is everything she wants him to be—passionate, talented, knowledgeable. She is convinced that it is here she will finally become pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Paul suddenly disappears, and Robin finds herself the prime suspect in the police inquiry. As her understanding of the truth starts to unravel, Robin lurches from the crumbling art deco of Casablanca to the daunting Sahara, caught in an increasingly terrifying spiral from which there is no easy escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his acclaimed ability to write thought-provoking page-turners, Douglas Kennedy takes readers into a world where only Patricia Highsmith has ever dared. &lt;i&gt;The Blue Hour&lt;/i&gt; is a roller-coaster journey into a heart of darkness that asks the question: What would you do if your life depended on it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ben&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those gold eyes were the first thing I noticed. I wanted more than anything to get lost in them, drown in her, to let go of my fears and doubts my past had left behind.&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn’t just me I had to consider.&lt;br /&gt;My son came first.&lt;br /&gt;She's a force to be reckoned with, though. She was everywhere, in my dreams even, tempting me to throw caution to the wind.&lt;br /&gt;And I was weak.&lt;br /&gt;I gave into my clawing desire and let myself enjoy one night with her, having no clue she’d change me forever.&lt;br /&gt;Once wasn't enough. I became addicted. I craved her – her scent, her skin, her smile, her eyes…her love.&lt;br /&gt;I &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; Samantha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Samantha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life was uncomplicated. It was free and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Then I met him, the man with the blue-violet eyes that entranced me.&lt;br /&gt;I had a feeling I was making a big mistake when agreeing to one night of carnal bliss, but I was unable to walk away. I just couldn’t have foreseen how big of one it was.&lt;br /&gt;He turned my world upside-down, working his way into my heart until it beat only for him. Now everything is complex, and there are secrets he’s not telling me.&lt;br /&gt;Will he ever let me in?&lt;br /&gt;Time would tell, but one thing is sure – I’d walk through hell and back, feel the blistering lick of each flame against my flesh, for just the promise of Ben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not intended for anyone under the age of eighteen due to language and sexual content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note from the author:&lt;br /&gt;Fated Bliss is the second book in The Bliss Series, and though it is recommended to read Finding Bliss first, it’s not needed. Fated Bliss is a standalone novel with an HEA.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Clara&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One phone call was all it took. A voice on the answering machine, a man oblivious to what calling me would do, uprooted my entire existence. He revived old hurts, dug up past nightmares. He destroyed everything I’d built for myself.&lt;br /&gt;But I found bliss through Grey, in Grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that making a simple phone call, one that devastated me because of the reasons behind it, would make me question my truths, my friendships, everything I held dear in my little town. Calling her was the best and worst decision I’d ever made, but it brought her to me, to Bliss.&lt;br /&gt;And I could never take that back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding Bliss is a story about redemption, love, and finding true, irrevocable bliss. It’s about new beginnings and the heights attainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not intended for readers under the age of eighteen due to language and sexual situation.</description>

  <description>Everything changes, in seconds, minutes, hours. &lt;br /&gt;I know, it happened to me. &lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t for the better, it was for the worst. &lt;br /&gt;I am broken, no that doesn’t sound right, I am chipped. Pieces of me have been chipped so bad that it’s impossible to claim them back. Even if I want to, even if it's for her.</description>

  <description>"An unexpected evil brings both the MC and Military world together in this brand new series by J.M. Walker" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants to be alone. &lt;br /&gt;Nightmares from his past keep him guarded and afraid. &lt;br /&gt;Vice-One is his life. They’re his brothers—the only people who helped keep him out of his own head long enough to move on from the childhood he never asked for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His therapy has been protecting his country, barely taking a break before beginning his next mission. But no amount of training can prepare him for his great challenge yet—convincing Meeka Cline that she will be his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She wants out. &lt;br /&gt;Her world fell apart when King’s Harlots no longer trusted her, but she continues to fight to gain back their respect. &lt;br /&gt;All she wants is to help those wronged by the evil that has put a shadow on everyone she knows. &lt;br /&gt;Asher Donovan comes to her for help when he needs her most only to have passion flare up between them. One problem: He’s her best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Putting aside their friendship, they use the heat between them to please the depraved minds they now understand…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ashley Suzanne follows up &lt;i&gt;Raven &lt;/i&gt;with the next round in her scorching Fight or Flight series—the story of a damaged MMA fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, and the sizzling affair that forces him to grow up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Cutter Greer lives at the gym—literally. Abandoned by his parents as a teen, Cutter dropped out of high school and ended up on the streets. In a simple act of kindness, mixed martial arts trainers Garrett and Rian put him up in the apartment above their gym. Now he’s got a surrogate family and a shot at MMA stardom—but he still has a lot to learn about women. And he certainly isn’t prepared for the earth-shattering consequences desire can bring.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Josette Sandoni is pleasantly surprised by the night of unexpected passion she shares with hard-edged, hard-hitting Cutter. But then comes the shock of a lifetime: She’s pregnant. Even though Cutter clearly isn’t a ready-made father, his adamant denial of any responsibility still shakes her to the core. But, for the sake of their child, Josette fights for their future. She just needs to find the right moves to show her wounded warrior the true meaning of love.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for Ashley Suzanne’s &lt;i&gt;Raven&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Holy crap, Ashley Suzanne completely blew me away with this book. All I’m saying is ‘Read this book!’ It’s fantastic.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Erin Noelle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Ashley Suzanne shows her range in &lt;i&gt;Raven&lt;/i&gt; with a totally original plot line full of twists and turns.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author S.E. Hall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Ashley Suzanne hits it out of the park with this book. I could talk about how incredible it is all day long. Just go read it. Now.”&lt;b&gt;—K.D. Sarks, author of &lt;i&gt;Unexpected Change&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In the debut of Ashley Suzanne’s blistering-hot Fight or Flight series—perfect for fans of Monica Murphy and J. Lynn—two sparring partners put their hearts on the line and push their bodies to the edge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rian Fields is done being a punching bag. When Rian was thirteen, her only friend walked out on her, leaving Rian alone to mourn when she lost her mother three years later. Then he came back into her life senior year, igniting new desires—and breaking her trust permanently when he enlisted in the army. Now Rian has finally found an outlet for her rage against the world: mixed martial arts. But just as she’s learning the ropes, Garrett Rhodes turns her life inside-out one more time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As much they hurt each other, Garrett never got over Rian. So when he gets the call that she’s in jail, he bails her out, no questions asked. The years have toughened her. Made her harder. Sexier. All she needs to make it as an MMA fighter is the right coach, and Garrett’s man enough to train her. He just has to go toe-to-toe with “Raven,” the fearless woman who takes control in the ring . . . without falling for Rian, the vulnerable girl who still drives him crazy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.</description>

  <description>"An unexpected evil brings both the MC and Military world together in this brand new series by J.M. Walker"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He refuses to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;He was born alone and he will die alone. Or, at least he thought so until now.&lt;br /&gt;Vice-One is all he knows. His squad. His brothers. The men he spends every day protecting. He is empty and only one person can fill this void.

  <description>Hallie Clarke has been through the rumor mill so many times that she barely feels the sting of the lies anymore. With her impenetrable walls steady and in place, she leaves her infamous high school days behind and sets off for University of Michigan, with only her beat up, old guitar for company. Determined not to repeat past mistakes, Hallie vows to live her life differently and free from the rumors that can destroy a person so easily. &lt;br /&gt;Or so she thinks. &lt;br /&gt;It isn’t long before she attracts the attention of her too hot to handle neighbor, Nate Harris. She tries to fight her intense attraction to him, but with his sweet words and chiseled abs, her walls of ice begin to crumble around her. Hallie soon finds herself opening up to Nate, letting him in to her world of music, and sharing secrets she swore she’d take to the grave. &lt;br /&gt;The hot new romance causes more than a few heads to turn on campus, and old rumors begin to surface, threatening to pull them apart. Their connection is strong, but will it be enough to hold them together when the rumors take a dangerous turn? &lt;br /&gt;Or will Hallie be left to fight it all alone?</description>

  <description>Taking a chance on Gibson Barclay was something Chloe never envisaged in her future when she was in college. Years later, she found herself thrown into his world with no immediate way out. She knew that trying to be the girlfriend of Gibson Barclay would come at a price. Was she capable of trusting him with his notorious womanizing reputation and temptation only a heartbeat away? Chloe was still dealing with her own dark event, and with the media constantly thirsty for new information about Gibson and his life, it meant Chloe would be constantly watching over her shoulder, fearful of her past rearing its ugly head again. Gibson promised to protect Chloe, but how could he keep her safe from the past that still haunts her with his life in the spotlight? When Gibson's trust is put to the test how will he react?</description>

  <description>I was his lucky Penny. He was my light in the dark, hope in despair. Our bond was one of survival, friendship... first love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then we were ripped apart and Blake Weston became the memory I turned to when everything else in my life fell apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years later, a summer working at Camp Chance is supposed to be my fresh start. Beautiful scenery and the chance to better the lives of foster children - kids like me. But when my eyes land on him across the fire, time stands still and feelings come rushing back to the surface. I thought I'd moved on, tucked him away in my heart. One look into his soulful blue eyes and I know I'm wrong. Blake Weston can heal the broken parts of me. Restore my hope. Love me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's our second chance. A sign we are supposed to be together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was twelve when I survived the accident that killed my parents. Fourteen when I survived the devil. And sixteen, when I survived a heartbreak of the worst kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in my twenty-three years, Blake Weston might just be the first thing I won't survive.</description>

  <description>In the bestselling tradition of Jodi Picoult and written “in a style that’s as real as it gets &lt;i&gt;(USA TODAY)&lt;/i&gt;, this ripped-from-the-headlines novel features prosecutor Anna Curtis as she finds herself again at the center of a national story involving a freshman girl at a prestigious university who disappears after filing rape charges against a young man in a powerful fraternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma, a freshman at a Michigan university, has gone missing. She was last seen leaving a bar near Sigma Pi, the prestigious and secretive fraternity known on campus as “the rape factory.” The main suspect is Dylan Brooks, the son of one of the most powerful politicians in the state. But so far the only clues are pieced-together surveillance footage of Emma leaving the bar that night…and Dylan running down the street after her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Curtis is on the case when she discovers the video diary Emma kept over her first few months at college, exposing the history she had with Dylan—and accusing him of rape before she disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma’s disappearance gets media attention and support from Title IX activists across the country, but Anna’s investigation hits a wall. Now Anna is looking for something, anything she can use to find Emma alive. But without a body or any physical evidence, she’s under threat from people who tell her to think hard before she ruins the name of an “innocent young man.” Inspired by real-life stories, &lt;i&gt;The Last Good Girl&lt;/i&gt; shines a light on campus rape and the powerful emotional dynamics that affect the families of the men and women on both sides.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With its thriving military base, Seaside, North Carolina, is teeming with heroes of all stripes. But, as the Hero’s Welcome series from Annie Rains continues, it takes a cowboy to rescue the town’s newest resident from heartache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After a bad breakup leaves Julie Chandler completely devastated, she comes to Seaside seeking a fresh start. A talented, compassionate yoga teacher, she has developed a program to help alleviate the effects of PTSD, but getting a bunch of bullheaded Marines into downward facing dog might be impossible. So Julie’s shocked when one of her first students dives in headfirst—and almost tempts her to take down her walls with his easy smile and electrifying touch.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Ever since Texas cowboy turned Marine pilot Lawson Phillips lost a crew member in a helicopter accident, he hasn’t been able to fly. When a psychologist orders him to attend, of all things, a yoga class, Lawson’s outraged—until he finds out Julie is the instructor. She’s beautiful, graceful, and completely guarded when it comes to his advances, but he’s determined to find out what makes her tick. Because underneath Julie’s hard shell is a woman Lawson knows he could fall for—and he’s not ready for the ride to end.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If you love Kristan Higgins, Susan Mallery, or Jill Shalvis, you won’t want to miss the Hero’s Welcome military romance series! &lt;i&gt;Welcome to Forever&lt;/i&gt; introduces a small coastal town where America’s best and brightest risk everything for love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Seaside, North Carolina, there are two kinds of people: Marines, and kids of Marines. Then there’s Kat Chandler. Recently hired as the principal of Seaside Elementary, Kat makes it her mission to turn the school into a place of peace and calm. That’s not going to be easy with hard-liner parents like Micah Peterson storming in, telling her how to do her job—and then kissing her with those gorgeous lips of his and turning her brain into mush.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a Marine Sergeant and a single dad, Micah Peterson has just two priorities: doing his job better than anyone else, and getting the absolute best for his son, Ben. But when he meets Ben’s beautiful new principal, a different yearning shifts into focus. He wants her, sure, but he’s also moved by the connection Kat forges with her students. So after learning that she refuses to date Marines, Micah sets two more objectives: convincing Kat to give him a chance . . . and then holding on to her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Full of heart and emotion, don't miss this sparkling debut!" NYT bestselling author, Lori Wilde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A wonderfully written debut novel that had me fighting back tears and rooting for the couple from the first page. Annie Rains is an author to watch. I can't wait for more!”— USA Today bestselling author Sidney Halston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“WELCOME TO FOREVER is a beautiful and touching story of love and loss that will grab you by the heart and hold on long after you’ve finished reading.”—Laura Drewry, USA Today Bestselling Author</description>

  <description>Pain punished her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle numbed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt kept her trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dark alley of a pub, the words “Please don’t” take hold of her heart and break the silence she seeks. Thinking herself beyond redemption, she tentatively grabs on to the slim thread of hope that unfolds inside of her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding her secrets close, she can’t resist the comforting draw coming from The Skipper. The unconditional friendships it offers, the protective roof it provides, and the spark that its owner ignites in her—melting the frost off her heart, and slowly stripping away her resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; His life flows from one crisis to the next. Under the pressure of competition crowding him out of his family’s pub and the need to protect his children from the ruins of a bad marriage, he barely breathes. That is until a mane of strawberry-blonde hair and a set of big, pale blue eyes, shake him up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never expected the shadow of a woman he finds on the floor of his washroom to bring him the air―the balance and the light he’s been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to some content of a sexually explicit nature, this book is recommended for a mature audience only.**</description>

  <description>*100,000+ words* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Innocence marked her… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Violation crippled her… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love left her raw… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The life she carefully rebuilt is challenged when she is confronted with the sins from her past. The carefully applied protection is at once ripped away, leaving her exposed and vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her single night of indulgence with the silver-eyed stranger is only the beginning. He sees right to the heart of her and she is unable to ward off emotions that have been deeply buried. With the sting of betrayal still fresh in her soul, she’s surprised to find herself opening up to the honest integrity of the sharp-eyed, rough-looking biker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When he lost everyone who mattered, he was left without roots and learned to be content simply living in the moment. Completely unprepared for the feisty blonde bartender with old pain marring her clear-blue eyes, he questions his own rules of detachment, as she unwittingly finds a way under his skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Appearances deceive and when the masks fall away, revealing deep, dark secrets, there is nothing left but to hang onto each other and survive the storm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book deals with issues around abuse that might be sensitive to some.* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Due to content of a sexually explicit nature, this book is recommended for a mature audience only.** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>***STANDALONE SPIN-OFF in the BACK TO LIFE SERIES***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life made me resilient.&lt;br /&gt;Love made me vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt;Marriage made me… Emily Diaz. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I married the man of my dreams, I assumed it was forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when circumstances called for me to leave the man I loved, it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But betrayal changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;And everything happens for a reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in love with myself enough to walk away brought me back to life. &lt;br /&gt;Being in love with my life again brought me back to reality. &lt;br /&gt;Being in love with someone else, well, that brought me back to December.</description>

  <description>"An unexpected evil brings both the MC and Military world together in this brand new series by J.M. Walker" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He refuses to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;He was born alone and he will die alone. Or, at least he thought so until now. &lt;br /&gt;Vice-One is all he knows. His squad. His brothers. The men he spends every day protecting. He is empty and only one person can fill this void. This darkness. &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Genevieve Gold makes it clear he should stay away when she is everything he craves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She is lost. &lt;br /&gt;Her heart has been ripped out; stomped on...crushed into tiny pieces, leaving only a gaping hole behind. &lt;br /&gt;King's Harlots is all she has. Her club. Her sisters. Her life. But something is missing until he shows up. &lt;br /&gt;Angel Rodriguez is everything she hates but everything she needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Putting differences aside, they will work together to bring down a malevolent force threatening to rip them apart...</description>

  <description>Almost forty-one-year-old Annabelle Morris, wife to multi-billionaire record label executive Charles Morris of Zenith Productions, and mother of two is at a crossroads in her life.&lt;br /&gt;Separated from her husband after walking in on him having sex in the public restroom of a charity event she was hosting, she has arrived on the island of St. John alone and rejected, determined to re-evaluate her life and her marriage. She's tired of being her husband’s showpiece while he pretends she doesn't exist. She's tired of trying to make their marriage work for the sake of their two teenage boys. &lt;br /&gt;When she meets Johnny Lightning, a sexy but mysterious piano-playing, bearded sailor, she is tempted to break vows she has never before broken. But Johnny is much younger than her and seems to be hiding more than a few secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;From the laid-back sandy beaches of the Caribbean to the elite circles of Dallas high society, Annabelle is forced to make critical choices.&lt;br /&gt;Is a chance for happiness worth the risk of giving up the life she has always known?&lt;br /&gt;Worth jeopardizing her own and possibly even her children's future?&lt;br /&gt;In the end, will she stay on her present course or brave a new and uncharted one?&lt;br /&gt;Find Me, Remember Me, and Keep Me is a full and complete novel in three separate parts.</description>

  <description>Almost forty-one-year-old Annabelle Morris, wife to multi-billionaire record label executive Charles Morris of Zenith Productions, and mother of two is at a crossroads in her life.&lt;br /&gt;Separated from her husband after walking in on him having sex in the public restroom of a charity event she was hosting, she has arrived on the island of St. John alone and rejected, determined to re-evaluate her life and her marriage. She's tired of being her husband’s showpiece while he pretends she doesn't exist. She's tired of trying to make their marriage work for the sake of their two teenage boys. &lt;br /&gt;When she meets Johnny Lightning, a sexy but mysterious piano-playing, bearded sailor, she is tempted to break vows she has never before broken. But Johnny is much younger than her and seems to be hiding more than a few secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;From the laid-back sandy beaches of the Caribbean to the elite circles of Dallas high society, Annabelle is forced to make critical choices.&lt;br /&gt;Is a chance for happiness worth the risk of giving up the life she has always known?&lt;br /&gt;Worth jeopardizing her own and possibly even her children's future?&lt;br /&gt;In the end, will she stay on her present course or brave a new and uncharted one?&lt;br /&gt;Find Me, Remember Me, and Keep Me is a full and complete novel in three separate parts.</description>

  <description>On the outside my life seems simple. I'm an average woman with a love for motorcycles. A high school teacher who's a single mother. But what you don't know is what lingers just beneath the surface... &lt;br /&gt;The desires &lt;br /&gt;The needs. &lt;br /&gt;This hunger that can never be fully satiated. &lt;br /&gt;Part of me knows it's bad. That I shouldn't crave what I do. But the other half doesn't give a fu*k. &lt;br /&gt;I'm split in two. Which is how I've spent most of my life. &lt;br /&gt;Torn in half by conflicting emotions. By the man I desire, but shouldn't. By the secrets that I hide from almost everyone. &lt;br /&gt;Then... &lt;br /&gt;One day, everything changes... &lt;br /&gt;My world is turned upside down and I'm left falling... &lt;br /&gt;Falling toward something special. &lt;br /&gt;Toward a sense of belonging that I find in the strangest of places. With someone I never thought I'd be with in my wildest dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm Gwen Donovan and this is my journey to love and self acceptance. &lt;br /&gt;Let's just hope, that in the end, it doesn't bite me in the ass. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains shameless adult sexual content, taboo situations, graphic violence, profanity that'd make your grandmother blush, a woman who has multiple orgasms, a vast array of possible triggers including past sexual assault so expect anything. And whatever the hell else that makes it unsuitable for folks under the age of 18. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a Standalone. &lt;br /&gt;Part 1 of a Duology. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;81k Words in Length.</description>

  <description>Promises. &lt;br /&gt;We all make them. Sometimes we break them. But what happens when the promise you break haunts your dreams, when that moment of betrayal echoes within every last beat of your heart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love. &lt;br /&gt;Love is passionate, painful, and all consuming in the most brutal yet beautiful way. How many people have you said 'I love you' to? Five, ten, maybe no one? I've said that word to two men, but only one where I felt it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tragic. &lt;br /&gt;This word sums up my relationship with Nicolas: devastating, painful, depressing. &lt;br /&gt;A first love that should have lasted a lifetime, but I ruined with a stupid decision. Nicolas is my star crossed lover, and even though Shakespeare has taught me that stories such as ours always end in tragedy, I can't not love him, even if I'm married to someone else.</description>

  <description>We came from nothing and were given a second chance at life, and life was pretty good until it tipped on its axis and my world came tumbling down around me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Baby Sister is missing…&lt;br /&gt;Stolen…&lt;br /&gt;Lost… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never felt this helpless before now, the vacant hole inside me expanding with each passing second of not knowing where she is. &lt;br /&gt;What’s she going through? &lt;br /&gt;Is she hurt?&lt;br /&gt;Suffering?&lt;br /&gt;Alive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I learn of her disappearance the more fear implants itself inside my heart, hardening - darkening. &lt;br /&gt;The world is a depraved place, full of evil lurking behind normality.&lt;br /&gt;Behind smiles. &lt;br /&gt;Behind deception and facades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needs me and I will do whatever it takes to find her. &lt;br /&gt;Whatever. &lt;br /&gt;Whatever.</description>

  <description>Sadie Hunt isn’t perfect—but her husband is. Nathan Hunt has her coffee waiting every morning. He holds her hand until the last second. He worships the Manhattan sidewalk she walks on. Until one day, he just…stops. And Sadie finds herself in the last place she ever expected to be. Lonely in her marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rugged and sexy Finn Cohen moves into the apartment across the hall, he and Sadie share an immediate spark. Finn reveals dreams for a different life. Sadie wants to save her marriage. Their secrets should keep them apart, not ignite a blistering affair. But while Sadie’s marriage runs colder by the day, she and Finn burn hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Her husband doesn’t want her anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The man next door would give up everything to have her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slip of the Tongue is a standalone contemporary romance. The second book in the series, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30050787-the-first-taste" rel="nofollow"&gt;The First Taste&lt;/a&gt;, is a standalone about a different couple.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Roan Diamond’s loyalty to the family may be obligated by blood, but nobody ever said he had to love them all, right?&lt;br /&gt; As the next in line to head the Diamond dynasty, he has loose ends to take care of, and one of those is his brother Royal. Yet his plans for revenge fall apart the minute he lays eyes on Alina—Royal’s ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be the daughter of the rival Solokov family.&lt;br /&gt;As a mafia princess, Alina Solokov knew it wouldn’t be easy when she made the decision ten years ago to leave the family for a new life at a college in England—but betrayal is often a dish served cold by those who you love the most. Now, back in the United States after a job offer that she couldn’t refuse, her new found strength is pushed to the limits when Royal returns to claim her for his own.&lt;br /&gt; When the man who captures her heart amongst the chaos is front and center in a lifestyle she swore never to return to, can she hold her ground and fight being sucked back into the black hole that is the mafia underworld? Or will Roan’s love be worth the ultimate sacrifice?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Being crowned as royalty in Rosewood Academy’s secret society wasn’t in Bea Morrison’s plans…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A senior in high school, Bea’s life changed forever when a tragic car crash claimed her best friend’s life, leaving her devastated and alone. Now at Rosewood Academy of the Arts, Bea owes a debt. With her best friend no longer queen, it’s up to Bea to be fulfill the role until graduation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is nothing money can’t buy, including Crosley’s king status…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bea accepts her place as queen, the arrogant Crosley is quick to remind her of her royal duties. Obsessed with the era of the Tudors, Crosley insists they must consummate their relationship—but spousal duties aren’t what Bea signed up for. When she rejects Crosley’s proposal, his expectations twist into absolute obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sadistic mind makes for an expert stalker…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After graduation, Bea thinks the nightmare of Rosewood Academy is over. She’s pleasantly surprised to reconnect with the gorgeous Everett Thompson, a drummer for her brother’s band. As feelings from their past fling resurface, Bea hopes for a fresh start with the guy who got away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea’s hopes are shattered when she receives threatening texts from Crosley, who is still determined to collect his debt. And as Crosley continues to pursue her, a terrible tragedy proves he is even more dangerous than she feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Bea has learned one thing, it’s that life is too fragile, and it’s anybody’s guess who will make it out of this nightmare alive.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>As the president of the Sin City Outlaw Motorcycle Club, I fuck as hard as I ride and rarely go to bed alone. &lt;br /&gt;The women are fast and the violence is intense. &lt;br /&gt;I excel in both.&lt;br /&gt;People either respect me or fear me. I'm not arrogant. It’s just the truth.&lt;br /&gt;I was a king, reigning over Vegas without complication, until one gorgeous sheriff made everything fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;When I saw her, I became a Neanderthal, wanting nothing more than to be between those legs. &lt;br /&gt;I guess that’s where I went wrong, because my reality was shot to hell real fucking fast.&lt;br /&gt;One kiss caused her to step over that blue line.&lt;br /&gt;One night in her bed made me a traitor.&lt;br /&gt;And now… we’re both screwed.</description>

  <description>Not looking for love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow rules and restrictions. Only fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No feelings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever--not an option. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Flings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were all just a number. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dash Oliver and Willow Dane both shared the same philosophy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until a merger of sorts. Thrown together by fate or serendipity, was their connection... their chemistry... their compatibility enough to convince them that their rules were made to be broken and that they belonged together?</description>

  <description>I am loyal, but I will betray you. &lt;br /&gt;I am strong, but I have scars. &lt;br /&gt;I am an angel, but the devil. &lt;br /&gt;I met her when I was sixteen and she was a breath of fresh air. She swooped in, making me smile. But then she left, taking my next breath with her. &lt;br /&gt;Her smile could light up a room, making my black heart pitter patter. &lt;br /&gt;I found her again ten years later, with a syringe in her arm. &lt;br /&gt;Blood coming from between her legs. &lt;br /&gt;She was broken and I was glad she was broken. She wouldn't think less of me and my damaged ways. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;USA Today Bestseller&lt;/i&gt;, Vi Keeland, comes a sexy new standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I met Brody Easton was in the men's locker room.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first interview as a professional sportscaster.&lt;br /&gt;The famed quarterback decided to bare all.&lt;br /&gt;And by all, I don't mean he told me any of his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;No. The arrogant ass decided to drop his towel, just as I asked the first question. &lt;i&gt;On camera.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super Bowl MVP quickly adopted a new hobby--screwing with me.&lt;br /&gt;When I pushed back, he shifted from wanting to screw &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; me, to wanting &lt;i&gt;to screw&lt;/i&gt; me.&lt;br /&gt;But I don't date players.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not because I'm one of the few women working in the world of professional football.&lt;br /&gt;I'd date an athlete.&lt;br /&gt;It's the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; kind of player I don't date. &lt;br /&gt;You know the type. Good looking, strong, cocky, always looking to get laid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brody Easton was the ultimate player. &lt;br /&gt;Every woman wanted to be the one to change him. &lt;br /&gt;But the truth was, all he needed was a girl worth changing for. &lt;br /&gt;Turned out, I was that girl. &lt;br /&gt;Simple right? Let's face it. It never is. &lt;br /&gt;There's a story between once upon a time and happily ever after...&lt;br /&gt;And this one is ours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note - &lt;i&gt;The Baller&lt;/i&gt; is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Roan Diamond’s loyalty to the family may be obligated by blood, but nobody ever said he had to love them all, right? &lt;br /&gt; As the next in line to head the Diamond dynasty, he has loose ends to take care of, and one of those is his brother Royal. Yet his plans for revenge fall apart the minute he lays eyes on Alina—Royal’s ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be the daughter of the rival Solokov family. &lt;br /&gt;As a mafia princess, Alina Solokov knew it wouldn’t be easy when she made the decision ten years ago to leave the family for a new life at a college in England—but betrayal is often a dish served cold by those who you love the most. Now, back in the United States after a job offer that she couldn’t refuse, her new found strength is pushed to the limits when Royal returns to claim her for his own. &lt;br /&gt; When the man who captures her heart amongst the chaos is front and center in a lifestyle she swore never to return to, can she hold her ground and fight being sucked back into the black hole that is the mafia underworld? Or will Roan’s love be worth the ultimate sacrifice?</description>

  <description>*Mature Audience Only due to graphic sex and violence, a sexy Alpha Male and language.* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the Wrath unfold! Clubs. Mafia. Drugs. Murder. And the man they all know as Scarface, will leave you guessing in book one of this brand new series... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eloped at the age of eighteen. Separated at the age of eighteen. Disappeared at the age of eighteen. This is what happened to Calla Greer. Her perfect life was shattered on her wedding day when she caught her husband Cain with another woman just hours after they said I do. With her heart broken, she moves across the border to Windsor, Canada to get away from the nightmare she stumbled upon. Hell bent on going to college and fulfilling her dream of becoming a lawyer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six long years of still being married, Calla returns to Detroit to have Cain sign divorce papers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Cain has changed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s bitter, angry and for a good reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that’s what he’s been telling himself for the past six years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cain Bexley had fifteen minutes to destroy his marriage to protect the woman he loved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did the only thing he could think of to make her leave. He jumped in bed with a woman. Life at home was a lie. Lives were at risk. People are not who they seem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even Cain’s dad or Calla’s parents are who they say they are. When Calla shows up begging for a divorce. He shows her exactly who he is and no way in hell will he sign those papers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when six years later she returns? The only woman he has loved. A woman who has changed herself! When all the lies surface will she be able to forgive everyone she has trusted in her life or will Calla turn to the man who destroyed her?</description>

  <description>"The day Savannah was killed she was fifteen minutes late to meet me." So begins bookseller favorite Susan Strecker's second novel of twin sisters and the murder that left one twin behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savannah was the popular bad girl skipping school and moving quickly from one boyfriend to the next, so when she didn't meet Cady as promised, Cady wasn't surprised and the truth was Cady was already a bit mad at her. When Cady suddenly becomes short of breath she realizes Savannah is in trouble, but within minutes Savannah is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later Cady, now a bestselling author of suspense, spends her time interviewing killers, hoping each interview will help her understand what happened to her sister. Despite Savannah's death, the bond Savannah and Cady share has never been broken. Savannah still comes to Cady, but the clues her sister sends don't add up until a chance encounter while researching her latest novel provides a missing piece of the puzzle.</description>

  <description>L. E. Bross’s contemporary romance debut is a fun and sexy tale of unlikely lovers struggling to leave the past where it belongs—behind them—and embrace a bright future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie McAllister’s brand new copy of &lt;i&gt;Home Improvement for Dummies &lt;/i&gt;doesn’t even begin to cover the DIY advice she really needs: how to put the pieces of her life back together. Her cheating ex-husband’s insider trading scandal destroyed her family’s multi-million dollar company and left Mel with nothing but the run-down oceanfront cottage she inherited from her parents. Biscay Beach, Maine, seems as good a place to start over as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot-as-hell carpenter Eli Stuart understands new beginnings. Once a rising star in the art world, the former sculptor has been secretly carving out a new existence in the small coastal town ever since the sheen on his old life turned to rust. He’s willing to bet the feisty brunette in need of major home repairs has never lifted a tool heavier than a nail file—until Mel is racing the clock to make her ramshackle home fit for winter and, facing a near-empty bank account, decides she can do it all herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Eli offers Mel a deal: if she helps him with the renovations, he’ll cut the bill in half. Soon Mel and her damned home improvement book are driving Eli mad with an explosive urge to return to his studio and fire up his torch once more. His new work is crude and raw, and before long, he can’t keep his hands off Mel, either. But a muse from his past could ruin it all for the second time—if Eli and Mel can’t let go of who they used to be and trust their hearts with a do-over.</description>

  <description>Avery Melrose is used to having it all. So when her boyfriend cheats on her, she reacts like any spoiled rich girl-she freaks out and vandalizes his new truck, Carrie Underwood style. Now she's stuck with 300 hours of community service doing road-side garbage duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth Hunter just got out of prison, and after a few hundred hours picking up litter on the side of the highway, he can finally put his mistakes behind him. If he can string together some kind of existence, maybe it'll be enough to get his sister away from their stepfather, the man who sent Seth to prison in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A romance between these two is doomed from the start. Girls like Avery want castles and white horses, and Seth is no prince charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes, being around Avery makes Seth think he could make something of himself. Maybe even be worthy of a girl like her. It's just too bad real life gets in the way first, tearing these two apart before they have any chance of getting to Happily Ever After.</description>

  <description>Sparks fly like snowflakes when a klutzy but gorgeous novice crosses skis with a hot resort owner in this tempting tie-in to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kristen Proby’s popular &lt;i&gt;Love Under the Big Sky&lt;/i&gt; series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Douglas is on a practice run for her friend Cara Donovan’s bachelorette party ski weekend in Aspen. The problem is, despite living in rugged and picturesque Cunningham Falls, Montana, Grace is the clumsiest person ever born. To prepare for the trip, she is taking lessons at a local ski resort. She just prays that they have an ambulance on standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy hotelier Jacob Berkley is ready to play ski instructor, but he quickly discovers that the best place on the mountain for Grace is in the lodge with a hot toddy. Her sense of humor and easy laugh quickly pull him in, and soon he’s determined to help her get off the bunny slope for a fun vacation with her friends. He just didn’t expect their steamy chemistry to trigger an avalanche of desire straight to his heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He made a promise he intends to keep…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, Amber Benedict fell in love with Kale Riker and pledged to wait for him to return from the military. Even though she rarely hears from him, she’s steadfast in her belief: he’s coming home to her, and soon. Then the government tells Kale’s family that he’s missing in action, and they have given him up for dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kale Riker has been away from civilization and Amber for three long years. He’s been promised he can retire his commission when he completes his current mission, but now he’s seriously wounded and facing a long recovery. Worse still, security risks force a communications blackout, leaving him no way to let Amber know he's alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Amber hold out against an entire town pushing her to give up on love while Kale fights to get back home to her before Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously released on Entangled’s Flirt imprint - December 2012.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

I could no longer go back and I sure as fuck didn’t regret a single moment of it. I knew there would be hell to pay, I knew the wrath I’d be facing but I would willingly take the burns and scars just to have the love of my best friend's sister. &lt;br /&gt;If there is one person I’d willingly go to hell and back for it was… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lillian Ryder &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Standalone within a series.

  <description>Loving a biker and his adult film star brother came at a terrible price. Taken by a rival gang, beaten beyond recognition and sexually assaulted, Rachel Givens saw a chance to survive by claiming the identity of the other girl who was taken and killed. She spent months recovering from her physical injuries but still struggles with PTSD. Add her three-year-old autistic daughter to the equation, and Rachel (now Rae Simmons) has her hands more than full as she makes a new life for them in a quiet little town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her former loves walk into the restaurant where she works, it’s clear that the Colson brothers have come for more than the plate lunch special. Once Rachel gladly submitted to their domination, but she hasn’t been with a man since her ordeal. She has triggers and issues and a daughter whose needs come first. Cord and Cam don’t care whether or not Hannah is theirs. As far as they’re concerned, Hannah is Rachel’s and Rachel is theirs – and they’ll do whatever it takes to convince Rachel that they belong together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SECOND EDITION WILL BE RELEASED JULY 2018.</description>

      <![CDATA[Rachel's story is riveting and raw that you forget she's a mom raising a little girl while hiding in a small town. This story was so different from the others and I loved it more for that exact reason. Nia has truly taken these ladies and made them strong, independent, sexy and loved tremendously...]]>

  <description>Singer/songwriter Anna James is getting desperate. Even with a day job, money’s tight, and she’s wound tighter yet, having sworn off sex to reconcile with her mother who’s in chemo and her father who disowned her for her wild, wicked ways. No sooner than her psychic best friend predicts an end to Anna’s self-imposed drought, rock stars Jackson and Jacob Thomason come to town, with the dream of an indie album co-written with local American Indian flutist Nico White and his songwriting partner AJ McPherson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson and Jacob are attracted to Anna, who gives as good as she gets. Learning that Anna’s alter ego AJ puts the “twist” in Nico’s “tribal” music only makes them want her more. The part-Comanche Thomason twins need an album’s worth of songs. That means spending night after night, working closely, getting to know each other, learning how to co-create. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna’s never written music with anyone but Nico. They’re comfortable with each other. The Thomason twins, who perform as No Mercy, make her anything but. What’s a fangirl to do, when submitting to her rock star idols means exploring the darker side of passion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SECOND EDITION WILL BE RELEASED JULY 2018.</description>

  <description>Grace Murphy is the local psychic medium who dreams of her soulmates – the two men she reincarnates with time and again.  While reading at an Irish festival, she meets Nicolas White, a bisexual American Indian musician.  A shaman with visions of his own, Nico recognizes Grace from his last sweat lodge as the red-haired woman in the south.  Now that they've found each other, surely the third one will come soon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six months later they meet J.T. Santiago, an ex-Navy SEAL and former cage fighter who owns a gym and teaches mixed martial arts.  J.T. is a dominant, but he’s never had a male submissive and Grace and Nico are a package deal.  It’s a learning curve for all of them, with J.T.’s initiation into MMF and MM relations and Grace’s introduction to BDSM.  With Grace’s yin, J.T’s yang, and Nico’s center balance, the three of them come together as far as J.T.’s PTSD will allow, but forging a future means healing the past, however painful it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SECOND EDITION WILL BE RELEASED JULY 2018.</description>

She thinks she might have found it in San Francisco, but all that changes when she witnesses a terrible crime. She’s ready to pack up her things yet again, when a random encounter with a stranger keeps her in the city, giving her reason to stay after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until Ivy discovers that their encounter wasn’t random. Not at all…</description>

  <description>He's her kind of danger...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small-town-girl Cassidy Jones is a fast-driving, sharp-shooting, man-loving cop with a loud laugh. She's also really good at her job—a fact that is completely irrelevant to the good ol' boys at the station. So when a local mobster is murdered, and the Chief is forced to turn to Cassidy for help, she's excited to get the opportunity to prove herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the only reason she's going undercover is because she's one of only two female cops on the force. Still, it beats the hell out of writing parking tickets. There's just one little problem: she's falling hard for Lorenzo, the mobster's dangerously sexy brother—and possible murder suspect. With everyone at the station assuming she'll fail, Cassidy cannot act on her attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Cassidy's instincts lead her to a shocking suspect, her reputation isn't the only thing at stake.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Charlotte was a good girl.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and innocent, a debutante with her Daddy’s credit card and a fiancée who doted on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was destined for a perfect picture life in Charleston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until everything goes wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;EJ grew up with everything she could ever want, and bored as hell. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing surprises her and nothing ever changes, and she wants out—whatever it takes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting involved with Anthony Jacobs is probably the worst idea she’s ever had—and that makes it irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Charlie needs her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Orleans. Memphis. Vegas. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful girls who know just how to get exactly what they want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s all fun and games, sexy nights and wild parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you can only manipulate your way out of so much, and the body count is rising. When their past catches up, not even a pretty smile will get them out of trouble this time.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Mercedes Ayres has an open-door policy when it comes to her bedroom, but only if the guy fulfills a specific criteria: he has to be a virgin. Mercedes lets the boys get their awkward, fumbling first times over with, and all she asks in return is that they give their girlfriends the perfect first time- the kind Mercedes never had herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping what goes on in her bedroom a secret has been easy- so far. Her absentee mother isn’t home nearly enough to know about Mercedes’ extracurricular activities, and her uber-religious best friend, Angela, won’t even say the word “sex” until she gets married. But Mercedes doesn’t bank on Angela’s boyfriend finding out about her services and wanting a turn- or on Zach, who likes her for who she is instead of what she can do in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mercedes’ perfect system falls apart, she has to find a way to salvage her reputation and figure out where her heart really belongs in the process. Funny, smart, and true-to-life, FIRSTS is a one-of-a-kind young adult novel about growing up.</description>

  <description>"The day Savannah was killed she was fifteen minutes late to meet me." So begins bookseller favorite Susan Strecker's second novel of twin sisters and the murder that left one twin behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savannah was the popular bad girl skipping school and moving quickly from one boyfriend to the next, so when she didn't meet Cady as promised, Cady wasn't surprised and the truth was Cady was already a bit mad at her. When Cady suddenly becomes short of breath she realizes Savannah is in trouble, but within minutes Savannah is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later Cady, now a bestselling author of suspense, spends her time interviewing killers, hoping each interview will help her understand what happened to her sister. Despite Savannah's death, the bond Savannah and Cady share has never been broken. Savannah still comes to Cady, but the clues her sister sends don't add up until a chance encounter while researching her latest novel provides a missing piece of the puzzle.</description>

  <description>Not even the warning label on the experimental project could have prepared Jane Spears for the nightmare she would walk into when the Ashley Potter case landed in her lap. Deep inside the victim’s mind, Jane finds clues hinting at the worst crimes she has ever come upon. But the bread crumbs don’t lead anywhere, and in the waking light Jane discovers nothing is as she believed. The conspiracy goes deeper than she can reveal, and the crimes are too hideous to leave unsolved. But can she stop it all in time, or will she be sucked in—trapped by the deranged mastermind?</description>

  <description>Listen, listen to the wind and stone. &lt;br /&gt;Listen, listen to the sounds of old. &lt;br /&gt;Listen, listen as my hopes are drowned. &lt;br /&gt;Listen, listen to the sounds that bullets make of blood and bones. &lt;br /&gt;Where will you run today? &lt;br /&gt;How will you ever get away?” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a romance. This is a ride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blood and Bone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The hollow sound of a casing hitting the floor. &lt;br /&gt;The clicking of heels walking in a misty alley. &lt;br /&gt;The ability to tie a cherry stem with her tongue. &lt;br /&gt;A haunting song no one else knows. &lt;br /&gt;That's all that's left of Jane's memories. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What would you do if the life you lived was a lie, and everyone knew but you? &lt;br /&gt;Where do you run when there is no one on your side? &lt;br /&gt;Jane discovers that deep inside her mind there is a map. &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn't know is that there is also a man who will do anything to get it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what he doesn't know is that Jane hasn't always been honest about the things she remembers. &lt;br /&gt;There are paces inside of Jane that even she doesn't like to go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What would you do if the secret you kept was the only thing keeping you alive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But keeping it meant someone else had to die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don't miss out on the new dark read by Tara Brown!</description>
