  <description>Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In &lt;i&gt;How to be an Antiracist&lt;/i&gt;, Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Kendi weaves together an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. &lt;i&gt;How to Be an Antiracist&lt;/i&gt; is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Economist Bryan Caplan makes a bold case for unrestricted immigration in this fact-filled graphic nonfiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American policy-makers have long been locked in a heated battle over whether, how many, and what kind of immigrants to allow to live and work in the country. Those in favor of welcoming more immigrants often cite humanitarian reasons, while those in favor of more restrictive laws argue the need to protect native citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But economist Bryan Caplan adds a new, compelling perspective to the immigration debate: He argues that opening all borders could eliminate absolute poverty worldwide and usher in a booming worldwide economy—greatly benefiting humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a clear and conversational tone, exhaustive research, and vibrant illustrations by Zach Weinersmith, &lt;i&gt;Open Borders &lt;/i&gt;makes the case for unrestricted immigration easy to follow and hard to deny.</description>

  <description>The narrative drive of Stowe's classic novel is often overlooked in the heat of the controversies surrounding its anti-slavery sentiments. In fact, it is a compelling adventure story with richly drawn characters and has earned a place in both literary and American history. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme—the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.</description>

  <description>For centuries Christians have questioned why, if God is good and all-powerful, he allows us to suffer pain. C.S. Lewis sets out to disentangle this knotty issue, but adds that, in the end, no intellectual solution can avoid the need for faith.</description>

  <description>Nick Corey is a terrible sheriff on purpose. He doesn't solve problems, enforce rules or arrest criminals. He knows that nobody in tiny Potts County actually wants to follow the law and he is perfectly content lazing about, eating five meals a day, and sleeping with all the eligible women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Nick has some very complex problems to deal with. Two local pimps have been sassing him, ruining his already tattered reputation. His girlfriend Rose is being terrorized by her husband. And then, there's his wife and her brother Lenny who won't stop troubling Nick's already stressed mind. Are they a little too close for a brother and a sister? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an election coming up, Nick needs to fix his problems and fast. Because the one thing Nick does know is that he will do anything to stay sheriff. Because, as it turns out, Sheriff Nick Corey is not nearly as dumb as he seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pop. 1280&lt;/i&gt;, widely regarded as a classic of mid-20th century crime, Thompson offers up one of his best, in a tale of lust, murder, and betrayal in the Deep South that was the basis for the critically acclaimed French film &lt;i&gt;Coup de Torchon&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Slapstick&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; presents an apocalyptic vision as seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan (and last President of the United States), a wickedly irreverent look at the all-too-possible results of today’s follies. But even the end of life-as-we-know-it is transformed by Kurt Vonnegut’s pen into hilarious farce—a final slapstick that may be the Almighty’s joke on us all.</description>

  <description>Born of a terrible insomnia—"a dizzying lucidity which would turn even paradise into hell"—this book presents the youthful Emil Cioran, a self-described "Nietzsche still complete with his Zarathustra, his poses, his mystical clown's tricks, a whole circus of the heights."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Heights of Despair&lt;/i&gt; shows Cioran's first grappling with themes he would return to in his mature works: despair and decay, absurdity and alienation, futility and the irrationality of existence. It also presents Cioran as a connoisseur of apocalypse, a theoretician of despair, for whom writing and philosophy both share the "lyrical virtues" that alone lead to a metaphysical revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"No modern writer twists the knife with Cioran's dexterity. . . . His writing . . . is informed with the bitterness of genuine compassion."—Bill Marx, &lt;i&gt;Boston Phoenix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"The dark, existential despair of Romanian philosopher Cioran's short meditations is paradoxically bracing and life-affirming. . . . Puts him in the company of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard."—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly,&lt;/i&gt; starred review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is self-pity as epigram, the sort of dyspeptic pronouncement that gets most people kicked out of bed but that has kept Mr. Cioran going for the rest of his life."—Judith Shulevitz, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Esta obra poderosa y práctica es una de las más populares y queridas introducciones a la fe cristiana jamás escrita Mero Cristianismo reúne las legendarias charlas radiofónicas de C. S. Lewis que se transmitieron durante tiempos de guerra, charlas en las cuales él se proponía ""explicar y defender las creencias que han sido común a casi todos los cristianos de todos los tiempos."" Rechazando los límites que dividen las distintas denominaciones del cristianismo, C. S. Lewis ofrece una inigualable oportunidad al creyente y al no creyente para escuchar un argumento fuerte y racional para la fe cristiana. Esta es una colección de la genialidad de Lewis que aún se mantiene viva para el lector moderno y que a la vez confirma su reputación como el escritor y pensador más importante de nuestros tiempos. Mero Cristianismo es su libro más popular y ha vendido millones de ejemplares a través del mundo.</description>

  <description>Everyone in the small town of Central City, Texas loves Lou Ford. A deputy sheriff, Lou's known to the small-time criminals, the real-estate entrepreneurs, and all of his coworkers--the low-lifes, the big-timers, and everyone in-between--as the nicest guy around. He may not be the brightest or the most interesting man in town, but nevertheless, he's the kind of officer you're happy to have keeping your streets safe. The sort of man you might even wish your daughter would end up with someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the platitudes and glad-handing lurks a monster the likes of which few have seen. An urge that has already claimed multiple lives, and cost Lou his brother Mike, a self-sacrificing construction worker who fell to his death on the job in what was anything but an accident. A murder that Lou is determined to avenge--and if innocent people have to die in the process, well, that's perfectly all right with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Killer Inside Me&lt;/i&gt;, Thompson goes where few novelists have dared to go, giving us a pitch-black glimpse into the mind of the American Serial Killer years before Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and Brett Easton Ellis's &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt;, in the novel that will forever be known as the master performance of one of the greatest crime novelists of all time.</description>

  <description>How did humankind deal with the extreme challenges of the last Ice Age? How have the relatively benign post-Ice Age conditions affected the evolution and spread of humanity across the globe? By setting our genetic history in the context of climate change during prehistory, the origin of many features of our modern world are identified and presented in this illuminating book. It reviews the aspects of our physiology and intellectual development that have been influenced by climatic factors, and how features of our lives - diet, language and the domestication of animals - are also the product of the climate in which we evolved. In short: climate change in prehistory has in many ways made us what we are today. Climate Change in Prehistory weaves together studies of the climate with anthropological, archaeological and historical studies, and will fascinate all those interested in the effects of climate on human development and history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A novel that reads like science fiction but bristles with rich detail about how the next World War could be fought." —&lt;i&gt;Vice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A modern-day successor to tomes such as &lt;i&gt;The Hunt for Red October&lt;/i&gt; from the late Tom Clancy.” &lt;i&gt;–USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Will World War III Look Like? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ghost Fleet&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning imagining of a war set in the not-too-distant future. Navy captains battle through a modern-day Pearl Harbor; fighter pilots duel with stealthy drones; teenage hackers fight in digital playgrounds; Silicon Valley billionaires mobilize for cyber-war; and a serial killer carries out her own vendetta. Ultimately, victory will depend on who can best blend the lessons of the past with the weapons of the future. But what makes the story even more notable is that every trend and technology in book—no matter how sci-fi it may seem—is real.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The debut novel by two leading experts on the cutting edge of national security, Ghost Fleet has drawn praise as a new kind of technothriller while also becoming the new “must-read” for military leaders around the world.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A wild book, a real page-turner.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Ghost Fleet &lt;/i&gt;is a thrilling trip through a terrifyingly plausible tomorrow. This is not just an excellent book, but an excellent book by those who know what they are talking about. Prepare to lose some sleep.”—D. B. Weiss, writer of HBO’s &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“It’s exciting, but it’s terrifying at the same time.”—General Robert Neller, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Soccer fans love to argue about the tactics a coach puts into play — sometimes years later, they wake in the middle of the night and curse a decision Arsene Wenger or Alex Ferguson made in 2000 — and this pioneering study traces the world history of tactics, from modern pioneers—such as Johan Cruyff, Arrigo Sacchi — right back to the beginning, where tactical chaos reigned. Along the way, author Jonathan Wilson, an erudite and elegant writer who never loses a sense of the grand narrative sweep, explores the lives of the great players and thinkers who shaped the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brilliant work of historical detective work explains the tactical development and innovations of soccer and how geography, history, culture and politics also affected the game's development. Wilson shows how tactics spread around the world:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;� How the South Americans shrugged off the colonial order to add their own finesse to the game;&lt;br /&gt;� How the Europeans harnessed individual technique and built it into a team structure;&lt;br /&gt;� How the game once featured five strikers up front; now a lone striker is not uncommon;&lt;br /&gt;� How and why it was the Scots who introduced passing into the game. Why did the Scottish introduce passing into the game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in this new edition — the first for the North American market — Wilson will provide a definitive understanding of the tactical genius of Barcelona, arguably the greatest team ever, whose innovations on the field: hard pressing, the inter-movement of players, a focus on the retention of possession with close passing, and a team composed of players who grew up together, in their case through the academy at La Masia, have made it the team both to beat and emulate.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning translator of &lt;i&gt;The Iliad&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; comes a brilliant new translation of Virgil's great epic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing the ashes of Troy, Aeneas, Achilles’s mighty foe in the &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt;, begins an incredible journey to fulfill his destiny as the founder of Rome. His voyage will take him through stormy seas, entangle him in a tragic love affair, and lure him into the world of the dead itself—all the way tormented by the vengeful Juno, Queen of the Gods. Ultimately, he reaches the promised land of Italy where, after bloody battles and with high hopes, he founds what will become the Roman empire. An unsparing portrait of a man caught between love, duty, and fate, the &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt; redefines passion, nobility, and courage for our times. Robert Fagles, whose acclaimed translations of Homer’s &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; were welcomed as major publishing events, brings the &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt; to a new generation of readers, retaining all of the gravitas and humanity of the original Latin as well as its powerful blend of poetry and myth. Featuring an illuminating introduction to Virgil’s world by esteemed scholar Bernard Knox, this volume lends a vibrant new voice to one of the seminal literary achievements of the ancient world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pathbreaking history of the United States' overseas possessions and the true meaning of its empire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are familiar with maps that outline all fifty states. And we are also familiar with the idea that the United States is an "empire," exercising power around the world. But what about the actual territories--the islands, atolls, and archipelagos--this country has governed and inhabited?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;How to Hide an Empire&lt;/i&gt;, Daniel Immerwahr tells the fascinating story of the United States outside the United States. In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that cast American history in a new light. We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors collected one of the nineteenth century's most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site of the most destructive event on U.S. soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr shows how U.S. doctors conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the U.S. Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism. Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new sort of influence that did not require the control of space. Rich with absorbing vignettes, full of surprises, and driven by an original conception of what empire and globalization mean today, &lt;i&gt;How to Hide an Empire&lt;/i&gt; is a major and compulsively readable work of history.</description>

  <description>The Kill (La Curee) is the second volume in Zola's great cycle of twenty novels, Les Rougon-Macquart, and the first to establish Paris - the capital of modernity - as the centre of Zola's narrative world. Conceived as a representation of the uncontrollable 'appetites' unleashed by the Second Empire (1852-70) and the transformation of the city by Baron Haussmann, the novel combines into a single, powerful vision the twin themes of lust for money and lust for pleasure. The all-pervading promiscuity of the new Paris is reflected in the dissolute and frenetic lives of an unscrupulous property speculator, Saccard, his neurotic wife Renee, and her dandified lover, Saccard's son Maxime.&lt;br /&gt; About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>How did the modern dynamist economy of wealth and opportunity come about? This major new analytical work emphasizes the often surprising, fundamental and continuing processes of innovation and transformation which has produced the world we live in now. / Today we live in a social and economic world that is fundamentally different from the one inhabited by our ancestors. The difference between the experience of people living today and that of all of our ancestors back to the advent of agriculture is as great as that between them and their hunter-gatherer forebears. The processes of transformational changes could have started many times in history - but they first became sustained in North-West Europe about 240 years ago. The question of why this happened in that particular place and time is one that has exercised generations of scholars. Thanks to that work we now have a much clearer idea of how and why the traditional world of our ancestors was so different from the modern world that we inhabit. This book builds on that work and gives a new answer to the question of why and how things changed, showing that this unprecedented breakthrough was the result of the way a particular world-historical process worked out in Europe - largely because of contingent and accidental factors. / The book also considers the question of what kind of world it is that we now live in - and whether it can continue. / Contents: Introduction. / Chapter 1. The Way We Live Now - and the Way We Once Lived. / Ch. 2. Debates and Theories. /Ch. 3. Song China and the Ming Restoration - A Case Study./ Ch. 4. The Military Revolution and the World it Made. / Ch. 5. The European Divergence. / Ch. 6. The Scientific Revolution and the Shaping of the Modern Mind. / Ch. 7. The Enlightenment and the Advent of Modernity. / Ch. 8. The World We Live in - For Now. / Afterword: Are We Still Living in Western Civilization?</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>The explosive, highly anticipated conclusion to the epic Cartel trilogy from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when there are no borders?  When the lines you thought existed simply vanish?  How do you plant your feet to make a stand when you no longer know what side you’re on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war has come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over forty years, Art Keller has been on the front lines of America’s longest conflict: The War On Drugs. His obsession to defeat the world’s most powerful, wealthy, and lethal kingpin—the godfather of the Sinaloa Cartel, Adán Barrera—has left him bloody and scarred, cost him people he loves, even taken a piece of his soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Keller is elevated to the highest ranks of the DEA, only to find that in destroying one monster he has created thirty more that are wreaking even more chaos and suffering in his beloved Mexico. But not just there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barrera’s final legacy is the heroin epidemic scourging America. Throwing himself into the gap to stem the deadly flow, Keller finds himself surrounded by enemies—men that want to kill him, politicians that want to destroy him, and worse, the unimaginable—an incoming administration that’s in bed with the very drug traffickers that Keller is trying to bring down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art Keller is at war with not only the cartels, but with his own government. And the long fight has taught him more than he ever imagined. Now, he learns the final lesson—there are no borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a story that moves from deserts south of the border to Wall Street, from the slums of Guatemala to the marbled corridors of Washington, D.C., Winslow follows a new generation of narcos, the cops that fight them, the street traffickers, the addicts, the politicians, money-launderers, real-estate moguls and mere children fleeing the violence for the chance of a life in a new country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shattering tale of vengeance, violence, corruption and justice, this last novel in Don Winslow’s magnificent, award-winning, internationally bestselling trilogy is packed with unforgettable, drawn-from-the-headlines scenes. Shocking in its brutality, raw in its humanity, &lt;em&gt;Untitled&lt;/em&gt; is an unflinching portrait of modern America, a story of—and for—our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling second novel in the explosive Power of the Dog series--an action-filled look at the drug trade that takes you deep inside a world riddled with corruption, betrayal, and bloody revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Two of the Power of the Dog Series&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It's 2004. Ad�n Barrera, kingpin of El Federaci�n, is languishing in a California federal prison. Ex-DEA agent Art Keller passes his days in a monastery, having lost everything to his thirty-year blood feud with the drug lord. Then Barrera escapes. Now, there's a two-million-dollar bounty on Keller's head and no one else capable of taking Barrera down. As the carnage of the drug war reaches surreal new heights, the two men are locked in a savage struggle that will stretch from the mountains of Sinaloa to the shores of Veracruz, to the halls of power in Washington, ensnaring countless others in its wake. Internationally bestselling author Don Winslow's &lt;i&gt;The Cartel&lt;/i&gt; is the searing, unfiltered epic of the drug war in the twenty-first century.</description>

      <![CDATA[The second installment of Winslow's drug war trilogy. Not as strong as The Power of the Dog-it lacks the deep character development of that novel, but it's still pretty good. Especially the climatic scene, a tour de force of suspenseful action writing. Absolutely brutal reading, though that is to...]]>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cartel&lt;/i&gt; comes an explosive novel of the drug trade that takes you deep inside a world riddled with corruption, betrayal, and bloody revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prequel to &lt;i&gt;The Cartel&lt;/i&gt;, and set about 10 years earlier, &lt;i&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/i&gt; introduces a brilliant cast of characters. Art Keller is an obsessive DEA agent. The Barrera brothers are heirs to a drug empire. Nora Hayden is a jaded teenager who becomes a high-class hooker. Father Parada is a powerful and incorruptible Catholic priest. Callan is an Irish kid from Hell’s kitchen who grows up to be a merciless hit man. And they are all trapped in the world of the Mexican drug Federación. From the streets of New York City to Mexico City and Tijuana to the jungles of Central America, this is the war on drugs like you’ve never seen it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - Part love story, part workplace drama, this sharply observed novel is a witty critique of the false judgments we make in a social-media-obsessed world. &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sophie Kinsella has written her most timely novel yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere Katie Brenner looks, someone else is living the life she longs for, particularly her boss, Demeter Farlowe. Demeter is brilliant and creative, lives with her perfect family in a posh townhouse, and wears the coolest clothes. Katie's life, meanwhile, is a daily struggle--from her dismal rental to her oddball flatmates to the tense office politics she's trying to negotiate. No wonder Katie takes refuge in not-quite-true Instagram posts, especially as she's desperate to make her dad proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, just as she's finding her feet--not to mention a possible new romance--the worst happens. Demeter fires Katie. Shattered but determined to stay positive, Katie retreats to her family's farm in Somerset to help them set up a vacation business. London has never seemed so far away--until Demeter unexpectedly turns up as a guest. Secrets are spilled and relationships rejiggered, and as the stakes for Katie's future get higher, she must question her own assumptions about what makes for a truly meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Kinsella is celebrated for her vibrant, relatable characters and her great storytelling gifts. Now she returns with all of the wit, warmth, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of her bestsellers to spin this fresh, modern story about presenting the perfect life when the reality is far from the truth.</description>

  <description>From birthday cakes and anniversary dinners to summer vacations at the beach, each family has its own ways of marking the days and seasons of its life. For the Christian family--especially Episcopalians--it's no different. With an array of colors and an assortment of rich traditions, Episcopalians move through the Church year, marking the days and seasons that tell the story of Christ in our lives--in history and today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book--written for newcomers to the Episcopal Church as well as lifelong members--takes readers by the hand and leads them through the Church year, from the first Sunday of Advent through the last Sunday of Pentecost, answering questions like "Why do we use purple in Lent?" and "What does Maundy Thursday mean?" In an easy-to-read conversational style, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Church Y&lt;/em&gt;ear introduces readers to the traditions of the Church seasons and explains why we do what we do. But it does more than offer interesting trivia about church vestments and pageantry. Its insights can help readers participate in the liturgies of the Church year in a deeper, more meaningful way.</description>

  <description>In this guide for newcomers as well as lifelong Episcopalians, author Vicki Black helps readers navigate the currents of Anglican liturgy and discover its richness and beauty. As we use the Book of Common Prayer, Black says, "we discover we are not alone, and this liturgical current of worship, prayer, and praise will indeed take us where we want to go-union with the God we seek to love." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Welcome to the Book of Common Prayer shows readers everything from where to find the Sunday collect to how to pray the Daily Office. But it's more than a how-to. It offers history and background that help make the prayer book a more meaningful part of the worship life of individuals and congregations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With thoughtful reflection questions, this is a perfect volume for parish study groups.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing Detective P.T. Marsh in a swift and bruising debut where Elmore Leonard’s staccato prose meets Greg Iles’ Southern settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can you solve a crime if you’ve killed the prime suspect?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective P.T. Marsh was a rising star on the police force of Mason Falls, Georgia—until his wife and young son were killed in an accident. Since that night, caught in a spiral of grief and booze, he’s lost the ability to see the line between smart moves and disastrous decisions. Such as when he decides to ’help out’ an exotic dancer by confronting her abusive boyfriend. When the next morning he gets called to the scene of his newest murder case, he is stunned to arrive at the house of a dead man, the very man he beat up the night before. He could swear the guy was alive when he left, but can he be sure? What he does know is that his fingerprints are all over the crime scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the trouble is only beginning. P.T. and his partner Remy begin to suspect the murder is connected to a local arson and lynching; two days earlier, the dead body of a black teenager was found in a burned-out field, a portion of a blackened rope around his neck—and P.T. realizes he might have killed the #1 suspect of this horrific crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid rising racial tension and media scrutiny, P.T. uncovers something sinister at the heart of the boy’s murder—a conspiracy leading all the way back to the time of the Civil War. Risking everything to unravel the puzzle even as he fights off his own personal demons, P.T. races headlong toward an incendiary and life-altering showdown.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, a monumental new reflection on American conservatism, examining how the Founders' belief in natural rights created a great American political tradition--one that now finds itself under threat, both from progressives and elements inside the Republican Party.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more than four decades, George F. Will has attempted to discern the principles of the Western political tradition and apply them to America's civic life. Today, the stakes could hardly be higher. Vital questions about the nature of man, of rights, of equality, of majority rule are bubbling just beneath the surface of daily events in America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Founders' vision, articulated first in the Declaration of Independence and carried out in the Constitution, gave the new republic a framework for government unique in world history. Their beliefs in natural rights, limited government, religious freedom, and in human virtue and dignity ushered in two centuries of American prosperity. Now, as Will shows, America has become an administrative state, just as destructive trends have overtaken family life and higher education. Semi-autonomous executive agencies wield essentially unaccountable power. Congress has failed in its duty to exercise its legislative powers. And the executive branch has slipped the Constitution's leash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the intellectual battle between the vision of Founding Fathers like James Madison, who advanced the notion of natural rights that pre-exist government, and the progressivism first advanced by Woodrow Wilson, the Founders have been losing. It's time to reverse America's political fortunes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Expansive, intellectually thrilling, and written with the erudite wit that has made Will beloved by millions of readers, &lt;i&gt;The Conservative Sensibility&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary new book from one of America's most celebrated political writers.</description>

  <description>'He loved power for power's sake . . . He was without question the greatest of the Rougons.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Excellency Eugene Rougon&lt;/em&gt; (1876) is the sixth novel in Zola's twenty-volume Rougon-Macquart cycle. A political novel set in the corridors of power and in the upper echelons of French Second Empire society, including the Imperial court, it focuses on the fluctuating fortunes of the authoritarian Eugene Rougon, the "vice-Emperor." But it is more than just a chronicle. It plunges the reader into the essential dynamics of the political: the rivalries, the scheming, the jockeying for position, the ups and downs, the play of interests, the lobbying and gossip, the patronage and string-pulling, the bribery and blackmail, and, especially, the manipulation of language for political purposes. The novel's themes--especially its treatment of political discourse--have remarkable contemporary resonance. &lt;em&gt;His Excellency Eugene Rougon&lt;/em&gt; is about politics everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No-No Boy &lt;/i&gt;tells the gripping tale of Ichiro Yamada, a young man who, like many Japanese-Americans, refuses to denounce his Japanese heritage and fight for the US Army during the Second World War. His decisions force him to spend four long years in an internment camp and then in prison. On his release, he struggles to reconcile the beliefs that led to his imprisonment with a radically changed postwar America. This is a powerful novel that raises timely questions of identity, heritage and assimilation.</description>

  <description>Has the United States been a force for liberty around the world? Should it be? And if so, how? To answer these questions, Christopher A. Preble traces the history of U.S. foreign policy from the American Founding to the present, examining the ideas that have animated it, asking whether America's policy choices have made the world safer and freer, and considering the impact of those choices on freedom at home. Preble explains the need to question the assumptions that drive American foreign policy in the modern era--especially the assumption that American politicians can and should forcibly remake the international order to suit their desires. He asks readers to consider whether America and the world would be safer and freer if U.S. foreign policy incorporated libertarian insights about the limitations of government power. At once evenhanded and uncompromising, Peace, War, and Liberty is a comprehensive challenge to the interventionist ideology of America's foreign policy establishment.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Fortune of the Rougons&lt;/em&gt; is the first in Zola's famous Rougon-Macquart series of novels. In it we learn how the two branches of the family came about, and the origins of the hereditary weaknesses passed down the generations. Murder, treachery, and greed are the keynotes, and just as the Empire was established through violence, the "fortune" of the Rougons is paid for in blood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the fictitious Provencal town of Plassans, &lt;em&gt;The Fortune of the Rougons&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Silvere and Miette, two idealistic young supporters of the republican resistance to Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup d'etat of December 1851. They join the woodcutters and peasants of the Var to seize control of Plassans, and are opposed by the Bonapartist loyalists led by Silvere's uncle, Pierre Rougon. Meanwhile, the foundations of the Rougon family and its illegitimate Macquart branch are being laid in the brutal beginnings of the Imperial regime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian Nelson provides an engaging translation as well as a wide-ranging introduction that explains the background to the Rougon-Macquart series as well as the historical setting of the novel and its special qualities. This edition also features a chronology, bibliography, and extensive explanatory notes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Series&lt;/strong&gt; For over 100 years &lt;strong&gt;Oxford World's Classics&lt;/strong&gt; has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>In the first novel in Marlon James's Dark Star trilogy, myth, fantasy, and history come together to explore what happens when a mercenary is hired to find a missing child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: "He has a nose," people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written an adventure that's also an ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf explores the fundamentals of truths, the limits of power, the excesses of ambition, and our need to understand them all.</description>

      <![CDATA[A high fantasy action adventure tale infused with African lore and literary pretensions. This is an absolute slog of a book to read, saved neither by artful language nor engaging storytelling.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of the Liberation Trilogy comes the extraordinary first volume of his new trilogy about the American Revolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Rick Atkinson, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;An Army at Dawn&lt;/i&gt; and two other superb books about World War II, has long been admired for his deeply researched, stunningly vivid narrative histories. Now he turns his attention to a new war, and in the initial volume of the Revolution Trilogy he recounts the first twenty-one months of America’s violent war for independence. From the battles at Lexington and Concord in spring 1775 to those at Trenton and Princeton in winter 1777, American militiamen and then the ragged Continental Army take on the world’s most formidable fighting force. It is a gripping saga alive with astonishing characters: Henry Knox, the former bookseller with an uncanny understanding of artillery; Nathanael Greene, the blue-eyed bumpkin who becomes a brilliant battle captain; Benjamin Franklin, the self-made man who proves to be the wiliest of diplomats; George Washington, the commander in chief who learns the difficult art of leadership when the war seems all but lost. The story is also told from the British perspective, making the mortal conflict between the redcoats and the rebels all the more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of riveting details and untold stories, &lt;i&gt;The British Are Coming&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of heroes and knaves, of sacrifice and blunder, of redemption and profound suffering. Rick Atkinson has given stirring new life to the first act of our country’s creation drama.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A celebration of individuality, diversity, and nonconformity, &lt;i&gt;On Liberty&lt;/i&gt; still makes a persuasive argument for what John Stuart Mill believed to be humankind’s essential liberties: the freedoms of speech, assembly, and the pursuit of pleasure, so long as one’s actions do not impede the liberty of another. These freedoms, he maintained, result in a far more successful society than one ruled by the tyranny of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exploration of the limits of government over the individual, this treatise on personal liberty has inspired debate since its publication in 1859, and has provided the foundation for modern liberal political thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Revised edition: Previously published as &lt;i&gt;On Liberty&lt;/i&gt;, this edition of &lt;i&gt;On Liberty (AmazonClassics Edition)&lt;/i&gt; includes editorial revisions.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Delve into &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people&lt;/b&gt;. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear &lt;b&gt;a scarlet "A" on her clothing&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, &lt;b&gt;arrives at the exact moment&lt;/b&gt; of her deepest public shaming and vows to get &lt;b&gt;revenge&lt;/b&gt;. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Though originally published in 1850, the story is &lt;b&gt;set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts&lt;/b&gt; among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, he created a story that &lt;b&gt;highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths&lt;/b&gt;. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complete and unabridged&lt;/b&gt;, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.</description>

  <description>In Depression-era New York, Mr Nut is an oblivious American everyman, who wants to strike it rich. Over the course of a single night he meets a cast of strange characters - disgruntled workers at a Communist cafeteria, lecherous old men, sexually exploited women and pesky authors - all of whom eventually convince him to cast off his bourgeois aspirations to become a radical activist. Absurdist, inventive and suffused with revolutionary fervour, &lt;i&gt;The Hanging on Union Square&lt;/i&gt; is a work of blazing wit and originality.</description>

  <description>The thirteenth novel in Émile Zola’s great Rougon-Macquart sequence, Germinal expresses outrage at the exploitation of the many by the few, but also shows humanity’s capacity for compassion and hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etienne Lantier, an unemployed railway worker, is a clever but uneducated young man with a dangerous temper. Forced to take a back-breaking job at Le Voreux mine when he cannot get other work, he discovers that his fellow miners are ill, hungry, in debt, and unable to feed and clothe their families. When conditions in the mining community deteriorate even further, Lantier finds himself leading a strike that could mean starvation or salvation for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•New translation&lt;br /&gt;• Includes introduction, suggestions for further reading, filmography, chronology, explanatory notes, and glossary</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A brilliant and brave investigation by Michael Pollan, author of five &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; best sellers, into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs--and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into the experience of various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the Sixties, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, &lt;i&gt;How to Change Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's "mental travelogue" is not just psychedelic drugs, but the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both struggle and beauty, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.</description>

  <description>A national bestseller for almost an entire year, &lt;i&gt;The Days of Abandonment&lt;/i&gt; shocked and captivated its Italian public when first published. It is the gripping story of a woman's descent into devastating emptiness after being abandoned by her husband with two young children to care for. When she finds herself literally trapped within the four walls of their high-rise apartment, she is forced to confront her ghosts, the potential loss of her own identity, and the possibility that life may never return to normal.</description>

  <description>Pessimism claims an impressive following--from Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, to Freud, Camus, and Foucault. Yet "pessimist" remains a term of abuse--an accusation of a bad attitude--or the diagnosis of an unhappy psychological state. Pessimism is thought of as an exclusively negative stance that inevitably leads to resignation or despair. Even when pessimism looks like utter truth, we are told that it makes the worst of a bad situation. Bad for the individual, worse for the species--who would actually counsel pessimism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Joshua Foa Dienstag does. In &lt;i&gt;Pessimism&lt;/i&gt;, he challenges the received wisdom about pessimism, arguing that there is an unrecognized yet coherent and vibrant pessimistic philosophical tradition. More than that, he argues that pessimistic thought may provide a critically needed alternative to the increasingly untenable progressivist ideas that have dominated thinking about politics throughout the modern period. Laying out powerful grounds for pessimism's claim that progress is not an enduring feature of human history, Dienstag argues that political theory must begin from this predicament. He persuasively shows that pessimism has been--and can again be--an energizing and even liberating philosophy, an ethic of radical possibility and not just a criticism of faith. The goal--of both the pessimistic spirit and of this fascinating account of pessimism--is not to depress us, but to edify us about our condition and to fortify us for life in a disordered and disenchanted universe.</description>

  <description>Meet Rebecca Bloomwood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s a journalist. She spends her working life telling others how to manage their money.&lt;br /&gt; She spends her leisure time … shopping.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Retail therapy is the answer to all her problems. She knows she should stop, but she can’t. She tries Cutting Back, she tries Making More Money. But neither seems to work. The stories she concocts become more and more fantastic as she tries to untangle her increasingly dire financial difficulties. Her only comfort is to buy herself something – just a little something…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Becky ever escape from this dream world, find true love, and regain the use of her Switch card?</description>

      <![CDATA[Not a bad novel. The Finnish banking interview scene is a flight of comic genius but most of the rest is rather flat. It's also not my typical reading genre so I'm not the best person to ask about it. Maybe as I read more in the genre I'll come to appreciate it more. ]]>

  <description>They are an unlikely pair: George is “small and quick and dark of face”; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a “family,” clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laborers in California’s dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman, nor predict the consequences of Lennie’s unswerving obedience to the things George taught him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21417799-a-confederacy-of-dunces" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, &lt;i&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/i&gt;. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through &lt;i&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/i&gt; are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How the father and son presidents foresaw the rise of the cult of personality and fought those who sought to abuse the weaknesses inherent in our democracy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, no one has properly dissected the intertwined lives of the second and sixth (father and son) presidents. John and John Quincy Adams were brilliant, prickly politicians and arguably the most independently minded among leaders of the founding generation. Distrustful of blind allegiance to a political party, they brought a healthy skepticism of a brand-new system of government to the country's first 50 years. They were unpopular for their fears of the potential for demagoguery lurking in democracy, and--in a twist that predicted the turn of twenty-first century politics--they warned against, but were unable to stop, the seductive appeal of political celebrities Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a bold recasting of the Adamses' historical roles, &lt;i&gt;The Problem of Democracy&lt;/i&gt; is a major critique of the ways in which their prophetic warnings have been systematically ignored over the centuries. It's also an intimate family drama that brings out the torment and personal hurt caused by the gritty conduct of early American politics. Burstein and Isenberg make sense of the presidents' somewhat iconoclastic, highly creative engagement with America's political and social realities. By taking the temperature of American democracy, from its heated origins through multiple upheavals, the authors reveal the dangers and weaknesses that have been present since the beginning. They provide a clear-eyed look at a decoy democracy that masks the reality of elite rule while remaining open, since the days of George Washington, to a very undemocratic result in the formation of a cult surrounding the person of an elected leader.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An against-the-grain polemic on American capitalism from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tyler Cowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;We love to hate the 800-pound gorilla. Walmart and Amazon destroy communities and small businesses. Facebook turns us into addicts while putting our personal data at risk. From skeptical politicians like Bernie Sanders who, at a 2016 presidential campaign rally said, "If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist," to millennials, only 42 percent of whom support capitalism, belief in big business is at an all-time low. But are big companies inherently evil? If business is so bad, why does it remain so integral to the basic functioning of America? Economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen says our biggest problem is that we don't love business enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Big Business&lt;/i&gt;, Cowen puts forth an impassioned defense of corporations and their essential role in a balanced, productive, and progressive society. He dismantles common misconceptions and untangles conflicting intuitions. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, only 12 percent of Americans trust big business "quite a lot," and only 6 percent trust it "a great deal." Yet Americans as a group are remarkably willing to trust businesses, whether in the form of buying a new phone on the day of its release or simply showing up to work in the expectation they will be paid. Cowen illuminates the crucial role businesses play in spurring innovation, rewarding talent and hard work, and creating the bounty on which we've all come to depend.</description>

  <description>Many Americans believe that foreign military intervention is central to protecting our domestic freedoms. But Christopher J. Coyne and Abigail R. Hall urge engaged citizens to think again. Overseas, our government takes actions in the name of defense that would not be permissible within national borders. Emboldened by the relative weakness of governance abroad, the U.S. government is able to experiment with a broader range of social controls. Under certain conditions, these policies, tactics, and technologies are then re-imported to America, changing the national landscape and increasing the extent to which we live in a police state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher J. Coyne and Abigail R. Hall examine this pattern--which they dub "the boomerang effect"--considering a variety of rich cases that include the rise of state surveillance, the militarization of domestic law enforcement, the expanding use of drones, and torture in U.S. prisons. Synthesizing research and applying an economic lens, they develop a generalizable theory to predict and explain a startling trend. &lt;i&gt;Tyranny Comes Home&lt;/i&gt; unveils a new aspect of the symbiotic relationship between foreign interventions and domestic politics. It gives us alarming insight into incidents like the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri and the Snowden case--which tell a common story about contemporary foreign policy and its impact on our civil liberties.</description>

  <description>Francis Ford Coppola's &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt; (1972) marked a transition in American filmmaking, and its success - as a work of art, as a creative property exploited by its studio, Paramount Pictures, as a model for aspiring filmmakers - changed Hollywood forever.  Jon Lewis's study of the film looks at the significance of &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt; in Hollywood's dramatic box-office turnaround in the 1970s and offers a critical and historical discussion of &lt;i&gt;The Godfather's&lt;/i&gt; place within the crime and gangster film genre.  Lewis focuses on the film as a commercial as well as an artistic landmark of American auteur cinema, as a singularly important film in Hollywood studio history and as a brilliant reworked modern genre picture that at once adopts and adapts the gangster film.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</description>

  <description>In this book, Dana Polan sets out to unlock the style and technique of &lt;i&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/i&gt;. He shows how broad Tarantino's points of reference are, and analyzes the narrative accomplishment and complexity. In addition, Polan argues that macho attitudes celebrated in film are much more complex than they seem.</description>

  <description>Since its initial release, Raging Bull has been called the greatest film of the 1980s, the greatest boxing film ever made, the greatest sports film ever made, and, indeed, one of the greatest films of all time. The introduction to this study tells the story of how the film came about, examining its inspirations and positioning the film within the history of cinema. Subsequent chapters, each written by contributors from different disciplines, critique the film from a variety of perspectives.</description>

  <description>From the two-time NBCC Finalist, an emotionally resonant, fiercely imaginative new novel about a family whose road trip across America collides with an immigration crisis at the southwestern border--an indelible journey told with breathtaking imagery, spare lyricism, and profound humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother and father set out with their two children, a boy and a girl, driving from New York to Arizona in the heat of summer. Their destination: Apacheria, the place the Apaches once called home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Apaches? asks the ten-year-old son. Because they were the last of something, answers his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their car, they play games and sing along to music. But on the radio, there is news about an "immigration crisis": thousands of kids trying to cross the southwestern border into the United States, but getting detained--or lost in the desert along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the family drives--through Virginia to Tennessee, across Oklahoma and Texas--we sense they are on the brink of a crisis of their own. A fissure is growing between the parents, one the children can almost feel beneath their feet. They are led, inexorably, to a grand, harrowing adventure--both in the desert landscape and within the chambers of their own imaginations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through several compelling voices, blending texts, sounds, and images, Lost Children Archive is an astonishing feat of literary virtuosity. It is a richly engaging story of how we document our experiences, and how we remember the things that matter to us the most. With urgency and empathy, it takes us deep into the lives of one remarkable family as it probes the nature of justice and equality today.</description>

  <description>This small volume—containing the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd of Bahá’u’lláh, the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh by Shoghi Effendi—has been put together for the purpose of aiding those who wish to deepen their understanding of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh. It is hoped that those participating in the study of Book 8 of the Ruhi Institute sequence, The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, may find this book to be a helpful resource.</description>

With numerous student and professional examples, this engaging and practical guide progresses from taking notes and writing first drafts to creating polished essays and comprehensive research projects.

  <description>The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky’s crowning achievement, is a tale of patricide and family rivalry that embodies the moral and spiritual dissolution of an entire society (Russia in the 1870s). It created a national furor comparable only to the excitement stirred by the publication, in 1866, of Crime and Punishment. To Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov captured the quintessence of Russian character in all its exaltation, compassion, and profligacy. Significantly, the book was on Tolstoy’s bedside table when he died. Readers in every language have since accepted Dostoevsky’s own evaluation of this work and have gone further by proclaiming it one of the few great novels of all ages and countries.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Promulgation of Universal Peace&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of 140 talks given by 'Abdu'l-Baha-- the son and appointed successor of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet and Founder of the Baha'i Faith-- during his extensive tour of North America in 1912. This compliation touches on a wide range of subjects including the coming of age of the human race, the oneness and continuity of the Prophets of God, and the oneness of religion as a social force for establishing world order and peace. These talks serve as a priceless resource for studying the language and personal example of one of the most significant religious figures in recent history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if your sense of duty required you to betray the man you love? One woman struggles to choose between her honor and her heart in this enthralling espionage drama set against an unforgettable historical backdrop.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1986, the heart of the Cold War, and Marie Mitchell is an intelligence officer with the FBI. She's brilliant but she's also a young black woman working in an old boys' club, and her career has stalled out; she's overlooked for every high profile squad, and her days are filled with monotonous paperwork. So when she's given the opportunity to join a shadowy task force aimed at undermining Thomas Sankara, the charismatic, revolutionary president of Burkina Faso, whose Communist ideology has made him a target for American intervention, she says yes. Yes, even though she secretly admires the work Thomas is doing for his country. Yes, even though she is still grieving the mysterious death of her sister, whose example led Marie to this career path in the first place. Yes, even though a furious part of her suspects she's being offered the job because of her appearance and not her talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year that follows, Marie will observe Thomas, seduce him, and ultimately, have a hand in the coup that will bring him down. But doing so will change everything she believes about what it means to be a spy, a lover, a sister, and a good American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by true events--Thomas Sankara is known as "Africa's Che Guevara"--this novel knits together a gripping spy thriller, a heartbreaking family drama, and a passionate romance. This is a face of the Cold War you've never seen before, and it introduces a powerful new literary voice.</description>

  <description>From the novelist dubbed "the Korean Henning Mankell" (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;) comes a fantastical crime novel set in an alternate Seoul where assassination guilds compete for market dominance. Perfect for fans of Han Kang and Patrick deWitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind every assassination, there is an anonymous mastermind--a plotter--working in the shadows. Plotters quietly dictate the moves of the city's most dangerous criminals, but their existence is little more than legend. Just who are the plotters? And more important, what do they want?&lt;br /&gt; Reseng is an assassin. Raised by a cantankerous killer named Old Raccoon in the crime headquarters "The Library," Reseng never questioned anything: where to go, who to kill, or why his home was filled with books that no one ever read. But one day, Reseng steps out of line on a job, toppling a set of carefully calibrated plans. And when he uncovers an extraordinary scheme set into motion by an eccentric trio of young women--a convenience store clerk, her wheelchair-bound sister, and a cross-eyed librarian--Reseng will have to decide if he will remain a pawn or finally take control of the plot. &lt;br /&gt; Crackling with action and filled with unforgettable characters, &lt;i&gt;The Plotters&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply entertaining thriller that soars with the soul, wit, and lyricism of real literary craft.</description>

  <description>Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It’s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret. And everyone is watching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the headmaster credited with turning around the local school, Tom Fitzwilliam is beloved by one and all—including Joey Mullen, his new neighbor, who quickly develops an intense infatuation with this thoroughly charming yet unavailable man. Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom’s teenaged son Freddie—a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5—excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Tom’s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she’s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems. For one thing, he has taken a particular liking to her best friend and fellow classmate, and Jenna’s mother—whose mental health has admittedly been deteriorating in recent years—is convinced that Mr. Fitzwilliam is stalking her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, twenty years earlier, a schoolgirl writes in her diary, charting her doomed obsession with a handsome young English teacher named Mr. Fitzwilliam…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A master class in strategic thinking, distilled from the legendary program the author has co-taught at Yale for decades&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over 20 years, a select group of Yale undergraduates has been admitted into the year-long "Grand Strategy" seminar team-taught by John Lewis Gaddis and Paul Kennedy. Its purpose: to provide a grounding in strategic decision-making in the face of crisis to prepare future American leaders for important work. Now, John Lewis Gaddis has transposed the experience of that course into a wonderfully succinct, lucid and inspirational book, a view from the commanding heights of statesmanship across the landscape of world history from the ancient Greeks to Lincoln, and beyond. A thrilling experience for history lovers and a necessary one for anyone serious about the art of leadership, On Grand Strategy is the very definition of a master class.</description>

  <description>An NYRB Classics Original&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterpiece of Gulag literature, the complete &lt;i&gt;Kolyma Stories&lt;/i&gt; is a thousand-page epic composed of short fictional tales based on Russian writer Varlam Shalamov’s fifteen years in the Gulag. He spent six years as a slave in the gold mines of Kolyma, a far northeast region of the USSR and one of the coldest and most inhospitable places on Earth, before finding a less intolerable life as a paramedic in the prison camps. He began writing his six-volume prose account of life in Kolyma after Stalin’s death in 1953 and continued until his own physical and mental decline in the late 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kolyma Stories&lt;/i&gt; comprises the first three volumes of Shalamov’s tales. The line between autobiography and fiction is indistinct: Everything in these stories was experienced or witnessed by Shalamov. His work records the real names of prisoners and their oppressors; he himself appears simply as “I” or “Shalamov,” or at times under a pseudonym, such as Andreyev or Krist. These collected stories form the biography of a rare survivor, a historical record of the Gulag, and, because the stories have more than documentary value, a literary work of creative power and conviction.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Republic in Peril&lt;/em&gt;, David C. Hendrickson advances a powerful critique of American policy since the end of the Cold War. America's outsized military spending and global commitments, he shows, undermine rather than uphold international order. They raise rather than reduce the danger of war, imperiling both American security and domestic liberty. An alternative path lies in a new internationalism in tune with the United Nations Charter and the philosophy of republican liberty embraced by America's founders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sum of the conventional view-touted by the national security establishment and embraced by Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush-is that it is impossible to have a liberal world order unless America has hostile relations with Russia, China, and Iran, together with a shifting cast of lesser states. Donald Trump, iconoclastic is so many ways, promises to bring the militarization of U.S. foreign policy to an entirely new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is precisely those who would lead us into battle with "hostile states" who threaten a liberal world order, because they look to a competition that is to be settled through dominance rather than reciprocity. Formed by ideology, greatly fortified by special interests, the U.S. posture has put it into standing collision with other great powers. The flaws of the U.S.-led world order-a chronic overreliance on force, habitual violations of the rules governing intervention-should not be attributed to liberalism but to a flock of "neo-isms" parading in its name. In searching for a remedy, we must find it by rediscovering, not repudiating, the liberal tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hendrickson offers a panoramic view of America's choices in foreign policy, analyzing the vested interests and ideologies that have justified a sprawling global empire over the last 25 years. Hendrickson recovers the tradition of liberal pluralism, one that sees in nonintervention, the balance of power, and great power concert the formula for a durable peace. Rather than claiming a superior role as judge, jury, and executioner, the United States must share power in accordance with the Golden Rule. It needs restraint rather than braggadocio, acceptance of its role as a nation among the nations rather than arrogant pretensions regarding its exceptional virtue and superior wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranging widely, from the classics of American political thought and international theory to the bewildering thicket of hot wars and regional feuds across the globe that embroil America, Hendrickson forcefully shows that the militarization of U.S. foreign policy is deeply at odds with the animating purposes and principles of the American experiment.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Since its release in 1949, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced millions of readers by combining the insights of modern psychology with Joseph Campbell’s revolutionary understanding of comparative mythology. In these pages, Campbell outlines the Hero’s Journey, a universal motif of adventure and transformation that runs through virtually all of the world’s mythic traditions. He also explores the Cosmogonic Cycle, the mythic pattern of world creation and destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of the Joseph Campbell Foundation’s Collected Works of Joseph Campbell, this third edition features expanded illustrations, a comprehensive bibliography, and more accessible sidebars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As relevant today as when it was first published, The Hero with a Thousand Faces continues to find new audiences in fields ranging from religion and anthropology to literature and film studies. The book has also profoundly influenced creative artists—including authors, songwriters, game designers, and filmmakers—and continues to inspire all those interested in the inherent human need to tell stories.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An expert diagnosis of U.S. foreign policy—why it keeps disappointing us, and what we can do to fix it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1992, the United States stood at the pinnacle of world power and Americans were confident that a new era of peace and prosperity was at hand. Twenty-five years later, those hopes have been dashed. Relations with Russia and China have deteriorated, the European Union is wobbling, and violent extremism is spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for these recurring failures, Stephen M. Walt argues in &lt;i&gt;The Hell of Good Intentions&lt;/i&gt;, is the combination of America’s still-unmatched power and the foreign policy establishment’s stubborn consensus around a strategy of “liberal hegemony.” Because the United States is so powerful and secure, it can pursue ambitious foreign policy goals even when they are unnecessary and doomed to fail. Walt exposes the inner workings of the foreign policy elite across the Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations and shows how they have been able to avoid accountability, keep discredited ideas and policies in vogue, and maintain influence despite past blunders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confronting the failures of three different presidents, Walt makes the case for a fresh approach. As the next president grapples with the consequences of America’s recent misadventures, &lt;i&gt;The Hell of Good Intentions&lt;/i&gt; offers both a compelling diagnosis of our current malaise and a prescription for enduring success.</description>

  <description>When Palmer Stoat notices the black pickup truck following him on the highway, he fears his precious Range Rover is about to be carjacked. But Twilly Spree, the man tailing Stoat, has vengeance, not sport-utility vehicles, on his mind. Idealistic, independently wealthy and pathologically short-tempered, Twilly has dedicated himself to saving Florida's wilderness from runaway destruction. He favors unambiguous political statements -- such as torching Jet-Skis or blowing up banks -- that leave his human targets shaken but re-educated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching Stoat blithely dump a trail of fast-food litter out the window, Twilly decides to teach him a lesson. Thus, Stoat's prized Range Rover becomes home to a horde of hungry dung beetles. Which could have been the end to it had Twilly not discovered that Stoat is one of Florida's cockiest and most powerful political fixers, whose latest project is the "malling" of a pristine Gulf Coast island. Now the real Hiaasen-variety fun begins . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dognapping eco-terrorists, bogus big-time hunters, a Republicans-only hooker, an infamous ex-governor who's gone back to nature, thousands of singing toads and a Labrador retriever greater than the sum of his Labrador parts -- these are only some of the denizens of Carl Hiaasen's outrageously funny new novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly twisted entertainment wrapped around a powerful ecological plea, &lt;b&gt;Sick Puppy&lt;/b&gt; gleefully lives up to its title and gives us Hiaasen at his riotous and muckraking best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;God: A Biography&lt;/i&gt;, an erudite, hugely informative portrait of the God of Islam, the world's second largest, fastest-growing, and perhaps most tragically misunderstood religion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Allah? What makes Him unique? And what does He ask of those who submit to His teachings? In the spirit of his Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;God&lt;/i&gt;, a trailblazing "biography" of the protagonist of the Old Testament, and &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt;, his brilliant portrait of biblical Jesus, acclaimed religious scholar Jack Miles undertakes to answer these questions with his characteristic perspicacity, intelligence, and command of the subject. Miles depicts a "character" less mercurial than Yahweh, less ready to forgive than Christ, and yet emphatically part of their traditions. &lt;i&gt;God in the Qur'an&lt;/i&gt; revises and perfects: His purpose is to make whole what had been corrupted or lost from the practices and scriptures of the earlier Abrahamic religions. Setting passages from the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Qur'an side by side, Miles illuminates what is unique about Allah, His teachings and His temperament, and in doing so revises that which is false, distorted, or simply absent from our conception of the heart of Islam. Miles writes, "I hope [that by reading this book] you may find it a little easier to trust the Muslim next door, thinking of him as someone whose religion, after all, may not be so wildly unreasonable that someone holding to it could not be a trusted friend."</description>

  <description>A humiliating military defeat by Bismarck's Germany, a brutal siege, and a bloody uprising Paris in 1871 was a shambles, and the question loomed, "Could this extraordinary city even survive?" Mary McAuliffe takes the reader back to these perilous years following the abrupt collapse of the Second Empire and France's uncertain venture into the Third Republic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1900, Paris had recovered and the Belle Epoque was in full flower, but the decades between were difficult, marked by struggles between republicans and monarchists, the Republic and the Church, and an ongoing economic malaise, darkened by a rising tide of virulent anti-Semitism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet these same years also witnessed an extraordinary blossoming, in art, literature, poetry, and music, with the Parisian cultural scene dramatically upended by revolutionaries such as Monet, Zola, Rodin, and Debussy, even while Gustave Eiffel was challenging architectural tradition with his iconic tower. Through the eyes of these pioneers and others, including Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Clemenceau, Marie Curie, and Cesar Ritz, we witness their struggles with the forces of tradition during the final years of a century hurtling towards its close. Through rich illustrations and evocative narrative, McAuliffe brings this vibrant and seminal era to life."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A major theoretical statement by a distinguished political scholar explains why a policy of liberal hegemony is doomed to fail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is widely believed in the West that the United States should spread liberal democracy across the world, foster an open international economy, and build international institutions. The policy of remaking the world in America’s image is supposed to protect human rights, promote peace, and make the world safe for democracy. But this is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has become a highly militarized state fighting wars that undermine peace, harm human rights, and threaten liberal values at home.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this major statement, the renowned international-relations scholar John Mearsheimer argues that liberal hegemony—the foreign policy pursued by the United States since the Cold War ended—is doomed to fail. It makes far more sense, he maintains, for Washington to adopt a more restrained foreign policy based on a sound understanding of how nationalism and realism constrain great powers abroad. &lt;em&gt;The Great Delusion&lt;/em&gt; is a lucid and compelling work of the first importance for scholars, policymakers, and everyone interested in the future of American foreign policy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brilliant and visionary argument for America's role as an enforcer of peace and order throughout the world--and what is likely to happen if we withdraw and focus our attention inward.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent years have brought deeply disturbing developments around the globe. American sentiment seems to be leaning increasingly toward withdrawal in the face of such disarray. In this powerful, urgent essay, Robert Kagan elucidates the reasons why American withdrawal would be the worst possible response, based as it is on a fundamental and dangerous misreading of the world. Like a jungle that keeps growing back after being cut down, the world has always been full of dangerous actors who, left unchecked, possess the desire and ability to make things worse. Kagan makes clear how the "realist" impulse to recognize our limitations and focus on our failures misunderstands the essential role America has played for decades in keeping the world's worst instability in check. A true realism, he argues, is based on the understanding that the historical norm has always been toward chaos--that the jungle will grow back, if we let it.</description>

  <description>Reading great literature well has the power to cultivate virtue. Great literature increases knowledge of and desire for the good life by showing readers what virtue looks like and where vice leads. It is not just &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; one reads but &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; one reads that cultivates virtue. Reading good literature well requires one to practice numerous virtues, such as patience, diligence, and prudence. And learning to judge wisely a character in a book, in turn, forms the reader's own character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Karen Swallow Prior takes readers on a guided tour through works of great literature both ancient and modern, exploring twelve virtues that philosophers and theologians throughout history have identified as most essential for good character and the good life. In reintroducing ancient virtues that are as relevant and essential today as ever, Prior draws on the best classical and Christian thinkers, including Aristotle, Aquinas, and Augustine. Covering authors from Henry Fielding to Cormac McCarthy, Jane Austen to George Saunders, and Flannery O'Connor to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Prior explores some of the most compelling universal themes found in the pages of classic books, helping readers learn to love life, literature, and God through their encounters with great writing. In examining works by these authors and more, Prior shows why virtues such as prudence, temperance, humility, and patience are still necessary for human flourishing and civil society. The book includes end-of-chapter reflection questions geared toward book club discussions, features original artwork throughout, and includes a foreword from Leland Ryken.</description>

  <description>Major &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award in 2012&lt;br /&gt;Selected by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; as one of the best books of 2011&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/i&gt; Best Books of the Year 2011 Title&lt;br /&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;'s 2011 Books of the Year &lt;br /&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Nonfiction Books of the Year 2011&lt;br /&gt;2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the international bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. &lt;br /&gt;Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking&lt;i&gt;, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt; is destined to be a classic.</description>

  <description>As a young man Frederick Douglass (1818–1895) escaped from slavery in Baltimore, Maryland. He was fortunate to have been taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on to become one of the major literary figures of his time. His very existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great intelligence he bore witness to the brutality of slavery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke widely, using his own story to condemn slavery. By the Civil War, Douglass had become the most famed and widely travelled orator in the nation. In his unique and eloquent voice, written and spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the United States as well as a radical patriot. After the war he sometimes argued politically with younger African Americans, but he never forsook either the Republican party or the cause of black civil and political rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this biography, David Blight has drawn on new information held in a private collection that few other historian have consulted, as well as recently discovered issues of Douglass’s newspapers.</description>

  <description>When her former governess finds happiness as the bride of a local widower, the brilliant and beautiful Emma Woodhouse — one of Jane Austen's immortal creations — flatters herself that she alone has secured the marriage and that she possesses a special talent for bringing lovers together. The young heiress next busies herself with finding a suitable husband for her friend and protégé, Harriet Smith, setting off an entertaining sequence of comic mishaps and misunderstanding in this sparkling comedy of English-village romance. Beneath its considerable wit, the novel is also the story of a young woman's progress toward self-understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emma&lt;/i&gt; abounds in the droll character sketches at which Jane Austen excelled. In addition to the well-intentional heroine and her hypochondriacal father, the village of Highbury during the Regency period is populated by an amusing circle of friends and family — kindhearted but tedious Miss Bates, a chatterbox spinster; ambitious Mr. Elton, a social-climbing parson; Frank Churchill, an enigmatic Romeo; Mr. Knightley, Emma's brother-in-law and the voice of her better nature; and a cluster of other finely drawn, unforgettable personalities.&lt;br /&gt;The author's skill at depicting the follies of human nature in a manner both realistic and affectionate elevates this tale of provincial matchmaking to the heights of scintillating satire. A classic of English literature that has delighted readers since its 1816 publication, the novel is now available in this high-quality, inexpensive edition sure to charm a new generation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A highly readable, fascinating book that jerks the debate on religion versus atheism right out of its crusted rut into the light of serious intellectual scrutiny' &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A meditation on the importance of atheism in the modern world - and its inadequacies and contradictions - by one of Britain's leading philosophers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'When you explore older atheisms, you will find some of your firmest convictions - secular or religious - are highly questionable. If this prospect disturbs you, what you are looking for may be freedom &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; thought.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a generation now, public debate has been corroded by a narrow derision of religion in the name of an often very vaguely understood 'science'. John Gray's stimulating and extremely enjoyable new book describes the rich, complex world of the atheist tradition, a tradition which he sees as in many ways as rich as that of religion itself, as well as being deeply intertwined with what is so often crudely viewed as its 'opposite'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is a book that sheds an extraordinary and varied light on what it is to be human and on the thinkers who have, at different times and places, battled to understand this issue.</description>

  <description>Growth is good. Through history, economic growth, in particular, has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, and lengthened human lives. Wealthier societies are more stable, offer better living standards, produce better medicines, and ensure greater autonomy, greater fulfillment, and more sources of fun. If we want to continue on our trends of growth, and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with it, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us and in the world at large and most of all our descendants in the future. So, how do we proceed? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tyler Cowen, in a culmination of 20 years of thinking and research, provides a roadmap for moving forward. In this new book, Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals, Cowen argues that our reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society. Stubborn Attachments, at its heart, makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a great dose of inspiration and optimism about our future possibilities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a means of practicing the altruism that Stubborn Attachments argues for, Tyler Cowen is donating all earnings from this book to a man he met in Ethiopia earlier this year with aspirations to open his own travel business.</description>

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS. AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three terrible things happen in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essun, masquerading as an ordinary schoolteacher in a quiet small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Mighty Sanze, the empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years, collapses as its greatest city is destroyed by a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heartland of the world's sole continent, a great red rift has been been torn which spews ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the Stillness, a land long familiar with struggle, and where orogenes -- those who wield the power of the earth as a weapon -- are feared far more than the long cold night. Essun has remembered herself, and she will have her daughter back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does not care if the world falls apart around her. Essun will break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.</description>

  <description>A collection of poignant, perceptive essays that expertly blends the personal and political in an exploration of American culture through the lens of our obsession with dead women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her debut collection, Alice Bolin turns a critical eye to literature and pop culture, the way media consumption reflects American society, and her own place within it. From essays on Joan Didion and James Baldwin to &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, Britney Spears, and &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, Bolin illuminates our widespread obsession with women who are abused, killed, and disenfranchised, and whose bodies (dead and alive) are used as props to bolster a man’s story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From chronicling life in Los Angeles to dissecting the “Dead Girl Show” to analyzing literary witches and werewolves, this collection challenges the narratives we create and tell ourselves, delving into the hazards of toxic masculinity and those of white womanhood. Beginning with the problem of dead women in fiction, it expands to the larger problems of living women—both the persistent injustices they suffer and the oppression that white women help perpetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, incisive, and revelatory, &lt;em&gt;Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt; is a much-needed dialogue on women’s role in the media and in our culture.</description>

  <description>With authoritative reporting honed through eight presidencies from Nixon to Obama, author Bob Woodward reveals in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside President Donald Trump’s White House and precisely how he makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies. Woodward draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand sources, meeting notes, personal diaries, files and documents. The focus is on the explosive debates and the decision-making in the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One and the White House residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; is the most intimate portrait of a sitting president ever published during the president’s first years in office.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A little magic can take you a long way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After James Henry Trotter's parents are tragically eaten by a rhinoceros, he goes to live with his two horrible aunts, Spiker and Sponge. Life there is no fun, until James accidentally drops some magic crystals by the old peach tree and strange things start to happen. The peach at the top of the tree begins to grow, and before long it's as big as a house. Inside, James meets a bunch of oversized friends—Grasshopper, Centipede, Ladybug, and more. With a snip of the stem, the peach starts rolling away, and the great adventure begins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collectable hardcover edition will feature a beautiful cover and deluxe packaging.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;A dramatic rethinking of the encounter between Montezuma and Hernando Cortés that completely overturns what we know about the Spanish conquest of the Americas&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 8, 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortés first met Montezuma, the Aztec emperor, at the entrance to the capital city of Tenochtitlan. This introduction—the prelude to the Spanish seizure of Mexico City and to European colonization of the mainland of the Americas—has long been the symbol of Cortés’s bold and brilliant military genius. Montezuma, on the other hand, is remembered as a coward who gave away a vast empire and touched off a wave of colonial invasions across the hemisphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is this really what happened? In a departure from traditional tellings, &lt;em&gt;When Montezuma Met Cortés&lt;/em&gt; uses “the Meeting”—as Restall dubs their first encounter—as the entry point into a comprehensive reevaluation of both Cortés and Montezuma. Drawing on rare primary sources and overlooked accounts by conquistadors and Aztecs alike, Restall explores Cortés’s and Montezuma’s posthumous reputations, their achievements and failures, and the worlds in which they lived—leading, step by step, to a dramatic inversion of the old story. As Restall takes us through this sweeping, revisionist account of a pivotal moment in modern civilization, he calls into question our view of the history of the Americas, and, indeed, of history itself. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;'s "10 Best Books of 2015"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An NYRB Classics Original &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Door&lt;/i&gt; is an unsettling exploration of the relationship between two very different women. Magda is a writer, educated, married to an academic, public-spirited, with an on-again-off-again relationship to Hungary’s Communist authorities. Emerence is a peasant, illiterate, impassive, abrupt, seemingly ageless. She lives alone in a house that no one else may enter, not even her closest relatives. She is Magda’s housekeeper and she has taken control over Magda’s household, becoming indispensable to her. And Emerence, in her way, has come to depend on Magda. They share a kind of love—at least until Magda’s long-sought success as a writer leads to a devastating revelation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Len Rix’s prizewinning translation of &lt;i&gt;The Door&lt;/i&gt; at last makes it possible for American readers to appreciate the masterwork of a major modern European writer.</description>

  <description>'Read, read, read, read, my unlearned reader! read...' Sterne's great comic novel is the fictional autobiography of Tristram Shandy, a hero who fails even to get born in the first two volumes. It contains some of the best-known and best-loved characters in English literature, including Uncle Toby, Corporal Trim, Parson Yorick, Dr Slop and the Widow Wadman. Beginning with Tristram's conception, the novel recounts his progress in 'this scurvy and disasterous world of ours', including his misnaming during baptism and his accidental circumcision by a falling sash-window at the age of five; unsurprisingly, Tristram declares that he has been 'the continual sport of what the world calls Fortune'. &lt;i&gt;Tristram Shandy&lt;/i&gt; also offers the narrator's 'opinions', at once facetious and highly serious, on books and learning in an age of rapidly expanding print culture, and on the changing understanding of the roles of writers and readers alike. This revised edition retains the first edition text incorporating Sterne's later changes, and adds two original Hogarth illustrations and a wealth of contextualizing information.</description>

  <description>We all came to the powwow for different reasons. The messy, dangling threads of our lives got pulled into a braid--tied to the back of everything we'd been doing all along to get us here. There will be death and playing dead, there will be screams and unbearable silences, forever-silences, and a kind of time-travel, at the moment the gunshots start, when we look around and see ourselves as we are, in our regalia, and something in our blood will recoil then boil hot enough to burn through time and place and memory. We'll go back to where we came from, when we were people running from bullets at the end of that old world. The tragedy of it all will be unspeakable, that we've been fighting for decades to be recognized as a present-tense people, modern and relevant, only to die in the grass wearing feathers."</description>

  <description>Structured around the forty questions Luiselli translates and asks undocumented Latin-American children facing deportation, &lt;i&gt;Tell Me How It Ends&lt;/i&gt; (an expansion of her 2016 &lt;i&gt;Freeman's &lt;/i&gt;essay of the same name) humanizes these young migrants and highlights the contradiction of the idea of America as a fiction for immigrants with the reality of racism and fear both here and back home."</description>

  <description>For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</description>

  <description>“When this book was first published it received some attention from the critics but none at all from the public. Nazism was finished in the bunker in Berlin and its death warrant signed on the bench at Nuremberg.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; That’s Milton Mayer, writing in a foreword to the 1966 edition of &lt;i&gt;They Thought They Were Free&lt;/i&gt;. He’s right about the critics: the book was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1956. General readers may have been slower to take notice, but over time they did—what we’ve seen over decades is that any time people, across the political spectrum, start to feel that freedom is threatened, the book experiences a ripple of word-of-mouth interest. And that interest has never been more prominent or potent than what we’ve seen in the past year.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They Thought They Were Free&lt;/i&gt; is an eloquent and provocative examination of the development of fascism in Germany. Mayer’s book is a study of ten Germans and their lives from 1933-45, based on interviews he conducted after the war when he lived in Germany. Mayer had a position as a research professor at the University of Frankfurt and lived in a nearby small Hessian town which he disguised with the name “Kronenberg.” “These ten men were not men of distinction,” Mayer noted, but they had been members of the Nazi Party; Mayer wanted to discover what had made them Nazis. His discussions with them of Nazism, the rise of the Reich, and mass complicity with evil became the backbone of this book, an indictment of the ordinary German that is all the more powerful for its refusal to let the rest of us pretend that our moment, our society, our country are fundamentally immune.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A new foreword to this edition by eminent historian of the Reich Richard J. Evans puts the book in historical and contemporary context. We live in an age of fervid politics and hyperbolic rhetoric. &lt;i&gt;They Thought They Were Free&lt;/i&gt; cuts through that, revealing instead the slow, quiet accretions of change, complicity, and abdication of moral authority that quietly mark the rise of evil.</description>

  <description>More popular in their day than Don Quxixote, Cervantes's Exemplary Stories (1613) surprise, challenge and delight. Ranging from the picaresque to the satirical, the Exemplary Stories defy the conventions of heroic chivalric literature through a combination of comic irony, moral ambiguity, realism, and sheer mirth. This new translation captures the full vigour of Cervantes's wit and make available two rarely printed gems, "The Illustrious Kitchen Maid" and "The Power of Blood."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sly debut story collection that conjures the experience of adolescence through the eyes of Chinese American girls growing up in New York City--for readers of Zadie Smith, Helen Oyeyemi, and Junot Diaz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fresh new voice emerges with the arrival of &lt;i&gt;Sour Heart&lt;/i&gt;, establishing Jenny Zhang as a frank and subversive interpreter of the immigrant experience in America. Her stories cut across generations and continents, moving from the fraught halls of a public school in Flushing, Queens, to the tumultuous streets of Shanghai, China, during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. In the absence of grown-ups, latchkey kids experiment on each other until one day the experiments turn violent; an overbearing mother abandons her artistic aspirations to come to America but relives her glory days through karaoke; and a shy loner struggles to master English so she can speak to God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated by the daughters of Chinese immigrants who fled imperiled lives as artists back home only to struggle to stay afloat--dumpster diving for food and scamming Atlantic City casino buses to make a buck--these seven stories showcase Zhang's compassion, moral courage, and a perverse sense of humor reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Portnoy's Complaint&lt;/i&gt;. A darkly funny and intimate rendering of girlhood, &lt;i&gt;Sour Heart &lt;/i&gt;examines what it means to belong to a family, to find your home, leave it, reject it, and return again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Sour Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Jenny Zhang arrives as a Chinese-American voice we haven't heard yet."--&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;W Magazine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Compelling writing about what it means to be a teenager . . . It's brilliant, it's dark, but it's also humorous and filled with love. . . . You'll feel compelled as a human."&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;Isaac Fitzgerald, &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Sour Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a revelation."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--Goop&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bursting at the seams with honesty, reality, and a tremendous amount of heart."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--PopSugar&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Zhang portrays the courage, humor, and complex emotions of these young women struggling to come to terms with who they are, their families, their bodies, and growing up in poverty, in seven stories that feel true to life."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Zhang's version of honesty goes way past the familiar, with passages that burst into bold, startling, brilliance."&lt;b&gt;--Miranda July&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"No terrain is more fraught than the inner world of a girl fighting to define herself, and no writer is better suited to serve as our guide than Jenny Zhang."&lt;b&gt;--Janet Mock, &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;author of &lt;i&gt;Redefining Realness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I emerged from &lt;i&gt;Sour Heart&lt;/i&gt; bleary-eyed and in love."&lt;b&gt;--Tavi Gevinson&lt;/b&gt;</description>

A Straussian reading might be that the book is highly critical of the decision to immigrate as immigration breaks families apart...]]>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Has liberalism failed because it has succeeded?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of the three dominant ideologies of the twentieth century—fascism, communism, and liberalism—only the last remains. This has created a peculiar situation in which liberalism’s proponents tend to forget that it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;an ideology and not the natural end-state of human political evolution. As Patrick Deneen argues in this provocative book, liberalism is built on a foundation of contradictions: it trumpets equal rights while fostering incomparable material inequality; its legitimacy rests on consent, yet it discourages civic commitments in favor of privatism; and in its pursuit of individual autonomy, it has given rise to the most far-reaching, comprehensive state system in human history.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Here, Deneen offers an astringent warning that the centripetal forces now at work on our political culture are not superficial flaws but inherent features of a system whose success is generating its own failure.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Although Maistre's influence within France was delayed until the Restoration, he is now acknowledged as the most eloquent spokesperson for continental conservatism. Arguing for a new alliance of throne and altar under a restored Bourbon monarchy, his work presents a providential interpretation of the French Revolution.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; • &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The haunting true story of the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California during the 70s and 80s, and of the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case—which was solved in April 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Introduction by Gillian Flynn •&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Afterword by Patton Oswalt&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it has been hailed as a modern true crime classic—one which fulfilled Michelle's dream: helping unmask the Golden State Killer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Written and set on the banks of the Neva, St Petersburg Dialogues is a startlingly relevant analysis of the human prospect at the end of the twentieth century. As the literary critic George Steiner has remarked, "the age of the Gulag and of Auschwitz, of famine and ubiquitous torture, ... nuclear threat, the ecological laying waste of our planet, the leap of endemic, possibly pandemic, illness out of the very matrix of libertarian progress" is exactly what Maistre foretold. In the Dialogues Maistre addressed a number of topics which are discussed briefly or not at all in his other works already available in English. These include an apologetic for traditional Christian beliefs about providence, reflections on the social role of the public executioner and the "divinity" of war, a critique of John Locke's sensationalist psychology, meditations on prayer and sacrifice, and a mini-course on "illuminism." The literary form is that of the "philosophical conversation" -- one that allowed Maistre to be deliberately provocative and to indulge his taste for paradox, a "methodical extravagance" that he judged particularly appropriate for the eighteenth-century salon. Translator and editor Richard Lebrun provides a full scholarly edition of this classic work, complete with an introduction, chronology, critical bibliography, and generous explanatory notes. The Dialogues will be of interest to scholars of literary history as well as the history of ideas.</description>

  <description>This casebook gathers a collection of ambitious essays about both parts of the novel (1605 and 1615) and also provides a general introduction and a bibliography. The essays range from Ramon Menendez Pidal's seminal study of how Cervantes dealt with chivalric literature to Erich Auerbachs polemical study of &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; as essentially a comic book by studying its mixture of styles, and include Leo Spitzer's masterful probe into the essential ambiguity of the novel through minute linguistic analysis of Cervantes' prose. The book includes pieces by other major Cervantes scholars, such as Manuel Duran and Edward C. Riley, as well as younger scholars like Georgina Dopico Black. All these essays ultimately seek to discover that which is peculiarly Cervantean in &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; and why it is considered to be the first modern novel.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the best-loved of Nabokov’s novels, &lt;i&gt;Pnin&lt;/i&gt; features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian émigré precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader’s deepest protective instinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serialized in &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; and published in book form in 1957, &lt;i&gt;Pnin&lt;/i&gt; brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.</description>

  <description>Edith Grossman's definitive English translation of the Spanish masterpiece. Widely regarded as the world's first modern novel, and one of the funniest and most tragic books ever written, &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote of La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. Unless you read Spanish, you've never read &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive account of the life and thought of the medieval Arab genius who wrote the &lt;i&gt;Muqaddima&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) is generally regarded as the greatest intellectual ever to have appeared in the Arab world--a genius who ranks as one of the world's great minds. Yet the author of the &lt;i&gt;Muqaddima&lt;/i&gt;, the most important study of history ever produced in the Islamic world, is not as well known as he should be, and his ideas are widely misunderstood. In this groundbreaking intellectual biography, Robert Irwin provides an engaging and authoritative account of Ibn Khaldun's extraordinary life, times, writings, and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irwin tells how Ibn Khaldun, who lived in a world decimated by the Black Death, held a long series of posts in the tumultuous Islamic courts of North Africa and Muslim Spain, becoming a major political player as well as a teacher and writer. Closely examining the &lt;i&gt;Muqaddima&lt;/i&gt;, a startlingly original analysis of the laws of history, and drawing on many other contemporary sources, Irwin shows how Ibn Khaldun's life and thought fit into historical and intellectual context, including medieval Islamic theology, philosophy, politics, literature, economics, law, and tribal life. Because Ibn Khaldun's ideas often seem to anticipate by centuries developments in many fields, he has often been depicted as more of a modern man than a medieval one, and Irwin's account of such misreadings provides new insights about the history of Orientalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, Irwin presents an Ibn Khaldun who was a creature of his time--a devout Sufi mystic who was obsessed with the occult and futurology and who lived in an often-strange world quite different from our own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The landmark publishing event of 2015 -- a full-colour illustrated edition of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with breathtaking illustrations by Jim Kay, winner of the Kate Greenaway medal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, J.K. Rowling's beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay's dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation's favourite children's book -- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Jim Kay has created over 100 stunning illustrations, making this deluxe format a perfect gift as much for a child being introduced to the series, as for the dedicated fan. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling's timeless classic, Jim Kay's glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous -- or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The inspiration for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's epic film and that &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; named one of the "Top 100 Books of All Time," &lt;i&gt;Berlin Alexanderplatz &lt;/i&gt;is considered one of the most important works of the Weimar Republic and twentieth century literature.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franz Biberkopf, pimp and petty thief, has just finished serving a term in prison for murdering his girlfriend. He's on his own in Weimar Berlin with its lousy economy and frontier morality, but Franz is determined to turn over new leaf, get ahead, make an honest man of himself, and so on and so forth. He hawks papers, chases girls, needs and bleeds money, gets mixed up in spite of himself in various criminal and political schemes, and when he tries to back out of them, it's at the cost of an arm. This is only the beginning of our modern everyman's multiplying misfortunes, but though Franz is more dupe than hustler, in the end, well, persistence is rewarded and things might be said to work out. Just like in a novel. Lucky Franz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Berlin, Alexanderplatz&lt;/i&gt; is one of great twentieth-century novels. Taking off from the work of Dos Passos and Joyce, Doblin depicts modern life in all its shocking violence, corruption, splendor, and horror. Michael Hofmann, celebrated for his translations of Joseph Roth and Franz Kafka, has prepared a new version, the first in over 75 years, in which Doblin's sublime and scurrilous masterpiece comes alive in English as never before.</description>

  <description>This comprehensive guide to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) offers parents balanced, reassuring, and authoritative information to help them understand and manage this challenging and often misunderstood condition. Based on the American Academy of Pediatrics' own clinical practice guidelines for ADHD and written in clear, accessible language, this book answers the common questions: &lt;i&gt;How is ADHD diagnosed? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;What are today's best treatment options?&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Will my child outgrow ADHD?&lt;/i&gt; Accurate, up-to-date findings on evaluation and diagnosis, coexisting conditions, and unproven treatments are provided. Also addressed are behaviors associated with the teenage years and what schools can do to support children with the condition. ADHD management strategies that balance the roles of behavior therapy, medications, and parenting techniques are suggested.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This charming pocket-sized edition contains the complete unabridged text and features the original cover illustration, painted by J. R. R. Tolkien himself. The perfect gift for little Hobbits everywhere! Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.</description>

  <description>Donald Trump's presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought we'd be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang--in a revolution or military coup--but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die--and how ours can be saved.</description>

  <description>Where the Sidewalk Ends turns forty! Celebrate with this anniversary edition that features an eye-catching commemorative red sticker. This classic poetry collection, which is both outrageously funny and profound, has been the most beloved of Shel Silverstein's poetry books for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the sidewalk ends, Shel Silverstein's world begins. There you'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is one of Parent &amp;amp; Child magazine's 100 Greatest Books for Kids. School Library Journal said, "Silverstein has an excellent sense of rhythm and rhyme and a good ear for alliteration and assonance that make these poems a pleasure to read aloud."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. In 1964, Shel's creativity continued to flourish as four more books were published in the same year—Don't Bump the Glump!, A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, and the beloved classic The Giving Tree. Later he continued to build his remarkable body of work with Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and Runny Babbit.</description>

  <description>The nine stories in Link's second collection are the spitting image of those in her acclaimed debut, Stranger Things Happen: effervescent blends of quirky humor and pathos that transform stock themes of genre fiction into the stuff of delicate lyrical fantasy. In "Stone Animals," a house's haunting takes the unusual form of hordes of rabbits that camp out nightly on the front lawn. This proves just one of several benign but inexplicable phenomena that begin to pull apart the family newly moved into the house as surely as a more sinister supernatural influence might. The title story beautifully captures the unpredictable potential of teenage lives through its account of a group of adolescent schoolfriends whose experiences subtly parallel events in a surreal TV fantasy series. Zombies serve as the focus for a young man's anxieties about his future in "Some Zombie Contingency Plans" and offer suggestive counterpoint to the lives of two convenience store clerks who serve them in "The Hortlak." Not only does Link find fresh perspectives from which to explore familiar premises, she also forges ingenious connections between disparate images and narrative approaches to suggest a convincing alternate logic that shapes the worlds of her highly original fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;The Faery Handbag (2004)&lt;br /&gt;The Hortlak (2003)&lt;br /&gt;The Cannon (2003)&lt;br /&gt;Stone Animals (2004)&lt;br /&gt;Catskin (2003)&lt;br /&gt;Some Zombie Contingency Plans (2005)&lt;br /&gt;The Great Divorce (2005)&lt;br /&gt;Magic for Beginners (2005)&lt;br /&gt;Lull (2002)</description>

  <description>First published in 1956, &lt;i&gt;Zama&lt;/i&gt; is now universally recognized as one of the masterpieces of modern Argentinean and Spanish-language literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in a style that is both precise and sumptuous, &lt;i&gt;Zama&lt;/i&gt; takes place in the last decade of the eighteenth century and describes the solitary, suspended existence of Don Diego de Zama, a highly placed servant of the Spanish crown who has been posted to Asunción, in remote Paraguay. Eaten up by pride, lust, petty grudges, and paranoid fantasies, Don Diego does as little as he possibly can while plotting an eventual transfer to Beunos Aires, where everything about his hopeless existence will, he is confident, be miraculously transformed and made good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Diego's slow, nightmarish slide into the abyss is not just a tale of one man's perdition but an exploration of existential, and very American, loneliness. Zama's stark, dreamlike prose and spare imagery make every word appear to emerge from an ocean of things left unsaid.</description>

  <description>Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better - and thus we don't like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is "the elephant in the brain." Such an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly - to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their "official" ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies designed to favor or discourage them. You won't see yourself - or the world - the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.</description>

  <description>Charles Holcombe begins by asking the question 'what is East Asia?' In the modern age, many of the features that made the region - now defined as including China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam - distinct have been submerged by the effects of revolution, politics or globalization. Yet, as an ancient civilization, the region had both an historical and cultural coherence. This shared past is at the heart of this ambitious book, which traces the story of East Asia from the dawn of history to the twenty-first century. The second edition has been imaginatively revised and expanded to place emphasis on cross-cultural interactions and connections, both within East Asia and beyond, with new material on Vietnam and modern pop culture. The second edition also features a Chinese character list, additional maps and new illustrations.</description>

  <description>For years, America has been plagued by slow economic growth and increasing inequality. Yet economists have long taught that there is a tradeoff between equity and efficiency-that is, between making a bigger pie and dividing it more fairly. That is why our current predicament is so puzzling: today, we are faced with both a stagnating economy and sky-high inequality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Captured Economy&lt;/em&gt; , Brink Lindsey and Steven M. Teles identify a common factor behind these twin ills: breakdowns in democratic governance that allow wealthy special interests to capture the policymaking process for their own benefit. They document the proliferation of regressive regulations that redistribute wealth and income up the economic scale while stifling entrepreneurship and innovation. When the state entrenches privilege by subverting market competition, the tradeoff between equity and efficiency no longer holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past four decades, new regulatory barriers have worked to shield the powerful from the rigors of competition, thereby inflating their incomes-sometimes to an extravagant degree. Lindsey and Teles detail four of the most important cases: subsidies for the financial sector's excessive risk taking, overprotection of copyrights and patents, favoritism toward incumbent businesses through occupational licensing schemes, and the NIMBY-led escalation of land use controls that drive up rents for everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freeing the economy from regressive regulatory capture will be difficult. Lindsey and Teles are realistic about the chances for reform, but they offer a set of promising strategies to improve democratic deliberation and open pathways for meaningful policy change. An original and counterintuitive interpretation of the forces driving inequality and stagnation, The Captured Economy will be necessary reading for anyone concerned about America's mounting economic problems and the social tensions they are sparking.</description>

  <description>William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.</description>

  <description>An award-winning memoir and instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that goes far beyond its riveting medical mystery, &lt;i&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful account of one woman’s struggle to recapture her identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a hospital room, strapped to her bed and unable to move or speak, she had no memory of how she’d gotten there. Days earlier, she had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: at the beginning of her first serious relationship and a promising career at a major New York newspaper. Now she was labeled violent, psychotic, a flight risk. What happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a swift and breathtaking narrative, Cahalan tells the astonishing true story of her descent into madness, her family’s inspiring faith in her, and the lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didn’t happen.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Paris Talks: Addresses Give by 'Abdul'l-Baha in 1911&lt;/i&gt; documents the extraordinary series of inspiring and uplifting public addresses 'Abdul'l-Baha gave on his historic visit to Paris in the early twentieth century. Despite advanced age and poor health, he set out from Palestine in 1911 on a momentous journey to Europe and North America to share the teachings and vision of the Baha'i Faith with the people of the West. Addressing such subjects as the nature of humankind, the soul, the Prophets of God, the establishment of world peace, the abolition of all forms of prejudice, the equality of women and men, the harmony of science and religion, the causes of war, and many other subjects, 'Abdul'l-Baha spoke in a profound yet simple manner that transcended social and cultural barriers. His deep spiritual wisdom remains as timely and soul-stirring today as it was a century ago.</description>

  <description>When Madame de Pompadour became the mistress of Louis XV, no one expected her to retain his affections for long. A member of the bourgeoisie rather than an aristocrat, she was physically too cold for the carnal Bourbon king, and had so many enemies that she could not travel publicly without risking a pelting of mud and stones. History has loved her little better. &lt;br /&gt;Nancy Mitford's delightfully candid biography recreates the spirit of 18th-century Versailles with its love of pleasure and treachery. We learn and see France increasingly overcome with class conflict. With a fiction writer's felicity, Mitford restores the royal mistress and celebrates her as a survivor, unsurpassed in "the art of living," who reigned as the most powerful woman in France for nearly twenty years</description>

  <description>When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world's most powerful internet company, she feels she's been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users' personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company's modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can't believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the world--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as the captivating story of one woman's ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>Here, in one volume: Marjane Satrapi's best-selling, internationally acclaimed graphic memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Satrapi's unforgettable childhood and coming of age within a large and loving family in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution; of the contradictions between private life and public life in a country plagued by political upheaval; of her high school years in Vienna facing the trials of adolescence far from her family; of her homecoming--both sweet and terrible; and, finally, of her self-imposed exile from her beloved homeland. It is the chronicle of a girlhood and adolescence at once outrageous and familiar, a young life entwined with the history of her country yet filled with the universal trials and joys of growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edgy, searingly observant, and candid, often heartbreaking but threaded throughout with raw humor and hard-earned wisdom--&lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning work from one of the most highly regarded, singularly talented graphic artists at work today.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23390821-to-kill-a-mockingbird" rel="nofollow"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>In this compact work, Esslemont comprehensively yet succinctly sets forth the teachings of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet and Founder of the Baha'i Faith. He outlines the religion's early history; explains its theology; incorporates extracts from Baha'i scripture; and provides information on Baha'i spiritual practices. This is essential reading for students of comparative religion.</description>

  <description>Seneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)--on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness--and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, "Apocolocyntosis" (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 124 epistles are collected in Volumes IV-VI of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.</description>

  <description>A historian of fascism offers a guide for surviving and resisting America’s turn towards authoritarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 9th, millions of Americans woke up to the impossible: the election of Donald Trump as president. Against all predictions, one of the most-disliked presidential candidates in history had swept the electoral college, elevating a man with open contempt for democratic norms and institutions to the height of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timothy Snyder is one of the most celebrated historians of the Holocaust. In his books &lt;i&gt;Bloodlands&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Black Earth&lt;/i&gt;, he has carefully dissected the events and values that enabled the rise of Hitler and Stalin and the execution of their catastrophic policies. With &lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, Snyder draws from the darkest hours of the twentieth century to provide hope for the twenty-first. As he writes, “Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism and communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt; is a call to arms and a guide to resistance, with invaluable ideas for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;How to Live&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/i&gt;, a philosopher asks how ancient Stoicism can help us flourish today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever we worry about what to eat, how to love, or simply how to be happy, we are worrying about how to lead a good life. No goal is more elusive. In &lt;em&gt;How to Be a Stoic&lt;/em&gt;, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us–and &lt;em&gt;How to Be a Stoic&lt;/em&gt; is the essential guide.</description>

  <description>Soon to be a major motion picture—Stephen King’s terrifying, classic #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, “a landmark in American literature” (&lt;i&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/i&gt;)—about seven adults who return to their hometown to confront a nightmare they had first stumbled on as teenagers…an evil without a name: &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Derry, Maine. It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But the promise they made twenty-eight years ago calls them reunite in the same place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city’s children. Now, children are being murdered again and their repressed memories of that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster lurking in Derry’s sewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of Stephen King know that Derry, Maine, is a place with a deep, dark hold on the author. It reappears in many of his books, including &lt;i&gt;Bag of Bones&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hearts in Atlantis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;11/22/63&lt;/i&gt;. But it all starts with &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Stephen King’s most mature work” (&lt;i&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/i&gt;), “&lt;i&gt;It &lt;/i&gt;will overwhelm you… to be read in a well-lit room only” (&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>In its adventurous happenings, its abductions, duels, and sexual intrigues, &lt;i&gt;A Hero of Our Time&lt;/i&gt; looks backward to the tales of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron, so beloved by Russian society in the 1820s and '30s. In the character of its protagonist, Pechorin, the archetypal Russian antihero, Lermontov's novel looks forward to the subsequent glories and passion of Russian literature that it helped, in great measure, to make possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A succinct, powerful explanation of why much of what we think about the incarceration boom is probably wrong." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-Bloomberg View&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A groundbreaking examination of our system of imprisonment, revealing the true causes of mass incarceration as well as the best path to reform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1970s, the United States had an incarceration rate comparable to those of other liberal democracies&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;and that rate had held steady for over 100 years. Yet today, though the US is home to only about 5 percent of the world's population, we hold nearly one quarter of its prisoners. Mass incarceration is now widely considered one of the biggest social and political crises of our age. How did we get to this point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Locked In &lt;/i&gt;is a revelatory investigation into the root causes of mass incarceration by one of the most exciting scholars in the country. Having spent fifteen years studying the data on imprisonment, John Pfaff takes apart the reigning consensus created by Michelle Alexander and other reformers, revealing that the most widely accepted explanations&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;the failed War on Drugs, draconian sentencing laws, an increasing reliance on private prisons&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;tell us much less than we think. Pfaff urges us to look at other factors instead, including a major shift in prosecutor behavior that occurred in the mid-1990s, when prosecutors began bringing felony charges against arrestees about twice as often as they had before. He describes a fractured criminal justice system, in which counties don't pay for the people they send to state prisons, and in which white suburbs set law and order agendas for more-heavily minority cities. And he shows that if we hope to significantly reduce prison populations, we have no choice but to think differently about how to deal with people convicted of violent crimes&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;and why some people are violent in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An authoritative, clear-eyed account of a national catastrophe, &lt;i&gt;Locked In &lt;/i&gt;transforms our understanding of what ails the American system of punishment and ultimately forces us to reconsider how we can build a more equitable and humane society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Giorgio Pellegrini, the hero of &lt;i&gt;The Goodbye Kiss&lt;/i&gt;, has been living an “honest” life for eleven years. But that’s about to change. His lawyer has been deceiving him and now Giorgio is forced into service as an unwilling errand boy for an organized crime syndicate. At one time, Giorgio wouldn’t have thought twice about robbing, kidnapping and killing in order to get what he wanted, but these days he realizes he’s too old in the tooth to face his enemies head-on. To return to his peaceful life as a successful businessman he’s going to have to find another way to shake off the mob. Fortunately, Giorgio’s circumstances may have changed, but deep down he’s still the ruthless killer he used to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Experience the blazing, surreal sensation of a fever dream…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman named Amanda lies dying in a rural hospital clinic. A boy named David sits beside her. She’s not his mother. He’s not her child. Together, they tell a haunting story of broken souls, toxins, and the power and desperation of family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; is a nightmare come to life, a ghost story for the real world, a love story and a cautionary tale. One of the freshest new voices to come out of the Spanish language and translated into English for the first time, Samanta Schweblin creates an aura of strange psychological menace and otherworldly reality in this absorbing, unsettling, taut novel.</description>

  <description>È il racconto di come gli animali di una fattoria si ribellino e, dopo aver cacciato il proprietario, tentino di crare un nuovo ordine fondato su un concetto utopistico di uguaglianza. Ma ben presto emerge tra loro una nuova classe di burocrati, i maiali, che con la loro astuzia, la loro cupidigia e il loro egoismo s'impongono in modo prepotente e tirannico sugli altri animali più docili e semplici d'animo. Gli elevati ideali di uguaglianza e fraternità proclamati al tempo della rivoluzione vittoriosa vengono traditi e, sotto l'oppressione di Napoleon, il grosso maiale che riesce ad accentrare in sé tutte le leve del potere e ad appropriarsi degli utili della fattoria, tutti gli altri animali finiscono per conoscere gli stessi maltrattamenti e le stesse privazioni di prima. L'acuta satira orwelliana verso un certo tipo di totalitarismo, che ha avuto in Stalin la sua esemplificazione più clamorosa, è unita in questo apologo a una felicità inventiva e a un'energia stilistica che pongono "La fattoria degli animali" sulla linea della grande tradizione libellistica inglese del '700.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is a Vietnam War novel unlike any other. The narrator, one of the most arresting of recent fiction, is a man of two minds and divided loyalties, a half-French half-Vietnamese communist sleeper agent living in America after the end of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. But, unbeknownst to the general, this captain is an undercover operative for the communists, who instruct him to add his own name to the list and accompany the general to America. As the general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, the captain continues to observe the group, sending coded letters to an old friend who is now a higher-up within the communist administration. Under suspicion, the captain is forced to contemplate terrible acts in order to remain undetected. And when he falls in love, he finds that his lofty ideals clash violently with his loyalties to the people close to him, a contradiction that may prove unresolvable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping spy novel, a moving story of love and friendship, and a layered portrayal of a young man drawn into extreme politics, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today.</description>

  <description>The Winter's Tale, one of Shakespeare's very late plays, is filled with improbabilities. Before the conclusion, one character comments that what we are about to see, "Were it but told you, should be hooted at / Like an old tale."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes murderous passions, man-eating bears, princes and princesses in disguise, death by drowning and by grief, oracles, betrayal, and unexpected joy. Yet the play, which draws much of its power from Greek myth, is grounded in the everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A "winter's tale" is one told or read on a long winter's night. Paradoxically, this winter's tale is ideally seen rather than read-though the imagination can transform words into vivid action. Its shift from tragedy to comedy, disguises, and startling exits and transformations seem addressed to theater audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authoritative edition of The Winter's Tale from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play&lt;br /&gt;-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play&lt;br /&gt;-Scene-by-scene plot summaries&lt;br /&gt;-A key to the play's famous lines and phrases&lt;br /&gt;-An introduction to reading Shakespeare's language&lt;br /&gt;-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play&lt;br /&gt;-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books&lt;br /&gt;-An annotated guide to further reading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essay by Stephen Orgel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe. In addition to exhibitions open to the public throughout the year, the Folger offers a full calendar of performances and programs. For more information, visit Folger.edu.</description>

  <description>"It began as a mistake." By middle age, Henry Chinaski has lost more than twelve years of his life to the U.S. Postal Service. In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This classic 1971 novel--the one that catapulted its author to national fame--is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Sorrows of Young Werther&lt;/em&gt; propelled Goethe to instant fame when it first appeared in 1774. Goethe's story of a sensitive young artist--an alienated youth of searching introspection and passionate intensity--captured the Romantic sensibility of the day and led to a wave of imitations. Translated by the award-winning author David Constantine, this new edition captures the novel's lyric clarity and powerful immediacy. In addition, Constantine's critical introduction sheds light on the autobiographical background, the novel's epistolary form and structure, and &lt;em&gt;Werther&lt;/em&gt;'s reception and afterlife. The explanatory notes illuminate contemporary allusions, literary references, and the parallels with Goethe's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Series&lt;/strong&gt; For over 100 years &lt;strong&gt;Oxford World's Classics&lt;/strong&gt; has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the most popular and most quoted books in English, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the creation of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898), a distinguished scholar, mathematician and author who wrote under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. Written for young readers but enjoyed equally by adults, the fantastic tale transformed children's literature, liberating it from didactic constraints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is deeply but gently satiric, enlivened with an imaginative plot and brilliant use of nonsense, as it relates Alice's adventures in a bizarre, topsy-turvey land underground. There she encounters a cast of strange characters and fanciful beasts, including the White Rabbit, March Hare, and Mad Hatter, the sleepy Dormouse and grinning Cheshire Cat,the Mock Turtle, the dreadful Queen of Hearts, and unusual creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir John Tenniel's complete original illustrations bring the story and all the characters to life in this beloved classic that has delighted readers and listeners since its first publication in 1865.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>As both painter and poet, William Blake (1757–1827) was a powerful and visionary artist whose two early collections of poetry, &lt;i&gt;Songs of Innocence&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Songs of Experience&lt;/i&gt;, contain memorable lyric verses embodying the emerging spirit of Romanticism. The two works were published together in 1794 with the subtitle, "Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul." &lt;br /&gt;The poems of &lt;i&gt;Songs of Innocence&lt;/i&gt; describe childhood states of naturalness and purity in delicately beautiful lyrics that reveal a child's unspoiled and beatific view of life and human nature. In &lt;i&gt;Songs of Experience&lt;/i&gt; the mood and tone darken, the poems suggesting the bitter corruptions and disillusionment that await the innocent. The contrast between the two sets of lyrics is perhaps at its most acute in the poems "The Lamb" and "The Tyger," the latter ultimately expressing wonderment at the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of good and evil. The full texts of all the poems in the 1794 edition of both collections are included in this volume.</description>

  <description>Loosely based on the Odyssey, this landmark of modern literature follows ordinary Dubliners in 1904. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus, his wife Molly, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, Joyce pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. Captivating experimental techniques range from interior monologues to exuberant wordplay and earthy humor. A major achievement in 20th century literature.</description>

      <![CDATA[Bite-sized distillations of the spiritual teachings of the world's religions presented in the elevated, lofty language that the Bahai'i scriptures translated into English are well known for. Perfect for daily meditations if you're into that sort of thing. Nice edition too. Love the cover art. ]]>

  <description>From its beginning—“My English professor’s ass was so beautiful.”—to its end—“You can actually learn to have grace. And that’s heaven.”—poet, essayist and performer Eileen Myles’ chronicle transmits an energy and vividness that will not soon leave its readers. Her story of a young female writer, discovering both her sexuality and her own creative drive in the meditative and raucous environment that was New York City in its punk and indie heyday, is engrossing, poignant, and funny. This is a voice from the underground that redefines the meaning of the word.</description>

      <![CDATA[A very uneven novel telling the story of a struggling poet in New York City in the 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. In content it's more a personal memoir without a personality. Stylistically, it's a bit lackluster. Still, I've a soft spot for bohemian lifestyle books like this. ]]>

  <description>In these provocative, powerful essays acclaimed writer/journalist Jeff Chang (&lt;i&gt;Can’t Stop Won’t Stop&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Who We Be&lt;/i&gt;) takes an incisive and wide-ranging look at the recent tragedies and widespread protests that have shaken the country. Through deep reporting with key activists and thinkers, passionately personal writing, and distinguished cultural criticism, &lt;i&gt;We Gon’ Be Alright&lt;/i&gt; links #BlackLivesMatter to #OscarsSoWhite, Ferguson to Washington D.C., the Great Migration to resurgent nativism. Chang explores the rise and fall of the idea of “diversity,” the roots of student protest, changing ideas about Asian Americanness, and the impact of a century of racial separation in housing. He argues that resegregation is the unexamined condition of our time, the undoing of which is key to moving the nation forward to racial justice and cultural equity.</description>

      <![CDATA[It can be difficult to evaluate a book like this. Its subject, the resegregation of the United States, is one of the most, if not the most, important issue confronting the nation today. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a monocausal analysis of the issue - that of critical race theory. As such...]]>

  <description>Diogenes the Cynic is famed for walking the streets with a lamp in daylight, looking for an honest man. His biting wit and eccentric behavior were legendary, and it was by means of his renowned aphorisms that his moral teachings were transmitted. He scorned the conventions of civilized life, and his ascetic lifestyle and caustic opinions informed the Cynic philosophy and later influenced Stoicism. This unique edition also covers his immediate successors, such as Crates, his wife Hipparchia, and the witty moral preacher Bion. The contrasting teachings of the Cyrenaic school, founded by Aristippos, a pleasure-loving friend of Socrates, complete the volume, together with a selection of apocryphal letters.&lt;br /&gt;About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A portrait of the artist as a young woman. A novel about not just discovering but inventing oneself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1995, and email is new. Selin, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, arrives for her freshman year at Harvard. She signs up for classes in subjects she has never heard of, befriends her charismatic and worldly Serbian classmate, Svetlana, and, almost by accident, begins corresponding with Ivan, an older mathematics student from Hungary. Selin may have barely spoken to Ivan, but with each email they exchange, the act of writing seems to take on new and increasingly mysterious meanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the school year, Ivan goes to Budapest for the summer, and Selin heads to the Hungarian countryside, to teach English in a program run by one of Ivan's friends. On the way, she spends two weeks visiting Paris with Svetlana. Selin's summer in Europe does not resonate with anything she has previously heard about the typical experiences of American college students, or indeed of any other kinds of people. For Selin, this is a journey further inside herself: a coming to grips with the ineffable and exhilarating confusion of first love, and with the growing consciousness that she is doomed to become a writer.</description>

  <description>In his long-awaited first novel, American master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices—living and dead, historical and invented—to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?</description>

  <description>A leading German metaphysician of the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) exerted an influence far beyond the hermetic world of philosophy, with adherents ranging from Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Mann. Among Schopenhauer's chief contributions to the field of philosophy are his rejection of the idealism of his contemporaries and his embrace of a practical variety of materialism. He jettisons the traditional philosophic jargon for a brisk, compelling style that employs direct terms to express the metaphysics of the will.&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Wisdom of Life&lt;/i&gt;, an essay from Schopenhauer's final work, &lt;i&gt;Parerga und Paralipomena&lt;/i&gt; (1851), the philosopher favors individual strength of will and independent, reasoned deliberation over the tendency to act on irrational impulses. He examines the ways in which life can be arranged to derive the highest degree of pleasure and success, presents guidelines to achieving this full and rich manner of living, and advises that even a life well lived must always aspire to grander heights. Abounding in subjects of enduring relevance, Schopenhauer's highly readable work appears here in an excellent translation.</description>

  <description>Since Alexis de Tocqueville, restlessness has been accepted as a signature American trait. Our willingness to move, take risks, and adapt to change have produced a dynamic economy and a tradition of innovation from Ben Franklin to Steve Jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, according to legendary blogger, economist and bestelling author Tyler Cowen, is that Americans today have broken from this tradition—we’re working harder than ever to &lt;i&gt;avoid&lt;/i&gt; change. We're moving residences less, marrying people more like ourselves and choosing our music and our mates based on algorithms that wall us off from anything that might be too new or too different. Match.com matches us in love. Spotify and Pandora match us in music. Facebook matches us to just about everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this “matching culture” brings tremendous positives: music we like, partners who make us happy, neighbors who want the same things. We’re more &lt;i&gt;comfortable&lt;/i&gt;. But, according to Cowen, there are significant collateral downsides attending this comfort, among them heightened inequality and segregation and decreased incentives to innovate and create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Social Stagnation&lt;/i&gt; argues that this cannot go on forever. We are postponing change, due to our near-sightedness and extreme desire for comfort, but ultimately this will make change, when it comes, harder. The forces unleashed by the Great Stagnation will eventually lead to a major fiscal and budgetary crisis: impossibly expensive rentals for our most attractive cities, worsening of residential segregation, and a decline in our work ethic. The only way to avoid this difficult future is for Americans to force themselves out of their comfortable slumber—to embrace their restless tradition again.</description>

  <description>An NYRB Classics Original&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hero of The Invisibility Cloak lives in contemporary Beijing—where everyone is doing their best to hustle up the ladder of success while shouldering an ever-growing burden of consumer goods—and he’s a loser. Well into his forties, he’s divorced (and still doting on his ex), childless, and living with his sister (her husband wants him out) in an apartment at the edge of town with a crack in the wall the wind from the north blows through while he gets by, just, by making customized old-fashioned amplifiers for the occasional rich audio-obsessive. He has contempt for his clients and contempt for himself. The only things he really likes are Beethoven and vintage speakers. Then an old friend tips him off about a special job—a little risky but just don’t ask too many questions—and can it really be that this hopeless loser wins?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provocative and seriously funny exercise in the social fantastic by the brilliantly original Ge Fei, one of China’s finest living writers, is among the most original works of fiction to come out of China in recent years. It is sure to appeal to readers of Haruki Murakami and other fabulists of contemporary irreality.</description>

  <description>Sam Spade is hired by the fragrant Miss Wonderley to track down her sister, who has eloped with a louse called Floyd Thursby. But Miss Wonderley is in fact the beautiful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and when Spade's partner Miles Archer is shot while on Thursby's trail, Spade finds himself both hunter and hunted: can he track down the jewel-encrusted bird, a treasure worth killing for, before the Fat Man finds him?</description>

His disdain for authority is especially appealing to me. <br /><br />The four stars is for the book itself though. The story. I listened to the audiobook this time around. I...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of our most important public intellectuals reveals the hidden history of our current global crisis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modernity, secularism, development, and progress have long been viewed by the powerful few as benign ideals for the many. Today, however, botched experiments in nation-building, democracy, industrialization, and urbanization visibly scar much of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As once happened in Europe, the wider embrace of revolutionary politics, mass movements, technology, the pursuit of wealth, and individualism has cast billions adrift in a literally demoralized world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was from among the ranks of the disaffected and the spiritually disorientated, that the militants of the nineteenth century arose—angry young men who became cultural nationalists in Germany, messianic revolutionaries in Russia, bellicose chauvinists in Italy, and anarchist terrorists internationally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many more people today, unable to fulfill the promises—freedom, stability, and prosperity—of a globalized economy, are increasingly susceptible to demagogues and their simplifications. A common reaction among them is intense hatred of supposed villains, the invention of enemies, attempts to recapture a lost golden age, unfocused fury and self-empowerment through spectacular violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Age of Anger&lt;/i&gt;, Pankaj Mishra explores the origins of the great wave of paranoid hatreds that seem inescapable in our close-knit world—from American “shooters” and ISIS to Trump, Modi, and racism and misogyny on social media.</description>

  <description>This book presents the theoretical and practical arguments for liberalism. Mises contrasts liberalism with other conceivable systems of social organization such as socialism, communism, and fascism. He is also more specific here than elsewhere in applying the liberal program to economic policy, domestic and foreign.</description>

  <description>An unconventional weight loss tale from an unconventional personality—Penn Jillette tells how he lost 100 pounds with his trademark outrageous sense of humor and biting social commentary that makes this success story anything but ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legendary magician Penn Jillette was approaching his sixtieth birthday. Topping 330 pounds and saddled with a systolic blood pressure reading over 200, he knew he was at a dangerous crossroads: if he wanted to see his small children grow up, he needed to change. And then came Crazy Ray. A former NASA scientist and an unconventional, passionate innovator, Ray Cronise saved Penn Jillette’s life with his wild “potato diet.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Presto&lt;/i&gt;, Jillette takes us along on his journey from skepticism to the inspiring, life-changing momentum that transformed the magician’s body and mind. He describes the process in hilarious detail, as he performs his Las Vegas show, takes meetings with Hollywood executives, hangs out with his celebrity friends and fellow eccentric performers, all while remaining a dedicated husband and father. Throughout, he weaves in his views on sex, religion, and pop culture, making his story a refreshing, genre-busting account. Outspoken, frank, and bitingly clever, &lt;i&gt;Presto&lt;/i&gt; is an incisive, rollicking read.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca&lt;/em&gt;, representative selections from Seneca's writings offer the reader an excellent introduction to the range of his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selections are drawn from the essays, or dialogues, and the "Consolations;" from the treatises, of which "On Clemency," addressed to the young Nero, is included here; and from the &lt;em&gt;Letters to Lucilius&lt;/em&gt;, which have to do not only with philosophical subjects but also with Seneca's personal experiences, such as journeys and visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moses Hadas has selected letters and essays which reveal Seneca's major philosophical themes—the relationship of the individual to society and to the gods; the meaning of pain and misfortune; man's attitudes to change, time, and death; and the nature of the highest good and of the happy life. In his Introduction, Professor Hadas discusses Seneca's life and work, tracing the history of his reputation; comments on Seneca's style; and outlines the origins and tenets of Stoicism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;De Providentia, De Brevitate Vitæ, De Tranquillitate Animi, Ad Helviam matrem De consolatione, De Clementia, Epistulae morales ad Lucilium (selection))</description>

  <description>The Verbal Behavior (VB) approach is a form of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), that is based on B.F. Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior and works particularly well with children with minimal or no speech abilities. In this book Dr. Mary Lynch Barbera draws on her own experiences as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst and also as a parent of a child with autism to explain VB and how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This step-by-step guide provides an abundance of information about how to help children develop better language and speaking skills, and also explains how to teach non-vocal children to use sign language. An entire chapter focuses on ways to reduce problem behavior, and there is also useful information on teaching toileting and other important self-help skills, that would benefit any child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book will enable parents and professionals unfamiliar with the principles of ABA and VB to get started immediately using the Verbal Behavior approach to teach children with autism and related disorders.</description>

  <description>An epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, &lt;b&gt;Blood Meridian &lt;/b&gt;brilliantly subverts the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the "wild west." Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into the nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher's Note:&lt;/b&gt; The 25th Anniversary Edition has been reset, causing the text to reflow. Page references based on earlier editions will no longer apply, so Vintage Books has compiled the following chart as a conversion aid.

  <description>When Felix is deposed as artistic director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival by his devious assistant and longtime enemy, his production of The Tempest is canceled and he is heartbroken. Reduced to a life of exile in rural southern Ontario—accompanied only by his fantasy daughter, Miranda, who died twelve years ago—Felix devises a plan for retribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually he takes a job teaching Literacy Through Theatre to the prisoners at the nearby Burgess Correctional Institution, and is making a modest success of it when an auspicious star places his enemies within his reach. With the help of their own interpretations, digital effects, and the talents of a professional actress and choreographer, the Burgess Correctional Players prepare to video their Tempest. Not surprisingly, they view Caliban as the character with whom they have the most in common. However, Felix has another twist in mind, and his enemies are about to find themselves taking part in an interactive and illusion-ridden version of The Tempest that will change their lives forever. But how will Felix deal with his invisible Miranda’s decision to take a part in the play?</description>

Its author [Yoss] is one of the most celebrated—and controversial—Cuban writers of science fiction…. Reminiscent of Douglas Adams—but even more so, the satire of Rabelais and Swift.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the playfulness and ingenuity of Douglas Adams, the Cuban science-fiction master Yoss delivers a space opera of intergalactic proportions with &lt;i&gt;Super Extra Grande&lt;/i&gt;, the winner of the twentieth annual UPC Science Fiction Award in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a distant future in which Latin Americans have pioneered faster-than-light space travel, Dr. Jan Amos Sangan Dongo has a job with large and unusual responsibilities: he’s a veterinarian who specializes in treating enormous alien animals. Mountain-sized amoebas, multisex species with bizarre reproductive processes, razor-nailed, carnivorous humanoid hunters: Dr. Sangan has seen it all. When a colonial conflict threatens the fragile peace between the galaxy’s seven intelligent species, he must embark on a daring mission through the insides of a gigantic creature and find two swallowed ambassadors—who also happen to be his competing love interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, witty, raunchy, and irrepressibly vivacious, &lt;i&gt;Super Extra Grande&lt;/i&gt; is a rare specimen in the richly parodic tradition of Cuban science fiction, and could only have been written by a Cuban heavy-metal rock star with a biology degree: the inimitable Yoss.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two terrifying classics by “the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas Ligotti’s debut collection, &lt;i&gt;Songs of a Dead Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;, and his second, &lt;i&gt;Grimscribe&lt;/i&gt;, permanently inscribed a new name in the pantheon of horror fiction. Influenced by the strange terrors of Lovecraft and Poe and by the brutal absurdity of Kafka, Ligotti eschews cheap, gory thrills for his own brand of horror, which shocks at the deepest, existential, levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ligotti’s stories take on decaying cities and lurid dreamscapes in a style ranging from rich, ornamental prose to cold, clinical detachment. His raw and experimental work lays bare the unimportance of our world and the sickening madness of the human condition. Like the greatest writers of cosmic horror, Ligotti bends reality until it cracks, opening fissures through which he invites us to gaze on the unsettling darkness of the abyss below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, a novel about violence, love, and religion in modern India&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a train bound for the seaside town of Jarmuli, known for its temples, three elderly women meet a young documentary filmmaker named Nomi, whose braided hair, tattoos, and foreign air set her apart. At a brief stop en route, the women witness a sudden assault on Nomi that leaves her stranded as the train pulls away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in Jarmuli, among pilgrims, priests, and ashrams, the women disembark only to find that Nomi has managed to arrive on her own. What is someone like her, clearly not a worshipper, doing in this remote place? Over the next five days, the women live out their long-planned dream of a holiday together; their temple guide pursues a forbidden love; and Nomi is joined by a photographer to scout locations for a documentary. As their lives overlap and collide, Nomi's past comes into focus, and the serene surface of the town is punctured by violence and abuse as Jarmuli is revealed as a place with a long, dark history that transforms all who encounter it. A haunting, vibrant novel that was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature and short-listed for the Hindu Literary Prize, Anuradha Roy's &lt;i&gt;Sleeping on Jupiter&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliantly told story of contemporary India from an internationally acclaimed writer.</description>

  <description>Cinephilia has recently experienced a powerful resurgence, one enabled by new media technologies of the digital revolution. One strong continuity between today's "new cinephilia" and the classical cinephilia of the 1950s is the robust sociability which these new technologies have facilitated. Each activity of today's cinephilic practice - viewing, thinking, reading and writing about films - is marked by an unprecedented amount of social interaction facilitated by the Internet. As with their classical counterparts, the thoughts and writings of today's cinephiles are born from a vigorous and broad-ranging cinephilic conversation. Further, by dramatically lowering the economic barriers to publication, the Internet has also made possible new hybrid forms and outlets of cinephilic writing that draw freely from scholarly, journalistic and literary models. This book both describes and theorises how and where cinephilia lives and thrives today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Girish Shambu is not only a cinephile but a collector, bringing in discussions from around the world (a world both physical and digital). While he has long been an essential resource on the web, with The New Cinephilia he has written a necessary, compelling and elegant book that takes stock of the state of cinephilia in the twenty-first century, and the conditions that are changing it but also renewing its vitality. Shambu shows that cinephilia is not a solitary activity but one that is-and continues to be-defined with conversation, whether in person, through published texts, or across social media platforms. But most of all Shambu has written a plea for writing: for a new cinephilic and academic writing about film, a writing that is alive to the fascination of moments and to the insights of sustained reflection. This is a book about what it means to be a cinephile right now, what it means to embrace the cinema and to do so within the contemporary world. - Daniel Morgan, University of Chicago</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Measure for Measure&lt;/i&gt; is among the most passionately discussed of Shakespeare’s plays. In it, a duke temporarily removes himself from governing his city-state, deputizing a member of his administration, Angelo, to enforce the laws more rigorously. Angelo chooses as his first victim Claudio, condemning him to death because he impregnated Juliet before their marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudio’s sister Isabella, who is entering a convent, pleads for her brother’s life. Angelo attempts to extort sex from her, but Isabella preserves her chastity. The duke, in disguise, eavesdrops as she tells her brother about Angelo’s behavior, then offers to ally himself with her against Angelo.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautifully packaged, gifty daily devotional of Stoic wisdom, from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern readers praise Stoic philosophy for its unique blend of practicality and wisdom. But it's admittedly hard for the average reader to decipher the Dover Thrift edition of Marcus Aurelius' work. The antiquated, needlessly formal language of most modern translations is stripped down in this book, revealing powerful aphorisms that cut straight to the heart of our day-to-day challenges.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Presented in a page-per-day format, this daily resource of Stoic inspiration combines new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, Zeno by Stephen Hanselman with calls to further reflection--and action--by Ryan Holiday. Arranged topically following the same three movements (Perception, Action, Will) that Holiday used in&lt;i&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/i&gt;, this guide features twelve principles for overcoming obstacles and achieving greater satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aimed at the high-octane, action-oriented, doers of our wired world, this book is intended to open to them a new daily ritual and a new orientation that will bring balanced action, insight, effectiveness, and serenity.</description>

      <![CDATA[Stoic Week is always a pleasure to take part in. This is the handbook for this year. I'll probably use it a few more times during the year. Worth a look. I have a PDF if anyone is interested. ]]>
