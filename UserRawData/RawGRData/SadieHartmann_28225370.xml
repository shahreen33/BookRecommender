  <description>In his first novel, This Is Horror and Wonderland Award-nominated author Nicholas Day invites you to take a journey into a Hell that is at once uncomfortably familiar, yet unlike anything you've ever encountered before: a surveyor finds himself pursued by flesh-eating donkeys in the furthest reaches of Oregon's desert; a mass-murderer leaves the sanctity of his mountain home to pursue a long-lost love, his guide an otherworldly raven possessed by a 19th century American humorist; in nearby Klamath Falls, two estranged childhood friends set off to find a missing father with the help of two aging cowboys; and, a prisoner in her own home sees a vision of death and knows there is no escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain is proselytizing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death is the one, true faith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And everyone worships in their due time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gates of Nihil are wide open and waiting to... &lt;i&gt;Grind Your Bones to Dust&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>It began as a vacation to the Cook Islands. But when seven friends are lost in the South Pacific after their boat goes down in a storm, they must survive at sea for several days in a small raft. Blown miles off course from their original position, and deep into open waters, they eventually encounter a small uncharted island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grateful to be alive, they begin their quest for survival, hopeful they’ll be rescued sooner than later. But the island is not the paradise it appears to be. Instead, it is a place of horror, death, torture and evil, of terrible secrets thought long buried and forgotten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are not alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something guards those horrible secrets, something evil and relentlessly violent, an ancient horror born of rage and vengeance, a blood-crazed predator that lives to kill and will stop at nothing to protect the island from those intruding upon its dark legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The savage is loose, and there is no escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVAGES, the new novel from Greg F. Gifune&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's supernatural epic, The Fearing, concludes in Book Four: Earth &amp;amp; Ember as maniacal leader Tim Jacoby solidifies his militaristic control over his followers by choosing who will live and who will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new destination in sight, survivors fleeing the encroaching darkness that's devouring everything in its path arrive at Graceland to re-establish society. But it could also change it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as humanity's extinction appears on the horizon, Adam and Jelnik contemplate their mysterious roles in the end of all things. Under a silver arch, they confront all that remains of humanity and, together, gather to face what waits within the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything ends here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive</description>

  <description>Necrosaurus Rex tells the tale of Martin, a simple janitor, who takes an unfortunate trip through time, becomes a violent mutant, and the father of us all. There's 14 billion years crushed inside these pages, and most of them are pretty nasty. This book is a jet black rumination on the concept of miracles and the creation of the universe, a narrative whose lineage exists somewhere between Moravagine, Maldoror, and David Copperfield. Genesis, the Crucifixion, and Revelations reimagined as a transgressive nightmare. This is Necrosaurus Rex.</description>

  <description>One million years of evolution didn't change our nature. Nor did it bury the horrors predating civilisation. Ancient rites, old deities and savage ways can reappear in the places you least expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifestyle journalist Katrine escaped past traumas by moving to a coast renowned for seaside holidays and natural beauty. But when a vast hoard of human remains and prehistoric artefacts is discovered in nearby Brickburgh, a hideous shadow engulfs her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helene, a disillusioned lone parent, lost her brother, Lincoln, six years ago. Disturbing subterranean noises he recorded prior to vanishing, draw her to Brickburgh's caves. A site where early humans butchered each other across sixty thousand years. Upon the walls, images of their nameless gods remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst rumours of drug plantations and new sightings of the mythical red folk, it also appears that the inquisitive have been disappearing from this remote part of the world for years. A rural idyll where outsiders are unwelcome and where an infernal power is believed to linger beneath the earth. A timeless supernormal influence that only the desperate would dream of confronting. But to save themselves and those they love, and to thwart a crimson tide of pitiless barbarity, Kat and Helene are given no choice. They were involved and condemned before they knew it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The Reddening' is an epic story of folk and prehistoric horrors written by Adam Nevill, the author of 'The Ritual', 'Last Days', 'No One Gets Out Alive' and the three times winner of The August Derleth Award for Best Horror Novel.</description>

  <description>Jason Arnopp - author of acclaimed cult hit The Last Days of Jack Sparks - returns with a razor-sharp thriller for a social-media obsessed world. Prepare to never look at your phone the same way again . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Collins has been ghosted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was supposed to be moving in with her new boyfriend Scott, but all she finds after relocating to Brighton is an empty apartment. Scott has vanished. His possessions have all disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for his mobile phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate knows she shouldn't hack into Scott's phone. She shouldn't look at his Tinder, his calls, his social media. But she can't quite help herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when the trouble starts. Strange, whispering phone calls from numbers she doesn't recognise. Scratch marks on the walls that she can't explain. And the growing feeling that she's being watched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate refuses to leave the apartment - she's not going anywhere until she's discovered what happened to Scott. But the deeper she dives into Scott's digital history the more Kate realises just how little she really knows about the man she loves.</description>

  <description>Doomsday is here and the earth is suffering with each breath she takes. Whether it’s from the nuclear meltdown, the wrath of the Four Horsemen, a war with technology, or a consequence of our relationship with the planet, humanity is left buried and hiding, our bones exposed, our hearts beating somewhere in our freshly slit throats. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a collection that strips away civilization and throws readers into the lives of its survivors. The poems inside are undelivered letters, tear-soaked whispers, and unanswered prayers. They are every worry you’ve had when your electricity went out, and every pit that grew in your stomach watching the news at night. They are tragedy and trauma, but they are also grief and fear, fear of who—or what—lives inside us once everything is taken away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These pages hold the teeth of monsters against the faded photographs of family and friends, and here, Wytovich is both plague doctor and midwife, both judge and jury, forever searching through severed limbs and exposed wires as she straddles the line evaluating what’s moral versus what’s necessary to survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s clear though, is that the world is burning and we don’t remember who we are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So tell me: who will you become when it’s over?</description>

  <description>At the end of Yellow Street, in a ruined junkyard of a house, an angry outcast hatches a scheme to take revenge for all the wrongs he has suffered. With the help of three alienated neighborhood kids, he plans to hide razor blades, poison, drugs, and broken glass in Halloween candy and use the deadly treats to maim or kill dozens of innocent children. But as the clock ticks closer to sundown, will one of his helpers—an innocent himself, in his own streetwise way—carry out or defeat the plan?</description>

  <description>“For many kids, this will encourage important conversations about identity and sexuality, as well as offer those who might be questioning their own identities the space to see themselves.” – Booklist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The perfect way to teach your kiddos LGBTQ+ vocab while celebrating the beauty of embracing yourself and others.” – KIWI Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The GayBCs made me cry because this is the now for the next queer generation.” – Fangirlish &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A joyful celebration of LGBTQ+ vocabulary for kids of all ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A playdate extravaganza transforms into a celebration of friendship, love, and identity as four friends sashay out of all the closets, dress up in a wardrobe fit for kings and queens, and discover the wonder of imagination. From A is for Ally to F is for Family to Q is for Queer, debut author/illustrator M. L. Webb’s bright illustrations and lively, inclusive poems delight in the beauty of embracing one’s truest self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A glossary in the back offers opportunity for further discussion of terms and identities. The GayBCs is perfect for fans of A Is for Activist and Feminist Baby—showing kids and adults alike that every identity is worthy of being celebrated.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;Midnight strikes like an invocation, clock hands joining in prayer to the darkness. After the twelfth chime, there’s no escaping the nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  &lt;strong&gt;Fear reigns supreme.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Darkness, Delight&lt;/em&gt; is an original anthology series revealing the many facets of modern horror—shocking and quiet, pulp and literary, cold-hearted and heart-felt, weird tales of spiraling madness alongside full-throttle thrillers. Open these pages and unleash all-new terrors that consume from without and within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Midnight is here. It’s now time to find . . . &lt;em&gt;In Darkness, Delight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Or rather, the cannibal out in the woods will bring the danger to them…</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's apocalyptic novel, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, continues in &lt;i&gt;Book Three: Air &amp;amp; Dust&lt;/i&gt; as Adam and Jelnik make their way to a prophetic meeting and a mysterious darkness is creeping inward from the horizon, further threatening the lives of all who remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the devastation of his Georgia church, a Baptist minister comforts an orphaned girl suffering from amnesia. All she knows is her name. Together they confront the darkest of fears as they make their way to a gathering point for the remnants of society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a disastrous night of attacks at an abandoned airfield, a group of survivors plans its exodus. But their hopes are dashed when an autocratic leader arrives to seize control. Fears are one thing, but could this man represent something far worse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive.</description>

  <description>This is a collection of poems and illustrations by Christian DeWild. These poems touch on the funny side of the macabre from Morbid Lester and his little dead bugs, a series of unfortunate events for a rather clumsy vampire, a wrong way witch to more personal poems about self realization like Sorrowful Jane and Me and You a Bit Eskew. There is a little bit of everything in this collection of poems, limericks and very detailed drawings.</description>

  <description>THIS IS AN INVITATION TO DROWNING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the stories of things out of water—of sea bed deserts choked with ghosts; of the lonely, roving children of the fen. Here your garden grows belowground. You will be born into a cradle of your own bones, shadows will burst from your eyes, and your mouth will fill with thorns. Storms will twist inside you, and the ghosts of your past will follow you and chart your future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, things are out of place—ectopic and unviable—and you will mourn the unborn, those underwater things out of water.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A supernatural thriller in the vein of A Head Full of Ghosts about two young girls, a scary story that becomes far too real, and the tragic--and terrifying--consequences that follow one of them into adulthood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red Lady, Red Lady, show us your face...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1991, Heather Cole and her friends were members of the Dead Girls Club. Obsessed with the macabre, the girls exchanged stories about serial killers and imaginary monsters, like the Red Lady, the spirit of a vengeful witch killed centuries before. Heather knew the stories were just that, until her best friend Becca began insisting the Red Lady was real--and she could prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That belief got Becca killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been nearly thirty years, but Heather has never told anyone what really happened that night--that Becca was right and the Red Lady was real. She's done her best to put that fateful summer, Becca, and the Red Lady, behind her. Until a familiar necklace arrives in the mail, a necklace Heather hasn't seen since the night Becca died. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night Heather killed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, someone else knows what she did...and they're determined to make Heather pay.</description>

  <description>Some campfire stories are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been twenty-five years since Cyrus Hoyt’s infamous killing spree at Camp Forest Grove. A quarter-century since teenage counsellor Melanie Holden left him mortally wounded and escaped with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Melanie’s teaching career has bottomed out and left her with no choice but to return to the scene of the crime. Motivated by a lucrative publishing offer, as well as a desire to free herself from recurring nightmares, Melanie’s research into the murderer’s life brings resistance from all directions as she uncovers skeletons in Forest Grove’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of Melanie, a long-held secret is about to be revealed—one that somebody is willing to kill for in order to protect. And Melanie is going to discover she has a lot more to lose than just her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stalk-and-slash suspense of &lt;i&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/i&gt; meets the small town mystery of &lt;i&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/i&gt; in this white-knuckle horror story of a final girl’s revenge.</description>

  <description>What does carrion taste like? Andi has to know. The vultures circling outside her home taunt and invite her to come understand the secrets hiding in their banquet of decay. Fascination morphs into an obsessive need to know what the vultures know. Andi turns to Dr. Fawning, but even the therapist cannot help her comprehend the secrets she’s buried beneath anger-induced blackouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her girlfriend, Luna, tries to help Andi battle her inner darkness and infatuation with the vultures. However, the desire to taste dead flesh, to stitch together wings of her own and become one with the flock sends Andi down a twisted, unforgivable path. Once she understands the secrets the vultures conceal, she must decide between abandoning the birds of prey or risk turning her loved ones into nothing more than meals to be devoured.</description>

  <description>Sometimes, survival is a sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amity Collins, a 20-year-old deaf woman, and her gay brother Caleb, have lived a sheltered life since the death of their father thirteen years ago, a day of gunshots and wild dogs. Now the time has come to escape their mother’s hoarded home in Australia, and a history of trauma they haven’t been able to reconcile—until now. Their adventure abroad isn’t just wanted. It’s essential. With flights booked, they leave their claustrophobic town behind, nervous yet hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Collins siblings backpack through the jungles of Thailand, drink and dance in Bangkok, accumulating friends. There is laughter, budding love, delicious risk. Amity has never felt more awed. Or alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes when they purchase boat tickets to a tourist trap the locals call Bastard Island. ‘Discover paradise,’ the advertisement reads. ‘Come and feed the monkeys!’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there on that remote beach, surrounded by people Amity doesn’t know or trust, the trees twitch as though impatient or hungry. From within those shadows, savagery is about to be unleashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tide of teeth is near. Those sands will run red. And on Bastard Island, even survival is a sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Place for Sinners&lt;/i&gt; is a surreal, ultra-violent odyssey into the absolute heart of darkness in us all. It will snatch you by the throat, blindside you with its twists, and leave you too broken to ever travel again.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Jay Harris lives in a world struck down by a deadly virus. His parents are dead, along with half the planet. When Jay’s sister Maia falls ill, he must find a cure before he loses her, too. But unbeknownst to Maia, Jay is also sick… and he’s running out of time to save them both.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jay’s friends tell him there might be a cure for him in France, he must decide whether to pursue it. The journey will be difficult and dangerous, especially in his weakened state, but with little time left—for himself and for Maia—it soon becomes clear there’s no other choice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jay leaves the relative comfort of London to search for help, knowing he may never find it. Along the way, he experiences the effects of disaster on the bonds of friendship and fluctuating notions of family. These teens, decimated by a dangerous plague, face stark choices in their search for help, not knowing if their efforts will end in loss and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Jay and Maia find a cure before the virus takes them?</description>

  <description>Five years after Ashley King survived the infamous Resort Massacre, she’s found hanging in her basement by her fiancé, Todd Matthews. She left behind clues as to what really happened that night, clues that may reveal the identity of the killer the press has called The Wraith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of his friends, Todd goes back to the crumbling Hayden Resort, a death-tinged ruin in the Catskills Mountains. What they find is a haunted history that’s been lying in wait for a fresh set of victims. The Wraith is back, and he’s nothing what they expected.</description>

  <description>The Easton family has just moved into their new fixer-upper, a beautiful old house that they bought at a steal, and Alice, the youngest of the family, is excited to explore the strange, new place. Her excitement turns to growing dread as she discovers a picture hidden under the old wallpaper, a child’s drawing of a family just like hers. Soon after, members of the family begin to disappear, each victim marked on the child’s drawing with a dark black X. It’s up to her to unlock the grim mystery of the house before she becomes the next victim.</description>

  <description>Some things are older than time. Older than darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levi is a monstrous man—made of scars and scary as hell, he’s glutted on ghosts and evolving to carry out the dark wishes of the ancient whispers in his head. He’s building a door and what’s on the other side is terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jones spent a lot of time living bottle to bottle and trying to erase things. Now he’s looking for the man who killed his mother and maybe a little bit of looking or himself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keaton is on the run from accusations as well as himself, he suffers alone until he meets Jubal, an orphaned boy with his little sisters in a sling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every line is not a straight line and everything must converge. A parable writ in dust and blood on warped barn wood. A journey in the classic sense, populated with dried husks of towns… and people both odd and anything but ordinary. Hornets, reverse-werewolves and one of the most vicious villains you’ll ever know are all part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull on your boots and saddle up, we’ll &lt;i&gt;Walk The Darkness Down&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Every year, on her birthday, Laura gets a letter from a stranger. That stranger claims to know the whereabouts of her missing friend Bobby, but there’s a catch: he’ll only tell her what he knows in exchange for something...personal.So begins Laura’s sordid relationship with her new penpal, built on a foundation of quid pro quo. Her quest for closure will push her to bizarre acts of humiliation and harm, yet no matter how hard she tries, she cannot escape her correspondent’s demands. The letters keep coming, and as time passes, they have a profound effect on Laura.From the author of Cruel Works of Nature comes a dark and twisted tale about obsession, guilt, and how far a person will go to put her ghosts to bed.</description>

  <description>Dallas is a man seasoned by both time and circumstance-a fellow you hire to get certain things done. The kind of man you definitely don't want to cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kid is his protege-his younger shadow with more quirks than Dewey's System has decimals. He's loyal as a hound and just as likely to bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being hired for a seemingly easy job, Dallas and the Kid find themselves on a wild ride. Every stop they make introduces lies, violence and memories best left buried. When the control Dallas holds so near and dear starts to squirm free, things get ugly. The routine becomes anything but, and revenge is a bloody dish best served with a .45 pistol.</description>

  <description>Who better to repel a body-snatching alien invasion than a group of teenage horror nerds? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Billy and Tom are best friends, but each knows that at the end of the school year they'll be moving in different directions. But why not go out with a bang and throw one last video night? They can invite some girls over, order a pizza, then maybe try and fight the alien infection that's taken hold over their suburban town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Night of the Creeps&lt;/i&gt; in this slime-drenched '80s horror romp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Hit that first chapter. It’ll hook you, and the next time you look up, you’ll have swallowed the book. It’ll be nesting inside you like a seed, like an egg, like an invasion." -Stephen Graham Jones, author of &lt;i&gt;Mongrels&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The momentum keeps building. The stakes keep escalating. The monsters just keep getting worse and worse, the catastrophic mayhem more juicy and hopeless. Best of all, the writing moves like a greased torpedo, compulsively readable as it rockets through your brain." -&lt;i&gt;Fangoria&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"If you put together the gore, action, monsters, and sense of excitement that made '80s horror movies so great, you'll only have about half of what makes Video Night a must-read tome for horror fans." -&lt;i&gt;Horrortalk&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the spirit of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror and The Outer Limits comes Weeping Season by Seán O’Connor —A unsettling, suspenseful chiller that leaves you gasping for breath...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A group of strangers wake up in a cold isolated forest with no memory of anything before their arrival. Lost, hungry and wandering aimlessly, they are summoned to a campsite by a remote entity who controls their fate through a series of tortuous objectives. Their only hope for survival is either escape from the psychological game reserve, known as Block 18, or face mortality at the hands of its maniacal moderator, who loves nothing more than watch his participants suffer.</description>

  <description>Big, nasty creatures are bubbling up to the surface just as an earthquake gives copycat serial killer Ben Ray Collins the window he needs to escape from prison and continue his life’s work. Destiny seems to have a plan for him as he finds himself at the closed-down campground with a cast of scientists on location looking into the strange disturbances happening at the lake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ben Ray Collins has a vision for a bloody outcome at Camp Still Waters, but never for a second foresees finding himself underground battling enormous, mutated snake-fish, huge crabs, massive spiders and terrifying cryptids. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The award-winning and critically-acclaimed master of horror returns with a pair of chilling tales—both never-before-published in print—that examine the violence and depravity of the human condition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing together his acclaimed novella &lt;em&gt;The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky&lt;/em&gt; and an all-new short novel &lt;em&gt;My Heart Struck Sorrow&lt;/em&gt;, John Hornor Jacobs turns his fertile imagination to the evil that breeds within the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant mix of the psychological and supernatural, blending the acute insight of Roberto Bolaño and the eerie imagination of H. P. Lovecraft, &lt;em&gt;The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky&lt;/em&gt; examines life in a South American dictatorship. Centered on the journal of a poet-in-exile and his failed attempts at translating a maddening text, it is told by a young woman trying to come to grips with a country that nearly devoured itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;My Heart Struck Sorrow&lt;/em&gt;, a librarian discovers a recording from the Deep South—which may be the musical stylings of the Devil himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathtaking and haunting, &lt;em&gt;A Lush and Seething Hell&lt;/em&gt; is a terrifying and exhilarating journey into the darkness, an odyssey into the deepest reaches of ourselves that compels us to confront secrets best left hidden.</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's epic apocalypse of terror, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, continues in &lt;i&gt;Book Two: Water &amp;amp; Wind&lt;/i&gt; when a group of battle-worn seniors pick up the pieces of their ravaged lives and grapple with survival after the end of the world. And for the first time, they begin to notice an ominous pattern in the deluge of fears now roaming the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenagers Kyle, Sarah and Carli sift through the devastation of their lost lives to find anything resembling hope for a future. But when Carli goes missing, the stakes get higher as the search for her takes a diabolical turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the enigmatic Adam retains his tight-fisted grip on his submissive minion Jelnik as a series of unspeakable horrors follow in their wake as the two men travel west toward their dark destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this masterful collection of short fiction, Joe Hill dissects timeless human struggles in thirteen relentless tales of supernatural suspense, including “In The Tall Grass,” one of two stories co-written with Stephen King, basis for the terrifying feature film from Netflix.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little door that opens to a world of fairy tale wonders becomes the blood-drenched stomping ground for a gang of hunters in “Faun.” A grief-stricken librarian climbs behind the wheel of an antique Bookmobile to deliver fresh reads to the dead in “Late Returns.” In “By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain,” two young friends stumble on the corpse of a plesiosaur at the water’s edge, a discovery that forces them to confront the inescapable truth of their own mortality . . . and other horrors that lurk in the water’s shivery depths. And tension shimmers in the sweltering heat of the Nevada desert as a faceless trucker finds himself caught in a sinister dance with a tribe of motorcycle outlaws in “Throttle,” co-written with Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring two previously unpublished stories, and a brace of shocking chillers, &lt;em&gt;Full Throttle&lt;/em&gt; is a darkly imagined odyssey through the complexities of the human psyche. Hypnotic and disquieting, it mines our tormented secrets, hidden vulnerabilities, and basest fears, and demonstrates this exceptional talent at his very best.</description>

  <description>1983: A boy and his little brother wander through a loosely stitched summer. A summer full of sun and surrealism, Lessons of loss and love. Of growing up and figuring it out. Nestled in the mountains of Pennsylvania is a small town, it's not like the others. Things are strange there- people die but hang around, pets too. Everyone knows your name and sometimes, a thing as simple as a movie coming to the local theatre, is all it takes to keep you going.</description>

  <description>Choking Back the Devil by Donna Lynch is an invocation, an ancient invitation that summons the darkness within and channels those lonely spirits looking for a host. It's a collection that lives in the realm of ghosts and family curses, witchcraft and urban legends, and if you're brave enough to peek behind the veil, the hauntings that permeate these pages will break seals and open doorways, cut throats and shatter mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, these poems are small drownings, all those subtle suffocations that live in that place between our ribs that swells with panic, incubates fear. Lynch shows her readers that sometimes our shadow selves--our secrets--are our sharpest weapons, the knives that rip through flesh, suture pacts with demons, cut deals with entities looking for more than a homecoming, something better, more intimate than family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's about the masks we wear and the reflections we choose not to look at, and what's most terrifying about the spells is these incantations show that we are the possessed, that we are our greatest monster, and if we look out of the corner of our eyes, sometimes--if we've damned ourselves enough--we can catch a glimpse of our own burnings, what monstrosities and mockeries we're to become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So cross yourselves and say your prayers. Because in this world, you are the witch and the hunter, the girl and the wolf.</description>

      <![CDATA[Horror poetry is a recent discovery for me. I didn't know I needed it until I tried it and now I can't live without it. All of the many voices I have listened to so far are identifiably individualistic. I think that if someone were to give me a blind taste test--I could sample a poem with only my...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Weird fiction wouldn't exist without the women who created it. Meet the female authors who defied convention to craft some of literature's strangest tales. And find out why their own stories are equally intriguing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows about Mary Shelley, creator of &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;; but have you heard of Margaret Cavendish, who wrote a science-fiction epic 150 years earlier? Have you read the psychological hauntings of Violet Paget, who was openly involved in long-term romantic relationships with women in the Victorian era? Or the stories of Gertrude Barrows Bennett, whose writing influenced H.P. Lovecraft? &lt;i&gt;Monster, She Wrote&lt;/i&gt; shares the stories of women past and present who invented horror, speculative, and weird fiction and made it great. You'll meet celebrated icons (Ann Radcliffe, V.C. Andrews), forgotten wordsmiths (Eli Coltor, Ruby Jean Jensen), and today's vanguard (Helen Oyeyemi). And each profile includes a curated reading list so you can seek out the spine-chilling tales that interest you the most.</description>

  <description>Something evil has swept into the small western Maine town of Castle Rock on the heels of the latest winter storm. Sheriff Norris Ridgewick and his team are desperately searching for two missing girls, but time is running out to bring them home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Washington D.C., thirty-seven-year-old Gwendy Peterson couldn't be more different from the self-conscious teenaged girl who once spent a summer running up Castle Rock's Suicide Stairs. That same summer, she was entrusted - or some might say cursed - with the extraordinary button box by Richard Farris, the mysterious stranger in the black suit. The seductive and powerful box offered Gwendy small gifts in exchange for its care and feeding until Farris eventually returned, promising Gwendy she'd never see the box again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, though, the button box shows up without warning - and without Richard Farris to explain why, or what she's supposed to do with it. The mysterious reappearance of the box, along with the troubling disappearances in Castle Rock, leads Gwendy home again... where she just might be able to help rescue the missing girls and stop a madman before he does something ghastly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestseller Richard Chizmar comes &lt;i&gt;Gwendy's Magic Feather&lt;/i&gt;, a breathtaking novel that asks whether our lives are controlled by fate or the choices we make - and what price we might have to pay for those choices when we reach for the things we most desire. Prepare to return again to Stephen King's Castle Rock, the sleepy little town built on a bedrock of deep, dark secrets, which is about to awaken from its quiet slumber once more.</description>

      <![CDATA[Short story collections are my favorite way to get to know a new author. I find that there is always a variety of genres and styles represented, not unlike an artist's portfolio or listening to song samples from an album.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the lineage of Peter Straub's &lt;i&gt;Julia&lt;/i&gt;, Scott Thomas’ &lt;i&gt;Violet&lt;/i&gt; is the disturbing tale of a woman haunted by her long-abandoned imaginary friend.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many children, the summer of 1988 was filled with sunshine and laughter. But for ten-year-old Kris Barlow, it was her chance to say goodbye to her dying mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, loss returns—her husband killed in a car accident. And so, Kris goes home to the place where she first knew pain—to that summer house overlooking the crystal waters of Lost Lake. It’s there that Kris and her eight-year-old daughter will make a stand against grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a shadow has fallen over the quiet lake town of Pacington, Kansas. Beneath its surface, an evil has grown—and inside that home where Kris Barlow last saw her mother, an old friend awaits her return.</description>

  <description>Selburn, Virginia: A quiet backwater town nestled among the Blue Ridge Mountains. In the days before the Civil War, Sam Lock keeps the peace as the town sheriff, like his father before him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That peace is shattered during a raging winter storm when a boy goes missing at Evermore, the sprawling estate of Horace Crownhill and his family. Racing against time and the elements, Sam must mount a desperate search for the child—but what he finds in the snow, and the dark halls of Evermore, are madness ... and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sam searches for truth in a house poisoned by mysteries and haunted by ghosts, he hopes to weather the storm, but the harrowing secrets he uncovers may prove too terrible to bear. Will he escape with his sanity intact or will the dark presence rumored to hold sway over Evermore claim him as another sacrifice?</description>

  <description>Strang isn’t the small, quaint town it appears to be. It’s haunted every night by a creature the townsfolk refer to as Halloween. Once the sun sets each day, Halloween emerges to collect its treats: a small, live offering from each household. The residents comply because no one wants to be the target of Halloween’s tricks. But the nightmare of residing in Strang is nothing compared to the yearly ritual Halloween demands of the citizens on All Hallows’ Eve.</description>

  <description>All myths have a kernel of truth. The truth is: vampires are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ve always been here, but only came out of hiding in the last century. They are not what Hollywood would have you believe. They are not what is written in lore or whispered by the superstitious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look and act like humans. They live and love and die like humans. Puberty is just a bit more stressful for those with the recessive gene. And while some teenagers worry about high school, others dread their next set of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampires are real, but in a social climate still struggling to accept that truth, do teeth alone make them monsters?</description>

  <description>Felix Allsey is a travel writer with a keen eye for the paranormal, and he's carved out a unique, if only slightly lucrative, niche for himself in nonfiction; he writes travelogues of the country's most haunted places, after haunting them himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he convinces the owner of the infamous Rotterdam Mansion to let him stay on the premises for 13 nights, he believes he's finally found the location that will bring him a bestseller. As with his other gigs, he sets rules for himself: no leaving the house for any reason, refrain from outside contact, and sleep during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Thomas Ruth, Felix's oldest friend and fellow horror film obsessive, joins him on the project, the two dance around a recent and unspeakably painful rough-patch in their friendship, but eventually fall into their old rhythms of dark humor and movie trivia. That's when things start going wrong: screams from upstairs, figures in the thresholds, and more than what should be in any basement. Felix realizes the book he's writing, and his very state of mind, is tilting from nonfiction into all out horror, and the shocking climax answers a question that's been staring these men in the face all along: In Rotter House, who's haunting who?</description>

  <description>The city of Elendhaven sulks on the edge of the ocean. Wracked by plague, abandoned by the South, stripped of industry and left to die. But not everything dies so easily. A thing without a name stalks the city, a thing shaped like a man, with a dark heart and long pale fingers yearning to wrap around throats. A monster who cannot die. His frail master sends him out on errands, twisting him with magic, crafting a plan too cruel to name, while the monster’s heart grows fonder and colder and more cunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These monsters of Elendhaven will have their revenge on everyone who wronged the city, even if they have to burn the world to do it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Intense, imaginative, and empathic. Matthews is a damn good writer, and make no mistake, he &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; hurt you." ~Jack Ketchum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten year old Lilly is the victim of a terrible house fire and a wretched family. Her father is an addict with mental illness, her mother was murdered and then buried across the street, and her uncle got her addicted to heroin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilly’s tragic story has been told in the book ALL SMOKE RISES, and it may be true, for the author has broken into your house, and placed Lilly's body on your kitchen counter. He demands you read the manuscript, before cutting his own wrists and bleeding out on your floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you have decisions to make, for Lilly's body may not be dead, and her family is coming for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;MORE PRAISE FOR ALL SMOKE RISES&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Make no mistake, when it comes to citations of true horror, you will be hard pressed to find a deeper and more challenging example than you will here. Matthews knows the heartbreak and tragedy of his subject. By the time you are done reading this, you will too." ~KEALAN PATRICK BURKE, Bram Stoker Award winning author of KIN and Sour Candy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Absolutely stunning." ~JULIE HUTCHINGS, author of Running Home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Heartbreakingly sad, overwhelmingly disturbing, creepy, violent and poignant. Highly recommended." ~JOHN FD TAFF Bram Stoker Finalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Filled with such dread and depravity that even the most desensitized among us will feel the pain. Matthews's prose vividly shows the viciousness and hopelessness of drug addiction, and the beautifully horrifying images will stay with you long after the final page is digested." ~JON BASSOFF, author of Corrosion, winner of the Darkfuse Reader's Choice Award&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"True reality horror, with supernatural elements that only serve to make it more believable." ~MICHAEL BRADFORD, Executive Producer, Monkey Knuckle Films.</description>

  <description>For nearly a century Castle Blackwood lay dormant on the Sorrows, a lonely island in the Pacific. Last summer, the evil that resided within its walls was awakened. Movie music composer Ben Shadeland was lucky to escape the island with his wife and young son, but he'll soon realize that the terror is far from over. Because a godlike beast named Gabriel and the ghosts who live on the Sorrows are hungry for revenge. They will stop at nothing to bring Ben back to Castle Blackwood, and they will strike at those closest to him to fulfill their sinister plans. Accompanied by three federal officers, an L.A. detective, the newly-widowed owner of the island, a professor specializing in the occult, and a voluptuous psychic, Ben must return to the Sorrows in order to save someone he loves. Ben thought he knew what true horror was. But the new visitors have brought with them their own personal ghosts. And the beast of Castle Blackwood won't be sated until it has feasted on the blood of Ben Shadeland and everyone dear to him. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>From Claire C. Holland, a timely collection of poetry that follows the final girl of slasher cinema - the girl who survives until the end - on a journey of retribution and reclamation. From the white picket fences of 1970s Haddonfield to the apocalyptic end of the world, Holland confronts the role of women in relation to subjects including feminism, violence, motherhood, sexuality, and assault in the world of Trump and the MeToo movement. Each poem centers on a fictional character from horror cinema, and explores the many ways in which women find empowerment through their own perceived monstrousness.</description>

  <description>Grief is a black house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far would you go? What horrors would you endure if it meant you might see the son you thought you'd lost forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven to a breakdown by the brutal murder of her young son, Lucy Campbell had locked herself away, fallen deep inside herself, become a ghost haunting room 23b of the William Tuke Psychiatric Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There she'd remained, until the whispering pulled her back, until she found herself once more sitting in her car, calling to the son she had lost, staring into the black panes of the now abandoned house where Alex had died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, someone is watching her back.</description>

  <description>These are his final moments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the little city of Wood River, Illinois, a man nicknamed Firecracker knows the end is near. The fire is coming, just like it came for his father, his grandfather, and who knows how many men. After all, folks in those parts have a short-term memory when it comes to history, and lots of stories have a tendency to go to the grave. Maybe the fire was always there. Maybe it came along when the oil refinery went up in 1907. Who can say? Sometimes, a yarn like this is as close to a history book as a Midwest community and its people are apt to get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When it happened to his father, the doctors only called it an accident. But Firecracker's mother had a name for it: spontaneous combustion. Firecracker knows there is no way to escape this Act of God, so he retreats into his memories. Past and present become one and the same. The veil of reality pulls away and Death arrives in time for one last conversation, where Firecracker comes to terms with the mysteries of his own life, and realizes that some questions are not nearly as important as the moments which spawned them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the first line of the tale that sees his eyes explode to--moments and pages later--his whole body being consumed by flame, Firecracker experiences his life and loves through a succession of memories, reveals his friendship with Death, and talks about the men in his family's unfortunate predisposition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a yarn about life and death and spontaneous human combustion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a tale of a man with a fire inside him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the End of the Day I Burst into Flames is a horror story about how beautiful love can be.</description>

  <description>At the outskirts of Maple City sits the Crossroads Motel, a throwback to the days when the motor lodge was king. Two years ago, the motel was the site of an act so brutal that its buildings were left to rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie Voss, however, sees promise in the Crossroad's bare bones and buys it up, determined to breathe new life into the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Larson family shows up on her doorstep, road-weary and desperate for a break, Jessie offers them lodging, even though her grand opening is still a week away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the arrival of guests awakens the motel, and Jessie soon finds herself host to both the living and the dead.</description>

  <description>This debut collection of poetry from Sara Tantlinger takes a dark look at all the horrors of love, the pleasures of flesh, and the lust for blood. For discerning fans of romance and the macabre, look no further than Love For Slaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Sara Tantlinger has just sent a Valentine's present to your funeral. Seduction is a slaughterhouse in "Love for Slaughter" -- the first poetry book from this brilliantly evocative and subversively disturbing new horror writer -- a woman dead set on beheading Cupid and reminding us all how weird love really is. From the charm of the corpse to the beauty of butchery, Tantlinger's poems roil with dangerous desire and are relentlessly provocative -- satanically sultry stuff that you won't be able to stop reading."&lt;br /&gt;-Michael Arnzen, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Proverbs for Monsters and The Gorelets Omnibus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sara Tantlinger’s Love for Slaughter is full of dark moments of exquisite beauty. She is particularly adept at making even the bleakest of sentiments sound sensual and captivating. Full of clever wordplay, haunting rhythms, and excellent phrasing, Tantlinger’s work is a must for readers who like their poetry with a side of sexy gloom.” &lt;br /&gt;-K.W. Taylor, author of The Curiosity Killers</description>

  <description>The house on Old Mill Road has stood in an open field for longer than Jesse Wells has been alive, its crooked windows and jutting turret tormenting the kids of Warsaw, Michigan the way only a haunted house knows how. Everyone imagines that something terrible lurks within the house's abandoned rooms -- especially Jesse and his two closest friends, Casey and Reed. But when Reed chooses the house as a backdrop for his own suicide, childhood ghost stories are transformed into a nightmare that sends Jesse into a downward spiral of grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly twenty years later, Jesse stands on the collapsing steps of the house that snatched away his best friend. Casey has asked him to revisit their old demons, if only to help them find closure that's long overdue. But tragedy finds them once more, and Jesse is left forever changed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, left to cope with the disaster that had become his life, Jesse must unravel the mystery behind the house that has terrified him since he was a boy. To fail is to lose everything he has left. But success might come at an even a higher price.</description>

  <description>They came to the lush, deserted island to compete on a popular reality TV show. Each one hoped to be the last to leave. Now they're just hoping to stay alive. It seems the island isn't deserted after all. Contestants and crew members are disappearing, but they aren't being eliminated by the game. They're being taken by the monstrous half-human creatures that live in the jungle. The men will be slaughtered. The women will be kept alive as captives. Night is falling, the creatures are coming, and rescue is so far away. . .</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's highly-anticipated epic supernatural thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, begins with &lt;i&gt;Book One: Fire &amp;amp; Rain&lt;/i&gt; where humanity faces a series of catastrophes spawned by a worldwide event that unleashes all of mankind's greatest fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the American high desert, vacationers returning from a road trip are thrust into a heart-stopping flight from death as they try to avoid a cataclysmic end. In rural Missouri, the lives of a group of high school students are destroyed after their small town is devastated and they're forced to confront the end of everything they've ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on the eastern seaboard, there's someone else. An enigmatic man who thrives on despair and embraces all fear. A man with his own dark and sinister goals. Someone who wants to ensure humanity goes out with the biggest bang possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.

  <description>Rebecca Daniels is a down-and-out private investigator on the hunt for her daughter’s killer. The trail leads to Bright Fork, a sleepy New Hampshire town where Rebecca discovers this is no ordinary manhunt. Her investigation becomes a tangle of brutal killings, secret rituals, and terrifying visions that force Rebecca to question reality. This is more than an opportunity to take revenge on the one who tore her family to pieces. It’s a chance to confront the darkness growing inside of her, the madness that threatens to possess her entirely.</description>

  <description>A group of young boys steal a death mask from an antique store and face violent retribution. Inept criminals who dream of a big payday plot to kidnap a child. Four video store clerks venture into a freak Los Angeles snowstorm and discover that not all monsters are special effects. Two sisters convince themselves there’s no reason to be afraid of Aunt Alice and her secrets, now that she’s dead. An amnesiac suspects that the man who claims to love her may in fact be keeping her a prisoner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From riverside towns in the Midwest and a future Paris above the clouds, to ancient lycanthropes and vindictive pachyderms, this collection of supernatural terrors and heartbreaking reality from award-nominated Nicholas Day, author of Now That We’re Alone and At the End of the Day I Burst into Flames, explores identity, addiction, love, and death. Plunge headfirst into fifteen tales of monsters, madness, and all the darkness human hearts can carry. Danger lurks around every corner, every decision a step closer to demise. Everybody gets what’s coming to them in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, of course, Nobody Gets Hurt.</description>

  <description>In 1984 the Books of Blood by Clive Barker were published and quickly gained a following worldwide. Literary eminences like Stephen King noticed early on the creativity and powerful prose throughout the Books of Blood, bringing Clive Barker's stories to the forefront of horror fiction. One of these stories was "The Midnight Meat Train" following one Leon Kaufman as he discovers the origins of a series of grizzly subway train murders in New York City... and the controlling forces behind it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clive Barker's The Midnight Meat Train Special Definitive Edition brings the original story back with all-new material: a new afterword written by Clive Barker, seven color paintings based on the story by the author, a new introduction by Phil &amp;amp; Sarah Stokes, a foreword by the movie screenplay writer Jeff Buhler, storyboards from the film, never-before-seen photos, notes, sketches and more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please note that because the official movie script was in image format we had to remove it from this ebook edition. Many materials from the major motion picture are still in this edition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"What Barker does in THE BOOKS OF BLOOD makes the rest of us look like we've been asleep for the last ten years. . . He's an original." &lt;b&gt;- Stephen King&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Clive Barker assaults our senses and our psyche, seeking not so much to tingle our spine as to snap it altogether." &lt;b&gt;- Los Angeles Times&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Mixing elements of horror, science fiction and surrealist literature, Barker's work reads like a cross between Stephen King and South American novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He creates a world where our biggest fears appear to be our own dreams." &lt;b&gt;- Boston Herald&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Barker's eye is unblinking; he drags out our terrors from the shadows and forces us to look upon them and despair or laugh with relief." &lt;b&gt;- The Washington Post&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Mike Roberts kicks over a homeless woman's cup of change, she whispers a cryptic warning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Mind the cracks . . ."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Boston he knows and loves is unraveling around him. But his life is not the only thing at stake. His mother, a once acclaimed writer lost in the late stages of Alzheimer's, depends on him to have a home. And then there's her caretaker, Cassie, who might want something more from Mike than the friendship they've long shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his city balances on a razor's edge, Mike will have to hunt down the daughter of the woman he wronged and uncover their terrible family secret . . . or be plunged into a world of crawling horrors and unspeakable hunger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world from which no one has ever returned.</description>

  <description>Once an exciting up-and-coming star of the burgeoning paranormal investigation TV genre, now Prudence Osgood finds herself as a barely functioning alcoholic living in daily pain, both physical, from a car accident nearly twenty years ago, and emotional, from the loss of Audrey Frost, her partner and best friend, over an ill-advised hoax. When a random and cryptic email shows up in her inbox, she must begin an investigation that is far more sinister than it initially seems, and far more connected to the last two decades of her own life than she could ever imagine.​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osgood As Gone cuts a trail from a lonely rest stop papered in missing posters, to a notebook full of symbols and sigils, to a band that could outsell The Beatles that vanished almost overnight. Can our intrepid hero Osgood follow the breadcrumbs, avoid texts from her one-night-stand Nora, make amends for the past, and still have a future? Find out in Osgood As Gone.</description>

  <description>Throughout history, there have been certain moral evils so entangling, so alluring, that they routinely give birth to countless other evils in the hearts of human beings. From antiquity, these "capital vices" have been known as the seven deadly sins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, from the editors who brought you Cutting Block Single Slices and Shadows Over Main Street, comes an all-new novella anthology featuring seven dark fiction authors at the top of their games, each writing passionately about one of The Seven Deadliest sins. Inside these pages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John C. Foster spins "Gilda," a yarn about Avarice;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracken MacLeod takes us on the road to Wrath with "A Short Madness";&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kasey Lansdale's "Cap Diamant" teaches us the steep cost of Pride;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian Kirk lays bare the Jealousy hidden beneath affluence in "Chisel and Stone";&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rena Mason reveals a new and terrifying guise of Sloth in "Clevengers of the Carrion Sea";&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Thomas examines Lust in his dystopian "Ring of Fire"; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John F.D. Taff feeds us the darker aspects of Gluttony in "All You Care to Eat."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dark tales from a cabal of highly regarded and award-winning authors hold nothing back, so turn the pages and feast your eyes. The Seven Deadliest sins await you.</description>

  <description>A group of desperate student filmmakers break into Crawford Manor for an unauthorised night shoot. They have no choice. Their lead actress has quit. They’re out of time. They’re out of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Crawford Manor has a past that won’t stay dead, and the crew are about to come face-to-face with the hideous secret that stalks the halls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will anyone survive…the NIGHT SHOOT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delirious homage to the slasher movies of the 1980s, Night Shoot delivers page after page of white-knuckle terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Night Shoot is wildly entertaining. If you’re not laughing, you’re scared out of your mind. A final girl story people will be talking about for a long time.”&lt;br /&gt;Sadie Hartmann, Mother Horror</description>

  <description>Welcome to historic Lea Bay, home of maritime lore and the region’s most popular pirate festival. It was also the landing site of the infamous Lords of the Deep, ruthless pirates who once pillaged the area and said to have hidden a chest full of cursed treasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this year’s pirate festival will be different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This year, the Lords of the Deep are coming home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recovering from the death of her husband, Daphne Jordan is thrust into a series of bizarre events leading up to the big celebration. Lea Bay locals have been reporting strange incidents. Green mist. Seismic activity. Sinister sightings in the harbor, things with scales and long, sharp teeth. Monsters. Joined by her brother-in-law and a local police officer, Daphne must solve the mystery before whatever is swimming beneath the shore surfaces for all eternity. Before the Lords of the Deep resurrect their long-dormant leader upon the Bay—and the world.</description>

  <description>That Which Grows Wild collects sixteen dark and masterful short stories by award-winning author Eric J. Guignard. Equal parts whimsy and weird, horror and heartbreak, this debut collection traverses the darker side of the fantastic through vibrant and harrowing tales that depict monsters and regrets, hope and atonement, and the oddly changing reflection that turns back at you in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover why, after only several years, Eric J. Guignard has developed an ardent following and earned praise by masters of the craft such as Ramsey Campbell (“Guignard gives voice to paranoid vision that’s all too believable.”) and Rick Hautala (“No other young horror author is better, I think, than Eric J. Guignard.”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Table of Contents includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Case Study in Natural Selection and How It Applies to Love&lt;br /&gt;Last Days of the Gunslinger, John Amos&lt;br /&gt;Momma&lt;br /&gt;Footprints Fading in the Desert&lt;br /&gt;The House of the Rising Sun, Forever&lt;br /&gt;The Inveterate Establishment of Daddano &amp;amp; Co.&lt;br /&gt;Last Night...&lt;br /&gt;Those Who Watch From On High&lt;br /&gt;Vancouver Fog&lt;br /&gt;A Curse and a Kiss&lt;br /&gt;Whispers of the Earth&lt;br /&gt;A Serving of Nomu Sashimi&lt;br /&gt;Certain Sights of an Afflicted Woman&lt;br /&gt;A Journey of Great Waves&lt;br /&gt;A Quaint Ol’ Bigfoot Tale&lt;br /&gt;Dreams of a Little Suicide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;###&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I feel privileged to have read THAT WHICH GROWS WILD by Eric J. Guignard. The defining new voice of horror has arrived, and I stand in awe.” —Nancy Holder, NYT bestselling author, WICKED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Eric J. Guignard crafts storytelling into a timeless masterpiece: THAT WHICH GROWS WILD: 16 TALES OF DARK FICTION is a brilliant collection of haunting stories that will captivate readers that relish dark fiction.” —Fanbase Press&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A good story evolves, develops, grows into an adventurous journey that the reader can become absorbed in and think about long after the last page is turned. And that’s just what the book THAT WHICH GROWS WILD: 16 TALES OF DARK FICTION by Bram Stoker Award-winner Eric J. Guignard does for the reader.” —Amazing Stories Magazine</description>

  <description>Where there is darkness, there isn't always light... Dayna Harris thought her problems began in her bedroom. More specifically in her bed, the bed she'd shared with her husband, Richard, for twenty-six years. The bed where she witnessed Richard cheating on her with a woman half his age. But maybe they really began in the motel room that day. What conjured the dark figure Dayna first glimpsed in the motel mirror? The dark figure that continues to haunt her as her marriage to Richard crumbles. Consumed by Richard's infidelity, Dayna begins unravelling his lies revealing a husband she never knew. Now, psychologically imprisoned by a manipulative and dangerous husband, can Dayna find the courage to leave, and can she discover if the very real shadow that torments her is a figment of her imagination or something more sinister? In this edgy paranormal psychological thriller, author J.M. White takes us into the realms of the unknown, lives that are built on lies, forces we can't always explain and the emotional torture of domestic abuse. It shows one woman's search for light in the darkness.</description>

  <description>Nick and the boys return from the summer's last hunting trip to find the streets empty, the beachfront and park abandoned, and the windows of their own homes boarded shut. The hunters have become the hunted, in an apocalyptic plague that pits man against beast—very tiny beasts. And Nick is determined to keep his strength, courage and family alive during what could very well be the last winter of their lives.</description>

  <description>David Botham just wants a quiet ordinary life—his job at the travel agency, his relationship with his girlfriend Stephanie. He doesn’t want to be a writer, and he certainly doesn’t think he’s one. The online blog that uses a title he once thought up has nothing to do with him. He has no idea who is writing it or where they get their information about a series of violent deaths in Liverpool. If they’re murders, how can the killer go unseen even by the security cameras? Perhaps David won’t know until they come too close to him—until he can’t ignore the figure from his past that is catching up with him. Perhaps denying it isn’t just the worst thing he can do but fatal...</description>

  <description>The devastating debut short story collection from British Fantasy Award-winning author Georgina Bruce. Haunting and visceral tales for the lost and the lonely. An emotional and riveting debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance praise for Georgina Bruce's 'This House of Wounds.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An astonishing, totally absorbing debut collection. Edgy, disturbing and delicious in equal parts. Georgina Bruce plays with myth and horror beautifully."-Kerry Hadley-Pryce, Author of Gamble, and The Black Country&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The stories in This House of Wounds strike me as both an emotional and intellectual examination of pain, from how it spreads and is passed on to others to how it can easily turn us into different, crueller creatures. Each act formed in pain leads to another, then another, and this makes for twisted, beautiful reading. Georgina Bruce is a courageous and compelling writer."-Aliya Whiteley, Author of The Loosening Skin, and The Beauty</description>

  <description>When newscaster Abby Waite is diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness, she decides to do the logical thing… break her twin sister Martha out of prison and hit the road. Their destination is the Waite family cabin in Minnesota where Abby plans a family reunion of sorts. But when you come from a family where your grandfather frequently took control of your body during your youth, where your mother tried to inhabit your mind and suck your youthful energies out of you, and where so many dark secrets–and bodies, even–are buried, such a family meeting promises to be nothing short of complicated…</description>

  <description>TWELVE YEARS BEFORE THE EVENTS OF TAMER ANIMALS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monica has suffered from paranoid schizophrenia her entire life. For the most part, she manages her disease well—that is, until her family moves into an old house in the woods, and she starts seeing an imaginary entity from her childhood creeping around the property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW HOME. OLD HAUNTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things quickly become terrifying for Monica as her reality begins to blend with fiction, and something else entirely. . . some indescribable evil out in those woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"ROTTEN LITTLE THINGS takes you to some frightfully dark places." - Jay Sigler, author of TRAIN THOUGHTS</description>

  <description>Elizabeth Lavenza hasn't had a proper meal in weeks. Her thin arms are covered with bruises from her "caregiver," and she is on the verge of being thrown into the streets . . . until she is brought to the home of Victor Frankenstein, an unsmiling, solitary boy who has everything--except a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor is her escape from misery. Elizabeth does everything she can to make herself indispensable--and it works. She is taken in by the Frankenstein family and rewarded with a warm bed, delicious food, and dresses of the finest silk. Soon she and Victor are inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her new life comes at a price. As the years pass, Elizabeth's survival depends on managing Victor's dangerous temper and entertaining his every whim, no matter how depraved. Behind her blue eyes and sweet smile lies the calculating heart of a girl determined to stay alive no matter the cost . . . as the world she knows is consumed by darkness.</description>

  <description>John Langan’s new book is certain to solidify his place among the strongest voices in modern literary horror. Placed together within the same cover for the first time, a theme emerges from the tales that binds and unites them–and it is signaled in the title of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These are stories of betrayal,” author John Langan confirms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this thread, the stories are otherwise quite distinct from each other in terms of their characters, plots, settings, themes and even varieties of horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s “In Paris in the Mount of Kronos,” a snappy, neo-noirish, action packed Laird Barron-esque encounter with ancient malevolent forces; the dark, character-driven relationship dramas of “The Third Always Beside You” and “Renfrew’s Course”; the vaguely Lovecraftian horrors of “Bloom”; the atmospheric steampunk weirdness in the form of “The Unbearable Proximity of Mr. Dunn’s Balloons”; and apocalyptic surrealism in “Bos Uros”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the title novella, Sefira, is about a woman who is chasing a succubus across the United States, while the novelette At Home in the Devil’s House offers a new, nightmarish concept of Hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sefira and Other Betrayals contains stories previously published in such prestigious anthologies as Supernatural Noir, Blood and Other Cravings, Ghosts by Gaslight, Black Wings 2, Shadows Edge and others, and includes one original novella, Sefira, and an original novelette, At Home in the Devil’s House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from Rue Morgue Magazine review)</description>

  <description>Having won his emancipation after fighting on the side of the colonies during the American Revolution, Salem Hawley is a free man. Only a handful of years after the end of British rule, Hawley finds himself drawn into a new war unlike anything he has ever seen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City is on the cusp of a new revolution as the science of medicine advances, but procuring bodies for study is still illegal. Bands of resurrectionists are stealing corpses from New York cemeteries, and women of the night are disappearing from the streets, only to meet grisly ends elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friend’s family is robbed from their graves, Hawley is compelled to fight back against the wave of exhumations plaguing the Black cemetery. Little does he know, the theft of bodies is key to far darker arts being performed by the resurrectionists. If successful, the work of these occultists could spell the end of the fledgling American Experiment… and the world itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Resurrectionists&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in the Salem Hawley series, is a novella of historical cosmic horror from the author of Broken Shells and Mass Hysteria. </description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 horror Stories. One legendary music venue. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the old cliché: Sex, drugs and rock and roll. Now, add demons, other dimensions, monsters, revenge, human sacrifice, and a dash of the truly inexplicable. This is the story of the (fictional) San Francisco music venue, &lt;strong&gt;The Shantyman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Show&lt;/em&gt;, seventeen of today's hottest writers of horror and dark fiction come together in devilish harmony to trace The Shantyman's history from its disturbing birth through its apocalyptic encore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring stories by &lt;strong&gt;Brian Keene, John Skipp, Mary SanGiovanni, Robert Ford, Max Booth III, Glenn Rolfe, Matt Hayward, Bryan Smith, Matt Serafini, Kelli Owen, Jonathan Janz, Patrick Lacey, Adam Cesare, Alan M Clark, Somer Canon, Rachel Autumn Deering and Jeff Strand&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compiled by Matt Hayward. Edited by Doug Murano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your curiosity, but leave your inhibitions at the door. The show is about to begin…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly represented by &lt;strong&gt;Crystal Lake Publishing—Tales from the Darkest Depths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interview with compiler Matt Hayward:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this horror anthology so special?&lt;br /&gt;A: The book is as much an anthology as it is a collaborative novel. Each story explores the history of the Shantyman, a haunted music venue located in San Francisco with a long and bloody past. With the likes of John Skipp, Brian Keene, and Rachel Autumn Deering involved, we not only see the venue change throughout the decades, but also from changing perspectives, everything from psychological horror to extreme horror, and even a splash of comedy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Tell us more about the venue and the history of the building?&lt;br /&gt;The Shantyman's history is the product of author/illustrator Alan M Clark. Alan usually tackles historical horror, and I wouldn't have chosen anyone else to take on the task. What Alan delivered was a seven-thousand-word horror juggernaut set in San Francisco’s gold rush era, involving a traveling singer who gets shanghaied. I won't ruin any surprises, but there are cannibals. Alan sets the gruesome scene from which every other story stems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: What made you think of this theme for the anthology?&lt;br /&gt;A: About a year ago, I attended a comedy show at a famous music venue here in Dublin. The main room was seated, and the audience rather docile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A decadent rock star. A deeply religious radio host. A disgraced scientist. And a teenage girl who may be the world's last hope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shana wakes up one morning to discover her little sister in the grip of a strange malady. She appears to be sleepwalking. She cannot talk and cannot be woken up. And she is heading with inexorable determination to a destination that only she knows. But Shana and her sister are not alone. Soon they are joined by a flock of sleepwalkers from across America, on the same mysterious journey. And like Shana, there are other “shepherds” who follow the flock to protect their friends and family on the long dark road ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For on their journey, they will discover an America convulsed with terror and violence, where this apocalyptic epidemic proves less dangerous than the fear of it. As the rest of society collapses all around them–and an ultraviolent militia threatens to exterminate them–the fate of the sleepwalkers depends on unraveling the mystery behind the epidemic. The terrifying secret will either tear the nation apart–or bring the survivors together to remake a shattered world.</description>

  <description>Fresh from a stretch in prison, Joe Openshaw is living at home with his father and trying to get his life together again. He has let go of old habits, especially the ones that turned him into an addict and helped land him in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a hike along the Lowback Trail, Joe stumbles on one of the town's oldest secrets--buried long ago, if not forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's an unusual but safe enough treasure--a jar of old pennies. What interests Joe isn't the pennies themselves, but the pieces of paper taped to every coin--a child's handwritten wish on each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first few wishes come true, they are simple things. Fun. Harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except as time goes on, Joe realizes they aren't really wishes at all...they're exchanges, and the bill was racking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is free in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooner or later, you always pay.</description>

He wants justice, and he's going to make sure the kids pay for what they've done--even if it costs him his life. They picked the wrong old man to mess with. And as the fury and violence escalate, they're about to learn that--the hard way. Includes a bonus novella, The Passenger. (August)</description>

Latch following his disappearance on June 19, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tapes are part of the evidentiary record in the civil case of Latch V. Weymouth Life &amp;amp; Casualty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William J.

  <description>I had just turned fourteen years old the night my best friends and I decided to kill Mr. Martinsen. He was my friend. My mentor. I would even go so far as to say I loved him, as I looked up to Mr. Martinsen the same way I had looked up to my maternal grandfather, who died from a heart attack when I was ten. He was the best teacher I ever had. I will never forget him, or the knowledge he imparted to me, as long as I live. But on that summer evening just several weeks before I began my freshman year of high school, he gave my friends and me no choice. Things had gone too far. We had put it off for too long. We knew Mr. Martinsen had to die.</description>

  <description>The narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Bottoms&lt;/i&gt; is Harry Collins, an old man obsessively reflecting on certain key experiences of his childhood. In 1933, the year that forms the centerpiece of the narrative, Harry is 11 years old and living with his mother, father, and younger sister on a farm outside of Marvel Creek, Texas, near the Sabine River bottoms. Harry's world changes forever when he discovers the corpse of a young black woman tied to a tree in the forest near his home. The woman, who is eventually identified as a local prostitute, has been murdered, molested, and sexually mutilated. She is also, as Harry will soon discover, the first in a series of similar corpses, all of them the victims of a new, unprecedented sort of monster: a traveling serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his privileged position as the son of constable (and farmer and part-time barber) Jacob Collins, Harry watches as the distinctly amateur investigation unfolds. As more bodies -- not all of them "colored" -- surface, the mood of the local residents darkens. Racial tensions -- never far from the surface, even in the best of times -- gradually kindle. When circumstantial evidence implicates an ancient, innocent black man named Mose, the Ku Klux Klan mobilizes, initiating a chilling, graphically described lynching that will occupy a permanent place in Harry Collins's memories. With Mose dead and the threat to local white women presumably put to rest, the residents of Marvel Creek resume their normal lives, only to find that the actual killer remains at large and continues to threaten the safety and stability of the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lansdale uses this protracted murder investigation to open up a window on an insular, poverty-stricken, racially divided community. With humor, precision, and great narrative economy, he evokes the society of Marvel Creek in all its alternating tawdriness and nobility, offering us a varied, absolutely convincing portrait of a world that has receded into history. At the same time, he offers us a richly detailed re-creation of the vibrant, dangerous physical landscapes that were part of that world and have since been buried under the concrete and cement of the industrialized juggernaut of the late 20th century. In Lansdale's hands, the gritty realities of Depression-era Texas are as authentic -- and memorable -- as anything in recent American fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Out of the blue, Rebecca Stafford’s Father arrives to parent her after years of absence. He then extracts her last bit of normalcy by moving them to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. The shocking news plunges Rebecca into a despair that brings about an otherworldly encounter; she begins to have visions of her deceased Mom.&lt;br /&gt;Uncertain whether what she sees is reality or the product of a troubled mind, Rebecca searches for an anchor to keep her from drifting in the new coastal town. She clings to Shawn, the eccentric, spritely boy-next-door promising adventures…with surprises of his own, involving an Irish legend and a hidden lighthouse. This brings on a whole new dimension to Rebecca’s visions, and sparks feverish romance between her and Shawn. A bond eventually threatened by forces beyond her control, sending her spiralling into dark, stormy places, leaving her to wonder how broken a mind can get</description>

  <description>I am not a monster. Ray Bridges, a professional electronics salesman, is looking for love in all the strange places. He spends most nights sneaking into support group meetings for the disabled in order to satisfy his deepest, darkest desires-to hook up with unfortunate, down-on-their-luck women who've recently lost a limb. There's a name for Ray's preference; it's called acrotomophilia, a paraphilia involving amputees.Conflicted, Ray wishes he could change. But he can't. His body won't let him. Nor will his mind. He's destined to live this life, forever. That is . . . until he meets the perfect girl. Falls in love with her. Only problem: her arms and legs are attached.Unable to find her attractive, Ray embarks on a dark, twisted journey of self-discovery, one that will force him to make an impossible choice: abandon his pursuit of true love or find a way to make it work, even if that means getting the girl of his dreams to shed an appendage. Weird, comedic, and often raunchy, Limbs is the craziest love story ever told.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the sixth and final thriller of the “wildly entertaining” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) Miriam Black series, Miriam tries to break the curse of her powers, but first she must face The Trespasser a final time. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still reeling from the events of &lt;i&gt;The Raptor and the Wren&lt;/i&gt;, Miriam must confront two terrifying discoveries: the Trespasser now has the power to inhabit the living as well as the dead, and Miriam is pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam knows her baby is fated to die, but Miriam is the Fatebreaker. And if the rules have changed for her nemesis, her own powers are changing as well. Miriam will do whatever it takes to break her curse and save her child. But as Miriam once again finds herself on the hunt for a serial killer and in need of an elusive physic, she can feel the threads of her past coming together—and the pattern they’re forming is deadly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end the Trespasser’s influence in her world, Miriam must face her demon a final time. And, this time, one of them must die. Vultures is a heart-pounding conclusion to the series: “Think &lt;i&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/i&gt; cowritten by Stephen King and Chuck Palahniuk” (&lt;i&gt;SFX&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>In the early 80’s — at the height of the ultra-violent “Italian cannibal” grindhouse film craze — a small international cast and crew descend on an isolated Caribbean island, hoping to crassly exploit the native talent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the angry, undead spirits of the island have a different, more original script in mind. And as horror after staggering horror unfolds, the camera keeps rolling. To the blood-spattered end...</description>

  <description>A young family receives a surprise when old Uncle Ian dies and leaves them a cottage in north Wales. For Ian’s nephew and his wife Ann, it seems a stroke of incredible good fortune, enabling them to leave their life in the city for a newfound freedom in the remote seaside cottage. There’s just one catch. Uncle Ian’s will has an unusual condition: the couple must care for his pet cormorant or forfeit the bequest. The will’s provision seems harmless enough at first, but when their young son Harry develops a strange fascination for the increasingly sinister and malevolent bird, they soon find that Uncle Ian’s gift may not be a blessing, but a curse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A chilling ghost story with a twist: the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Winter People&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; returns to the woods of Vermont to tell the story of a husband and wife who don't simply move into a haunted house, they start building one from scratch, without knowing it, until it's too late . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of "Breckenridge women," each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.</description>

  <description>As the Halloween season approaches, the newest residents of small town Eminence are hard at work opening a haunted house attraction called Hellsworld Hotel. The local townsfolk are excited, especially the teenagers. Normally you would have to drive to one of the big cities for something like this. But local Sheriff Stan Maxell is skeptical, even more so when he takes notice of how many of the young people in his town are disappearing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hellsworld Hotel is a tale of family horror in the vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and House of 1000 Corpses, brought to you by the author of The ADHD Vampire and Fast Times at Cine Mega Plex High.</description>

  <description>For most of her fourteen years, Tasha Davis has languished in the rural-suburban town of Skillute, Washington. Her parents offer plenty of comfortable—if stifling—emotional support, but what she needs is a best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her final year at Clark Middle School, Tasha meets a strange, new classmate. Briar Kenny is the self-styled rebel Tasha wants to be, and the Davises are the kind of close-knit family Briar covets. A moment of unexpected violence spawns a secret between the two girls and awakens a mystery from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown to Tasha and Briar, their secret also attracts something monstrous from a forgotten corner of Skillute. The town is haunted by its history, scarred with the lingering spirit of broken and scattered families, abandoned real estate ventures, and old scores never settled between neighbors. But there’s more to the place than memory and legend. Beneath the landscape something malignant rages, and it will stop at nothing to find a route into the physical world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover art and design by Mikio Murakami.</description>

  <description>A recurrent, unidentifiable noise in her apartment. A memo to her boss that's replaced by obscene insults. Amanda—a successful architect in a happy marriage—finds her life going off kilter by degrees. She starts smoking again, and one night for no reason, without even the knowledge that she's doing it, she burns her husband with a cigarette. At night she dreams of a beautiful woman with pointed teeth on the shore of a blood-red sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new voice in Amanda's head, the one that tells her to steal things and talk to strange men in bars, is strange and frightening, and Amanda struggles to wrest back control of her life. A book on demon possession suggests that the figure on the shore could be the demon Naamah, known to scholars of the Kabbalah as the second wife of Adam, who stole into his dreams and tricked him into fathering her child. Whatever the case, as the violence of her erratic behavior increases, Amanda knows that she must act to put her life right, or see it destroyed.</description>

  <description>Jeff looked over his shoulder back to the hidden pigpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl was all he could see. Pearl. Sitting on his ass like a person might, his front hooves limp at the sides of his belly, his head was cocked slightly to the side, his pink ears straight high above his head. His bad eye looked dark, hidden, but his good one was fixed on Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it, Jeff saw an intelligence that scared him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half smile appeared under the pig's snout, or maybe it was just the way his lips naturally curled up at their ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff fingered the latch. Pearl watched him. Staring. Assessing. Planning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff pulled his fingers away. A streak of shame ran down his back, like he'd come close to letting something very bad out of the pen...</description>

  <description>Aside from a quaint amusement park, the small town of Lakeview offers little excitement for Duane, Savannah, and their friends. They're about to endure their ten-year high school reunion when their lives are shattered by the arrival of an ancient, vengeful evil. The werewolf. The first attack leaves seven dead and four wounded. And though the beast remains on the loose and eager to spill more blood, the sleepy resort town is about to face an even greater terror. Because the four victims of the werewolf's fury are changing. They're experiencing unholy desires and unimaginable cravings. They'll prey on the innocent and the depraved. They'll settle old scores and act on their basest desires. Soon, they'll plunge the entire town into nightmare. Lakeview is about to become Wolf Land. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launching in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>When family man Joe Crawford confronts a young mother abusing her toddler, he has no idea of the chain reaction he's setting in motion. How could he suspect the young mother is part of an ancient fire cult, a sinister group of killers that will destroy anyone who threatens one of its members? When the little boy is placed in a foster home, the fanatics begin their mission of terror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the cult leaders will summon their deadliest hunters-and a ferocious supernatural evil-to make Joe pay for what he's done. They want Joe's blood and the blood of his family. And they want their child back.</description>

  <description>IT WAS JUST A CAMPING TRIP &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down by the old Coheelee Creek Covered Bridge, four high school friends only wanted to kick back, smoke some weed and forget about their problems for a day or two. Sure, there were stories that the area was haunted, but there was no way they were true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS JUST A LOCAL LEGEND &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades earlier, an old goat farmer had been murdered by the Klan, hung from a tree near the bridge solely because of the color of his skin. His body was never found. Since then, numerous sightings of a strange creature—half-man and half-goat—had been reported in the surrounding woods. He was called the Goatman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS JUST THE WORST NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they arrived, strange noises echoed around them… a sense that they were being watched pervaded the campsite… and that was just the beginning. When one of them vanishes and a horned monstrosity pursues the others, it becomes clear that the legends are real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…and the truth is so much more horrific than they could ever have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Justin M. Woodward isn't playing around--this is a terrifying descent into depravity." -Jeff Strand (Author of Sick House) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Dark, twisted, and full of surprises.” -Duncan Ralston (Author of WOOM and Salvage) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Woodward is the kind of dick who invites himself into your nightmares, and Tamer Animals is the key he uses to open the door.” -J. Z. Foster (Author of The Wicked Ones and Witch Hunter)</description>

  <description>Jesse thinks he's caught a break when he, Emma (the girl of his dreams), and her friend are assigned by their newspaper to cover the opening weekend of a sprawling new state park. But the construction of the park has stirred an evil that has lain dormant for nearly a hundred years, and the three young people--as well as every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to be attending the Algonquin Falls grand opening--are about to encounter the most horrific creatures to ever walk the earth. Charly has three young children and a jerk for a husband, a hot shot girls basketball coach with a penchant for seducing his female assistants. When Charly's baby is kidnapped by one of the creatures, she turns to Sam Bledsoe, the man who constructed her house (and the man on whom she has developed a sizable crush) for help. Sam, Charly, her husband, and the newest hot assistant coach soon find themselves underground and on the trail of Charly's baby. Jesse's trio, a group of professors, and Frank Red Elk--a Native American who specializes in women and booze--take refuge in the caves hoping to find a way out of the park. But like Charly and the others, Jesse's crew will soon learn just how monstrous the creatures are. And how cunning. Together, they will all try to save Charly's baby, escape with their lives, and take down as many of the monsters as they can. But the creatures are hungry. They delight in human suffering. And they will stop at nothing to prove that they are the dominant species. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launching in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

And then finds himself trapped in a waking nightmare with no way out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-A frustrated man who curses life for having the audacity to pass him by, but discovers how it feels to be truly forsaken when the universe chooses to teach him a horrible lesson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-An outcast who must decide between vengeance and forgiveness in a world turned upside down by war and famine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-A woman on trial in a world where telling the truth is a crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-A man who is living with a very odd houseguest, a visitor who has no concept of war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-A boy who lives in constant terror of someone who is supposed to love and protect him, but who has betrayed that trust.

  <description>You don't read the book. It reads you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors of a deadly book have been floating around the dark corners of the deep web. A disturbing tale about a mysterious figure who preys on those who read the book and subjects them to a world of personalized terror. Jesse Wheeler--former guitarist of the heavy metal group The Rising Dead--was quick to discount the ominous folklore associated with the book. It takes more than some urban legend to frighten him. Hell, reality is scary enough. Seven years ago his greatest responsibility was the nightly guitar solo. Then one night when Jesse was blackout drunk, he accidentally injured his son, leaving him permanently disabled. Dreams of being a rock star died when he destroyed his son's future. Now he cuts radio jingles and fights to stay clean. But Jesse is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legend is real--and tonight he will become the protagonist in an elaborate scheme specifically tailored to prey on his fears and resurrect the ghosts from his past. Jesse is not the only one in danger, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reading the book, you have volunteered to participate in the author's deadly game, with every page drawing you closer to your own personalized nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real horror doesn't begin until you reach the end. That's when the evil comes for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame Tree Press is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>J is a student at a school deep in a forest far away from the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; J is one of only twenty-six students, all of whom think of the school’s enigmatic founder as their father. J’s peers are the only family he has ever had. The students are being trained to be prodigies of art, science, and athletics, and their life at the school is all they know—and all they are allowed to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But J suspects that there is something out there, beyond the pines, that the founder does not want him to see, and he’s beginning to ask questions. What is the real purpose of this place? Why can the students never leave? And what secrets is their father hiding from them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, in a school very much like J’s, a girl named K is asking the same questions. J has never seen a girl, and K has never seen a boy. As K and J work to investigate the secrets of their two strange schools, they come to discover something even more mysterious: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Andrew Pyper returns with a riveting psychological thriller about how the people you’ve known your whole life can suddenly become strangers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if everything you knew about the people you loved was a lie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of their absentee father, Aaron and Bridge Quinlan travel to a vast rainforest property in the Pacific Northwest to hear the reading of his will. There, they meet up with their mother and troubled sister, Franny, and are shocked to discover the will’s terms: in order to claim their inheritance they must remain at the estate for thirty days without any contact with the outside world. Despite their concerns, they agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quinlans soon come to learn their family has more secrets than they ever imagined—revelations that at first inspire curiosity, then fear. Why does Bridge have faint memories of the estate? Why did their father want them to be sequestered there together? And what is out there they feel pulling them into the dark heart of the woods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Homecoming&lt;/i&gt; is at once a gripping mystery, a chilling exploration of how our memories can both define and betray us, and a riveting page-turner that will have you questioning your very existence.</description>

  <description>The day that Lorrie “accidentally” cuts off her little toe, she discovers what it’s like to be able-bodied and not want that body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Bartholomew loses his left arm to a Sunni sniper, he’s inspired to start a new kind of church―one where both amputation and sex are types of performance art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trice, a prosthetics engineer, receives the assignment of a lifetime when he’s asked to rebuild his son’s crippled frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the memory of his dead wife, George must take the ultimate measure to excise her ghost. For good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From sexual fetish to the clinical diagnosis of Body Integrity Identity Disorder, Headcheese makes the first cut, peeling back the epidermis to peer inside the minds and hearts of 26 people navigating the topography of flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess Hagemann is an award-winning author and accomplished biographer. She lives in a quiet Austin neighborhood surrounded on three sides by cows. Headcheese is her first novel.</description>

  <description>Some men only know how to do hard things the hard way! The battered women who drifted into the District Attorney's office all haunted him with the same, hard-bought lie: "I want to drop the charges." Every bruised face and split lip reminded the assistant D.A. of the violent home he'd escaped and how little he could do to prevent others' suffering at the hands and fists of the same kind of monster who'd raised him. But when Marisol Pierce appeared with an image of her son and a hint that she was willing to take a step away from the man abusing her, the prosecutor made a promise he knew he couldn't keep. A promise that could cost him everything. Bracken MacLeod's novella, "White Knight," appears back in print, for the first time together with several of his acclaimed crime and suspense stories written for Shotgun Honey, Beat to a Pulp, and Shock Totem, along with an interview with the author and brand new story notes. WHITE KNIGHT AND OTHER PAWNS is a tour through noir, hardboiled, and even an EC Comics-inspired "SuspenStory" - This is crime writing the way only Bracken MacLeod does it.</description>

  <description>Winter it's coming... it's already here, and with it comes a horror no door can keep out. It's there in the yard, in the faces of the snowmen a young boy doesn't remember building. It's in the oddly empty streets below Santa Claus's crumbling sleigh. It's in the unnatural movement of the snow that suffocates a widower's town, and in the cold eyes of a lonely man's estranged children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, there is no holiday cheer, only spine-chilling fear, in the DEAD OF WINTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring seven stories, an introduction by the author, and a list of recommended books for the winter season.</description>

  <description>At the center of S.P. Miskowski's novel-length fairy tale are three restless girls, best friends stuck in the backwater of Skillute, Washington in the late 1960s. Their neighbors and families are petty or poor, or both. They warn the girls not to wander into the dense forest. Something evil lurks there, people say. The girls are not convinced. During a playful oath, they wander too far into the woods. Their mistake unleashes a malignant spirit that terrorizes Skillute for the next fifty years.</description>

  <description>In Gabino Iglesias’ second novel, ghosts and old gods guide the hands of those caught up in a violent struggle to save the soul of the American southwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man tasked with shuttling children over the border believes the Virgin Mary is guiding him towards final justice. A woman offers colonizer blood to the Mother of Chaos. A boy joins corpse destroyers to seek vengeance for the death of his father.These stories intertwine with those of a vengeful spirit and a hungry creature to paint a timely, compelling, pulpy portrait of revenge, family, and hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Call him the Barrio Palahniuk, a badass Henry Miller, Charles Willeford in Cholo-land—whatever the moniker, for my money Gabino Iglesias is one of the most fearless, original and riveting writers working today.” – Jerry Stahl, author of Permanent Midnight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Iglesias is a master of compact phrasing and perfectly paced suspense.” - Los Angeles Review of Books</description>

  <description>I'll be seeing you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the note left behind for Ivy Longwood when infamous killer Tucker Ashton murders her boyfriend. Several years later, after Tucker vanishes from his jail cell, Ivy travels to Ashton's hometown of Marlowe, Massachusetts. Not for closure or therapy. She's being called there. Steered by forces beyond her control. What she'll find is not the quiet suburban town Marlowe once was. It's something new. Something dark. Something that answers the question: Where did Tucker Ashton go?</description>

  <description>A chilling collection of psychological suspense and literary horror from the multiple award-winning author of the national bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Cabin at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful anthology featuring nineteen pieces of short fiction, &lt;em&gt;Growing Things&lt;/em&gt; is an exciting glimpse into Paul Tremblay’s fantastically fertile imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “The Teacher,” a Bram Stoker Award nominee for best short story, a student is forced to watch a disturbing video that will haunt and torment her and her classmates’ lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four men rob a pawn shop at gunpoint only to vanish, one-by-one, as they speed away from the crime scene in “The Getaway.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “Swim Wants to Know If It’s as Bad as Swim Thinks,” a meth addict kidnaps her daughter from her estranged mother as their town is terrorized by a giant monster... or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining these haunting works are stories linked to Tremblay’s previous novels. The tour de force metafictional novella “Notes from the Dog Walkers” deconstructs horror and publishing, possibly bringing in a character from &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;, all while serving as a prequel to &lt;em&gt;Disappearance at Devil’s Rock.&lt;/em&gt; “The Thirteenth Temple” follows another character from &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;—Merry, who has published a tell-all memoir written years after the events of the novel. And the title story, “Growing Things,” a shivery tale loosely shared between the sisters in &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts,&lt;/em&gt; is told here in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From global catastrophe to the demons inside our heads, Tremblay illuminates our primal fears and darkest dreams in startlingly original fiction that leaves us unmoored. As he lowers the sky and yanks the ground from beneath our feet, we are compelled to contemplate the darkness inside our own hearts and minds.</description>

  <description>Ten writers are selected for a summer-long writing retreat with the most celebrated and reclusive author in the world. Their host is the legendary Roderick Wells. Handsome, enigmatic, and fiendishly talented, Wells promises to teach his pupils about writing, about magic, about the untapped potential that each of them possesses. Most of all, he plans to teach them about the darkness in their hearts. The writers think they are signing up for a chance at riches and literary prestige. But they are really entering the twisted imagination of a deranged genius, a lethal contest pitting them against one another in a struggle for their sanity and their lives. They have entered into Roderick Wells's most brilliant and horrible creation. The Dark Game. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eighteen stories of Christmas horror from bestselling, acclaimed authors including Scott Smith, Seanan McGuire, Josh Malerman, Michael Koryta, Sarah Pinborough, and many more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That there is darkness at the heart of the Yuletide season should not surprise. Charles Dickens' &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol &lt;/i&gt;is filled with scenes that are unsettling. Marley untying the bandage that holds his jaws together. The hideous children--Want and Ignorance--beneath the robe of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The heavy ledgers Marley drags by his chains. In the finest versions of this story, the best parts are the terrifying parts. &lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author and editor Christopher Golden shares his love for Christmas horror stories with this anthology of all-new short fiction from some of the most talented and original writers of horror today.</description>

  <description>He’s run away from home. That’s what they say every time one of Charley Winslow’s friends vanishes from The Old Cross School for Boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just a tall tale. That’s what they tell Charley when he sees the ragged grey figure stalking the abbey halls at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Charley follows his pet insects to a pool of blood behind a false wall, he could run and let those stones bury their secrets. He could assimilate, focus on his studies, and wait for his father to send for him. Or he could walk the dark tunnels of the school’s heart, scour its abandoned passages, and pick at the scab of a family’s legacy of madness and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of Sam Forster, the school’s gardener, and Matron Grace, the staff nurse, Charley unravels Old Cross’ history and exposes a scandal stretching back to when the school was a home with a noble family and a dark secret—a secret that still haunts its halls with scraping steps, twisting its bones into a new generation of nightmares.</description>

  <description>Menacing dark fantasy/horror and paranormal suspense combine in the final book of this reader acclaimed supernatural series (Gabriel Davenport) from British author Beverley Lee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood calls to blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Davenport and his brothers have found a temporary refuge. But safety is fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;Beneath the streets of London three become five, as the brothers, the "Bloody Little Prophets," are joined by a witch boy sent on a mission and a terrified, persecuted vampire.&lt;br /&gt;But every meeting has its consequences. And one of them is not who he says he is.&lt;br /&gt;One by one, the brothers are torn apart, and all must face their own demons when unexpected questions and uncertainty arise. &lt;br /&gt;Gabriel's quest takes him to the very edge of his morality—to a creature who holds the key to death itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would he give to know why the wings of darkness had always sought him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what would any of them sacrifice to save each other?</description>

  <description>4 short stories, 4 novelettes, 4 novellas, and 4 graphic adaptations make up this mammoth book of wonders, but here's the catch: every single story in this anthology is a collaboration. Bram Stoker Award winners Michael Bailey and Lucy A. Snyder even co-edited the anthology to bring you an incredibly diverse and entirely collaborative dark fiction experience. Includes a co-introduction by Gary A. Braunbeck and Janet Harriett!</description>

  <description>Daniel is desperate for a job. When someone slides a note under his door offering him the groundskeeper's position at an old estate, it seems too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Alarm bells start ringing when he arrives at Craven Manor. The mansion's front door hangs open, and leaves and cobwebs coat the marble foyer. It's clear no one has lived there in a long time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But an envelope waits for him inside the doorway. It contains money, and promises more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Daniel is desperate. Against his better judgement, he moves into the groundskeeper's cottage behind the crypt. He's determined to ignore the strange occurrences that plague the estate.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But when a candle flickers to life in the abandoned tower window, Daniel realises Craven Manor is hiding a terrible secret... one that threatens to bury him with it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Shadeland and Eddie Blaze are the hottest young music composers in Hollywood. Fresh off an Oscar nomination, they've just been chosen to score a big-budget horror movie by Lee Stanley, the most demanding director in film. But Ben, the creative half of the duo, hasn't written a note since his wife divorced him and got custody of their three-year-old son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Blackwood is the gambling-addicted heir to the Blackwood fortune, which includes the Sorrows, an island off the coast of northern California. The island and its castle have been uninhabited since a series of gruesome, unexplained murders in 1925, but Chris needs money, and to get it he allows Ben, Eddie, Claire Harden (an aspiring composer), and Eva Rosales (Lee Stanley's gorgeous assistant) to stay a month in Castle Blackwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddie is certain an eerie, isolated setting is just what Ben needs to find musical inspiration for a horror film. But what they find is more horrific than any movie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Amityville baywoman Ellie West fishes by day and bootlegs moonshine by night. It's dangerous work under Prohibition--independent operators like her are despised by federal agents and mobsters alike--but Ellie's brother was accepted to college and Ellie's desperate to see him go. So desperate that when wealthy strangers ask her to procure libations for an extravagant party, Ellie sells them everything she has, including some booze she acquired under unusual circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What Ellie doesn't know is that this booze is special. Distilled from foul mushrooms by a cult of diabolists, those who drink it see terrible things--like the destruction of Long Island in fire and flood. The cult is masquerading as a church promising salvation through temperance and a return to "the good old days," so it's hard for Ellie to take a stand against them, especially when her father joins - but Ellie loves Long Island, and she loves her family, and she'll do whatever it takes to ensure neither is torn apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When he's not holding down a dead-end job or lurking in his mother's basement, Tony Anastos spends his time shooting ultra-low-budget horror flicks. After meeting his sexy fame-hungry coworker Anna, he sees an opportunity to launch his career into cult stardom. But when Tony's plan to jolt their next film's Kickstarter into overdrive calls for real blood, he will sacrifice the last bit of his humanity for a shot at recognition. But it makes sense. Look at him. The stuff he makes, I mean, he's the first one you expect.</description>

  <description>A darkly comic short story, a fable about the all too real impact that we humans have on the environment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fox 8 has always been known as the daydreamer in his pack, the one his fellow foxes regarded with a knowing snort and a roll of the eyes. That is, until Fox 8 develops a unique skill: He teaches himself to speak “Yuman” by hiding in the bushes outside a house and listening to children’s bedtime stories. The power of language fuels his abundant curiosity about people—even after “danjer” arrives in the form of a new shopping mall that cuts off his food supply, sending Fox 8 on a harrowing quest to help save his pack.</description>

  <description>DEVOURING DARK is an urban horror novel about a man plagued since childhood by a malevolent darkness that threatens to consume him. After a lifetime spent wrestling for control over this onslaught, Matt McLeod has learned to wield his mysterious paranormal skill to achieve an odious goal: retribution as a supernatural vigilante.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one such hit goes bad, McLeod finds himself ensnared in a multi-tentacled criminal enterprise caught between a corrupt cop and a brutal mobster. His only promise of salvation may be a bewitching woman who shares his dark talent but has murderous designs of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gritty thriller DEVOURING DARK is based on Baxter’s award-winning short story “Shadows of the Lonely Dead” and will be available worldwide on November 6, 2018.</description>

  <description>Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face–including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.</description>

  <description>David Botham just wants a quiet ordinary life―his job at the travel agency, his relationship with his girlfriend Stephanie. The online blog that uses a title he once thought up has nothing to do with him. He has no idea who is writing it or where they get their information about a series of violent deaths in Liverpool. If they’re murders, how can the killer go unseen even by security cameras? Perhaps David won’t know until they come too close to him―until he can’t ignore the figure from his past that is catching up with him…</description>

  <description>No matter where you are in the world, there is a story that everyone knows. In every town, every village, there is a house no one sets foot in; a specter in the woods that parents warn their children of; a local landmark whose history is stained with death. Shadows at the Door brings the whispered, hand-me-down horrors of thirteen such places together, to entertain and unsettle. The anthology will immerse you in the eerie locales of Durham, Norfolk, Derbyshire, Rugby, the Scottish Highlands, Toronto, Pittsburgh, New York, Rural Yorkshire, Lake Superior, Canterbury and Melbourne, so you can be scared all around the globe.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5!<br />I enjoyed this novella as a buddy read with horror-loving friends, Emily, Tracy and Mindi. The 4 of us had a group chat going so we could share ideas while we read.<br />As far as first impressions go, this one makes quite an impact. Chapter One starts off with a little prologue that is...]]>

  <description>Life in a slasher film is easy. You just have to know when to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aerial View: A suburban town in Texas. Everyone's got an automatic garage door opener. All the kids jump off a perilous cliff into a shallow river as a rite of passage. The sheriff is a local celebrity. You know this town. You're from this town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoom In: Homecoming princess, Lindsay. She's just barely escaped death at the hands of a brutal, sadistic murderer in a Michael Jackson mask. Up on the cliff, she was rescued by a horse and bravely defeated the killer, alone, bra-less. Her story is already a legend. She's this town's heroic final girl, their virgin angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monster Vision: Halloween masks floating down that same river the kids jump into. But just as one slaughter is not enough for Billie Jean, our masked killer, one victory is not enough for Lindsay. Her high school is full of final girls, and she's not the only one who knows the rules of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lindsay chooses a host of virgins, misfits, and former final girls to replace the slaughtered members of her original homecoming court, it's not just a fight for survival-it's a fight to become The Last Final Girl.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Jeremy C. Shipp, the Bram Stoker Award-nominated author of &lt;i&gt;The Atrocities&lt;/i&gt;, comes a tense dark fantasy novel of psychological horror in &lt;i&gt;Bedfellow&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It broke into their home and set up residence in their minds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the . . . thing first insinuated itself into the Lund family household, they were bemused. Vaguely human-shaped, its constantly-changing cravings seemed disturbing, at first, but time and pressure have a way of normalizing the extreme. Wasn’t it always part of their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the family make more and greater sacrifices in service to the beast, the thrall that binds them begins to break down. Choices must be made. Prices must be paid. And the Lunds must pit their wits against a creature determined to never let them go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's psychological warfare. Sanity is optional.</description>

  <description>First he gave us &lt;i&gt;Little Deaths: The Definitive Edition&lt;/i&gt;. Then he unleashed his unique brand of pain in &lt;i&gt;The End in All Beginnings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram Stoker Award-nominated John F.D. Taff – modern horror’s King of Pain – returns with &lt;i&gt;Little Black Spots&lt;/i&gt;. Sixteen stories of dark horror fiction gathered together for the first time, exposing the delicate blemishes and sinister blots that tarnish the human condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a man who stumbles on a cult that glorifies spontaneous human combustion, to a disgraced nature photographer who applies his skills for a vile outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where a darkened city parking structure seems malevolently alive, and a Halloween costume has a husband seeing his wife in a disturbing new light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a ruined man sees far too much of himself in his broken family, and a mysterious bottle of liquid arrives with a deadly secret inside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Black Spots is a beacon shining its light into some of life's most shadowy corners, revealing the dark stains that spatter all mankind.</description>

  <description>The boys crept to the window and watched as Miss Maggie carried the long bundle into the barn, the weight of it stooping her aging back. Rafter lights spilled from the barn doors and Davey saw an arm fall from the canvas-wrapped parcel. He smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She got someone!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both children grinned and settled in their beds, eyes fixed to the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was family growth.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Black Spring, a picturesque town with an ugly secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 17th century woman with sewn-shut eyes and mouth walks its streets... enters its homes... watches its people while they sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The call her the Black Rock Witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So accustomed to her presence, the townsfolk often forget what will happen if her eyes ever open. To protect themselves the Black Spring elders use high-tech surveillance to quarantine the town. Frustrated with the lockdown, the town's teenagers decide to break the rules and go viral with the haunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no one foresees the dark nightmare that awaits them all.</description>

  <description>Regina Corsi is a monster, the vilest of predators. Her desire for young boys is only matched by the bloodlust that overcomes her once the sex is finished. But she’s grown hasty in her hunting. And only a special friend can keep her disturbing appetites a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevada Barnes is fourteen, and, emotionally speaking, still very much a child. When his stable home life is thrown into turmoil by an unexpected visitor, he escapes into the arms of an older woman, where he will find his own desire growing stronger each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Bay’s End, Regina and Nevada dive head first into a relationship doomed for disaster, a sex-fueled madness neither will be able to satiate. But Regina’s special friend is impatient and will not be distracted by their love affair. It will feed, whether Regina wills it to or not. For the bedding of boys has consequences that reach far beyond the legal ramifications of her actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ghost is hungry, only death will do.</description>

  <description>Stephen Gregory uses the medieval castle and town walls of Caernarfon as the backdrop for his latest dark and disturbing novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When David Kewish suffers an excruciating accident on his eighteenth birthday, the whole of his summer is blighted... and when a fledgling black-backed gull comes tapping at his front door in the middle of the night, and the town is besieged by flocks of gulls, it is this bird which fuels the tension of the story and increases the friction between the characters.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The monsters live inside of Kate Woodson. Chronic pain and a host of autoimmune diseases have robbed her of a normal, happy life. Her husband Andrew’s surprise of their dream Maine lake cottage for the summer is the gift of a lifetime. It’s beautiful, remote, idyllic, a place to heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they are not alone. Something is in the woods, screeching in the darkness, banging on the house, leaving animals for dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like her body, Kate’s cottage becomes her prison. She and Andrew must fight to survive the creature that lurks in the dead of night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The world’s fate lies with a comatose young girl; an android wants to remember a human she once knew under Martian skies; men at sea learn that the ocean is a realm far different from land, where an unforgiving god rules; a school security guard discovers extreme English class; and a man understands what the behemoth beneath the sea commands of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Was a Fair Master is a collection of 23 stories, riding the currents of fantasy, science fiction, crime, and horror. There are tales of murder, death, loss, revenge, greed, and hate. There are also tales of hope, survival, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sea was a fair master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A collection of dark and fierce flash. Demmer’s short tales of horror and the weird will delight, disturb, and unsettle readers.” — Maria Haskins, author of Dark Flash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Calvin Demmer has a lean writing style that is delicious in collections. These short stories deliver punches to the reader and then end before a recovery is possible!” — Somer Canon, author of Killer Chronicles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“THE SEA WAS A FAIR MASTER is a literary kaleidoscope made from flesh with razor-sharp fragments twisting inside to form a bloody trunkful of blending images and genres, sci-fi and crime and horror mix to reveal vignettes as terse and surprising as a night of binge-watching The Twilight Zone. Demmer leaves no fear untouched – sharks and clowns and serial killers pepper these stories, daring the reader to turn the page, not knowing what fresh horror awaits them. A strong debut by a masterful new voice in horror. Don’t miss it.” — Philip Fracassi, author of Behold the Void&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Demmer’s debut moves like a rabid dog straining against its chain. Each story hits like a flash of sharp teeth, every tale snarling with its own sudden bite. This is an engaging first collection from a versatile new talent.” — Karen Runge, author of Seeing Double&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Connection. Disconnection. Loneliness. Love. Friendship. Murder. These are but a few of the elements of great horror, and Calvin Demmer expertly blends each one into his fiction—to a supremely devastating and unsettling effect.” — Gwendolyn Kiste, author of And Her Smile Will Untether the Universe</description>

  <description>A young woman's fears regarding the gruesome photos appearing on her cell phone prove justified in a ghastly and unexpected way. A chainsaw-wielding Evil Dead fan defends herself against a trio of undead intruders. A bride-to-be comes to wish that the door between the physical and spiritual worlds had stayed shut on All Hallows' Eve. A lone passenger on a midnight train finds that the engineer has rerouted them toward a past she'd prefer to forget. A mother abandons a life she no longer recognizes as her own to walk up a mysterious staircase in the woods. In her debut collection, Christa Carmen combines horror, charm, humor, and social critique to shape thirteen haunting, harrowing narratives of women struggling with both otherworldly and real-world problems. From grief, substance abuse, and mental health disorders, to a post-apocalyptic exodus, a seemingly sinister babysitter with unusual motivations, and a group of pesky ex-boyfriends who won't stay dead, Something Borrowed, Something Blood-Soaked is a compelling exploration of horrors both supernatural and psychological, and an undeniable affirmation of Carmen's flair for short fiction.</description>

  <description>On the outskirts of Dublin City, a young couple’s relationship hangs by a thread. Isolated and stressed, disputes turn physical, leaving a pregnant Erin Greene in a poor state of mental health, and Philip Montague wanting an escape. They decide to go on a drive and head for Erin’s favourite place as a child, the Wicklow Mountains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a simple oversight leaves them both stranded, with no fuel and a blizzard due. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other choice, Philip heads off to the nearest town in search of help, leaving his fiancée alone. With Philip gone and the inevitability of a snowstorm looming, Erin, in order to survive, must battle against her plagued mind and the supernatural elements that lie hidden deep in the hills.</description>

  <description>"My name is Levi. I’m 16. I’ve got a skull for a face. And here's how shit went down." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never been outside the walls of Gramm Jones Foster Care Facility, sixteen-year-old Levi leaves in the middle of the night with an empty backpack and a newfound lust for life. A journey that leads him into the arms of delusional newlyweds, drunkards, polygamists, the dangerous, and the batshit crazy. His destination? Hermosa Beach, California where he's told there is another like him, with the face of a skull. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coming-of-age road trip filled with surreal Lynch-ian encounters exploring the dark, the disturbing, and the lonely in a 1980s world—an epic venture for one disfigured boy struggling to find his place in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is Huck lighting out for the territories, and kind of documenting an era for us on the way. Only--because it’s now not then--he’s got a skull face to deal with. As do we all. " ~Stephen Graham Jones, author of Mongrels</description>

For those who find they love a good scare, that first taste can grow into a voracious appetite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That might be why you’re looking at this book right now. If so, you’ve come to the right place. Doorbells at Dusk is a treasury of brand-new Halloween tales from both modern masters and rising stars of dark fiction, horror and suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the thrills you crave, packed into a collection of stories that's pure Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carve your pumpkins and turn on the porch light, Halloween frights begin with the sound of…DOORBELLS AT DUSK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring stories by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•	Sean Eads&lt;br /&gt;•	Amber Fallon&lt;br /&gt;•	Charles Gramlich&lt;br /&gt;•	Joanna Koch&lt;br /&gt;•	Curtis M.

  <description>Spring, 1983. Sally Ride is about to go into space. Flashdance is a cultural phenomenon. And in Times Square, two very deadly women are on a collision course with destiny-- and each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At twenty-one, Ginny Kurva is already legendary on 42nd Street. To the pimp for whom she works, she's the perfect weapon-- a martial artist capable of taking down men twice her size. To the girls in her stable, she's mother, teacher, and protector. To the little sister she cares for, she's a hero. Yet Ginny's bravado and icy confidence hides a mind at the breaking point, her sanity slowly slipping away as both her addictions and the sins of her past catch up with her... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At thirty-seven, Nicolette Aster is the most respected woman at the landfill where she works. Quiet and competent, she's admired by the secretaries and trusted by her supervisors. Yet those around her have no idea how Nicolette spends her nights-- when the hateful madness she keeps repressed by day finally emerges, and she turns the dump into her own personal hunting ground to engage in a nightmarish bloodsport... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the Spring of 1983, neither Ginny nor Nicolette knows the other exists. By the time Summer rolls around, one of them will be dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;At this, the Cailleach would release a single drop of indigo dye onto the topmost layer. See, she would tell her daughter. See? It bleeds through the topmost path and onto the next. In this way, so many things from the next world touch ours, and our world touches the layer beneath.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High above the sea, hidden in the rocky Scottish cliffs, something stirs. An ancient matriarchial power has set the wheels in motion for a long line of descendants. But to what end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning centuries of human history, these daughters of the lowland hag, the Cailleach, must navigate a world filled with superstition, hatred, violence, pestilence, and death to find their purpose. With pasts half remembered and destinies denied, the daughters of Cailleach are women with uncanny, and often feared, abilities to heal, to see the future and to cause great destruction and pain when threatened. With each passing generation, the waves crash against the shore, and the Cailleach awaits a homecoming that will bring everything full circle.</description>

  <description>A neglected 12-year-old boy does nothing to report the death of his mother in order to compete in a spelling bee. A tragic coming-of-age tale of horror and drama in the setting of a hot New Orleans summer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Original, touching coming of age." &lt;br /&gt; ~Jack Ketchum, author of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "With OF FOSTER HOMES &amp;amp; FLIES, Lutzke is firing on all cylinders. It's a lean mean emotional machine. Coming-of-age presented in a fresh direction. Bearing tremendous emotional weight and heart. It made me cry. " &lt;br /&gt; -John Boden, author of JEDI SUMMER and DOMINOES &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Disturbing, often gruesome, yet poignant at the same time, Chad Lutzke’s OF FOSTER HOMES AND FLIES is one of the best dark coming-of-age tales I’ve read in years. You’ll laugh (sometimes when you know you shouldn’t), you’ll cry, you’ll find yourself wondering how soon you can read more of this guy’s work. Highly recommended!” &lt;br /&gt; - James Newman, author of MIDNIGHT RAIN, UGLY AS SIN, and ODD MAN OUT &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"OF FOSTER HOMES AND FLIES by Chad Lutzke is a lovely addition to the coming of age subgenre. He creates in the character of Denny an authentic young man with passions and foibles, someone easy to relate to and root for. The novella hits all the right notes you expect out of a coming of age tale, while also providing a plot that has originality and surprises." &lt;br /&gt;~Mark Allan Gunnells, author of FLOWERS IN A DUMPSTER and THE SUMMER OF WINTERS &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bones Are Made to Be Broken presents fourteen stories from the intersection of pain and anxiety, rage and fear. On a Nevada highway, a vampire familiar loses faith. At the edge of known space, a man drives himself insane. A would-be mother hears the sounds of a child from another dimension. A piece of stained glass might be all that stands between us and the end of the world. Triumph and tragedy, terror and transformation, are realized in the stories of Bones Are Made to Be Broken. With an introduction by Damien Angelica Walters and an afterword by Bracken MacLeod.</description>

  <description>Infants are vanishing all over Waitangi, a small island nestled in the Pacific Ocean. The local tribe believes a colossal albatross is responsible. Worse still, they are convinced that the seabird had been trained to carry out these sinister kidnappings. On the other side of the globe, in England, a troubled Maori girl falls in love with Aryan - a charismatic fire-breather. As their doomed relationship unfolds, a tragedy strikes, leaving her forever changed. Grieving, she travels to the island in desperate search of her estranged father and seeking answers to her shrouded origins. Will her actions influence the mysterious events occurring on the isle?</description>

  <description>A taut, psychological mind-bender from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don’t get visitors. Not out here. We never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Junior and Hen are a quiet married couple. They live a comfortable, solitary life on their farm, far from the city lights, but in close quarters with each other. One day, a stranger from the city arrives with surprising news: Junior has been randomly selected to travel far away from the farm...very far away. The most unusual part? Arrangements have already been made so that when he leaves, Hen won’t have a chance to miss him at all, because she won’t be left alone—not even for a moment. Hen will have company. Familiar company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Foe&lt;/i&gt; examines the nature of domestic relationships, self-determination, and what it means to be (or not to be) a person. An eerily entrancing page-turner, it churns with unease and suspense from the first words to its shocking finale.</description>

  <description>From the earliest depictions of winged goddesses to the delicate, paperwinged fairies of the Victorians, from valiant Valkyries to cliff-dwelling harpies, from record-setting pilots to fearless astronauts, women have long since claimed their place in the skies, among the clouds and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word Horde presents Fright Into Flight, the debut anthology from Amber Fallon (The Terminal, The Warblers), in which women take wing. In these stories connected by the unifying thread of flight, authors including Damien Angelica Walters, Christine Morgan, and Nadia Bulkin have spread their wings and created terrifying visions of real life angels, mystical journeys, and the demons that lurk inside us all. Whether you like your horror quiet and chilling or more in-your-face and terrifying, there’s something here for every horror fan to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re in for a bumpy ride… So fasten your seatbelt, take note of the emergency exits, hold on to your airsick bag, and remember that this book may be used as a flotation device in the event of a crash landing.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Three students: dead. &lt;br /&gt;Carly Johnson: vanished without a trace. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two decades have passed since an inferno swept through Elmbridge High, claiming the lives of three teenagers and causing one student, Carly Johnson, to disappear. The main suspect: Kaitlyn, "the girl of nowhere." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn's diary, discovered in the ruins of Elmbridge High, reveals the thoughts of a disturbed mind. Its charred pages tell a sinister version of events that took place that tragic night, and the girl of nowhere is caught in the center of it all. But many claim Kaitlyn doesn't exist, and in a way, she doesn't - because she is the alter ego of Carly Johnson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carly gets the day. Kaitlyn has the night. It's during the night that a mystery surrounding the Dead House unravels and a dark, twisted magic ruins the lives of each student that dares touch it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut author Dawn Kurtagich masterfully weaves together a thrilling and terrifying story using psychiatric reports, witness testimonials, video footage, and the discovered diary - and as the mystery grows, the horrifying truth about what happened that night unfolds.</description>

  <description>'Bones' brings together four chilling ghost stories by award winning writer-director Andrew Cull. Four monsters collected in paperback for the first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Did You Forget About Me?'&lt;br /&gt;"He had written to me a month or so before he died. I'd ignored the letter the same way I'd ignored all the others."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Cam Miller returns to the town he grew up in he's heading to clear his estranged father's farmhouse. He's also returning to the house he fled 23 years before. There, among the nicotine stained keepsakes and remnants of a broken life, he'll come face to face with a horror that has waited all those years for his return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's you he wants."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Hope and Walker'&lt;br /&gt;"We were both 10. But he was dead. And I sat drawing him."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em Walker is just like any other 10-year-old girl growing up in the small, outback town of Hope. That is, except for the fact that her Dad runs one of the town's two funeral parlours, and the dead have just started speaking to her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hope is rocked by a terrible crime, Em, stubborn, scared of spiders, and with a temper that's likely to get her into trouble, will find herself thrust into the middle of a dangerous hunt for the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Being scared's good," Grandpa Walker had told me once. "Stops us from doing stupid things." It hadn't stopped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The Trade'&lt;br /&gt;That summer should have been filled with laughter, with slip n' slides in the yard, lazy afternoons lying watching ice cream clouds swirling through the blue sky, melting in slow motion. I watched a plane rising high above our house. From the ground it looked completely still, as if it hung suspended in the air, a model on a string. I wished I was on it, I wished I could escape. I was seven and that was the summer death stalked our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began with the offerings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Knock and You Will See Me'&lt;br /&gt;"We buried Dad in the winter. It wasn't until the spring that we heard from him again." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When grieving Ellie Ray finds a crumpled, handwritten note from her recently deceased father, hidden behind the couch, she assumes that her middle boy, Max, left it there. It has a single word written on it: WHY. But, as more and more letters begin to appear throughout the house, Ellie and her three boys will find themselves dragged into a deeply sinister mystery surrounding her father's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dad? I looked down at the scribbled note in my hand, at the words torn into the paper. What had started as a whisper had grown louder, more desperate. The words had been screamed onto the page. Dad? Please. What's going on?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Bones' Four Stories. Four Monsters.</description>

  <description>In my family, we each have our own monster. They don’t always show their ugly faces to us. Sometimes we’ll have a day that is fine. Nice and quiet. Other days, one of us will see our monster peeking around a corner, its grin ghastly and wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would tell the story of how I saw my monster for the first time, but I don’t really remember it. As far as I know, I saw it the day I was born. It was in the eyes of my mother, in the freefall of my father, in the cold heart of my sister, in the emptiness of a family so scared, the very fabric under its feet was coming undone and letting every demon through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this isn’t the story of how I first saw my monster. This is the story of how I killed it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;CONGRATULATIONS! You've won a role on LET'S SWITCH HOUSES! Your life is going to change. We promise. Your dreams will come true. Everything you've ever wanted, we have it. This is a chance of a lifetime. Come inside. Switch with us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela and Terry return home after several grueling months of filming the popular television show, LET'S SWITCH HOUSES!, only to find their residence in ruin. Sure, the décor and framed photographs are the same; the color of the walls hasn't changed; the furniture sits unmoved. But something is off. Their quiet New Jersey home feels tainted. Angela can sense it. Crawling inside her. Infecting her mind. Poisoning her thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the nightmares begin. Awful, lucid visions that cause her to question her own reality. What happened at 44 Trenton Road while she was gone? Just what did she do, that bizarre woman who claims she can communicate with the beyond? Who is she exactly? Angela aims to find out, but the further she investigates, the deeper into madness she descends. How far will she travel before she loses the trail of clues? Or worse—before she loses her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SWITCH HOUSE is a short novel for fans of supernatural thrillers with a dark twist.</description>

  <description>HALCYON is the answer for all Americans who want to escape, but paradise isn't what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful island in the middle of Lake Ontario―a self-sustaining community made up of people who want to live without fear, crime, or greed. Halcyon is run by Valerie Kemp, aka Mother Moon, benevolent and altruistic on the outside, but hiding an unimaginable darkness inside. She has dedicated her life to the pursuit of Glam Moon, a place of eternal beauty and healing. And she believes the pathway there can only be found at the end of pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the heels of tragedy, Martin Lovegrove moves his family to Halcyon. A couple of months, he tells himself, to retreat from the chaos and grind. He soon begins to suspect there is something beneath Halcyon’s perfect veneer and sets out to discover the truth―however terrible it might be―behind the island and its mysterious founder, Mother Moon.</description>

  <description>When David Caine, a celebrated skeptic of the supernatural, is invited by an old friend to spend a month in “the most haunted house in Virginia,” he believes the case will be like any other. But the Alexander House is different. Built by a 1700s land baron to contain the madness and depravity of his eldest son, the house is plagued by shadows of the past and the lingering taint of bloodshed. David is haunted, as well. For twenty-two years ago, he turned away the woman he loved, and she took her life in sorrow. And David suspects she’s followed him to the Alexander House.</description>

  <description>These woods are dark and full of monsters… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1991, hell was unleashed upon Saint Christopher’s Summer Camp for Kids. The killers left behind piles of bodies and rivers of blood. Some say a family of inbred cannibals was responsible. A masked psychopath with a butcher's knife is another popular theory. Some still believe a camp counselor lost his mind and went crazy on everyone with an axe. But there’s also the mysterious, derelict factory that sits nearby, atop Kill Hill. A place where urban legends are manufactured, the grotesque and bizarre. &lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years later, the factory on Kill Hill is still said to be operational, but no one can get near it. It’s safely guarded along with the secrets within. But there are a few loose strings and hitman Frank Harmon has been sent to tie them up. His kill list is short, but the night is long and full of unspeakable horrors. With the help of a few college students on an impromptu camping adventure, Frank must contain the mess at Kill Hill before it spreads to the neighboring towns. Before it infects the entire country. Before it invades the entire world. &lt;br /&gt;From the fantastical, high-octane mind of Tim Meyer, author of Sharkwater Beach and In the House of Mirrors, comes his most frightening tale yet! Summer camp this year is at your own risk. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Fasten your seatbelts for an anthology of turbulent tales curated by Stephen King and Bev Vincent. This exciting new anthology, perfect for airport or airplane reading, includes an original introduction and story notes for each story by Stephen King, along with brand new stories from Stephen King and Joe Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Book:&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King hates to fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he and co-editor Bev Vincent would like to share this fear of flying with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Flight or Fright, an anthology about all the things that can go horribly wrong when you're suspended six miles in the air, hurtling through space at more than 500 mph and sealed up in a metal tube (like—gulp!—a coffin) with hundreds of strangers. All the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we'll bet you've never thought of before... but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring brand new stories by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as fourteen classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Dan Simmons, and many others, Flight or Fright is, as King says, "ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents... Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight."</description>

      <![CDATA[Stephen King is afraid of something that I’m not. He’s afraid of flying. Don’t get me wrong, I have a lot of funky little fears and phobias, it’s just that flying isn’t one of them. So I saw this new anthology, aptly titled, Flight or Fright and I saw it as a personal dare from the King himself!...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A short, irresistible, and bittersweet coming-of-age story in the vein of "Stranger Things" and "Stand by Me" about a group of misfit kids who spend an unforgettable summer investigating local ghost stories and urban legends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1980s Niagara Falls--a seedy but magical, slightly haunted place--Jake Baker spends most of his time with his uncle Calvin, a kind but eccentric enthusiast of occult artifacts and conspiracy theories. The summer Jake turns twelve, he befriends a pair of siblings new to town, and so Calvin decides to initiate them all into the "Saturday Night Ghost Club." But as the summer goes on, what begins as a seemingly lighthearted project may ultimately uncover more than any of its members had imagined. With the alternating warmth and sadness of the best coming-of-age stories, &lt;i&gt;The Saturday Night Ghost Club&lt;/i&gt; examines the haunting mutability of memory and storytelling, as well as the experiences that form the people we become.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Reddit horror sensation Dathan Auerbach delivers a devilishly dark novel about a young boy who goes missing, and the brother who won't stop looking for him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric disappeared when he was three years old. Ben looked away for only a second at the grocery store, but that was all it took. His brother was gone. Vanished right into the sticky air of the Florida Panhandle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you've got only a couple days to find a missing person. Forty-eight hours to conduct searches, knock on doors, and talk to witnesses. Two days to tear the world apart if there's any chance of putting yours back together. That's your window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That window closed five years ago, leaving Ben's life in ruins. He still looks for his brother. Still searches, while his stepmother sits and waits and whispers for Eric, refusing to leave the house that Ben's father can no longer afford. Now twenty and desperate for work, Ben takes a night stock job at the only place that will have him: the store that blinked Eric out of existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben can feel that there's something wrong there. With the people. With his boss. With the graffitied baler that shudders and moans and beckons. There's something wrong with the air itself. He knows he's in the right place now. That the store has much to tell him. So he keeps searching. Keeps looking for his baby brother, while missing the most important message of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That he should have &lt;i&gt;stopped&lt;/i&gt; looking.</description>

  <description>The night uncovers all we wish not to see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A troubled man enters a dusky park before sunset. A young woman follows, hidden in shadow. Both have returned to the park to take back something the past has stolen from them, to make right six long years of suffering, and to find justice or perhaps redemption—or maybe they'll settle for some old-fashioned revenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But something evil is alive and awake in those woods, creatures that care nothing for human motivations. They’re driven by their own insatiable need: a ravenous, bottomless hunger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The campgrounds are full tonight, and the creatures are starving. Before the night is over, they will feed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An unrelenting tale of terror from Jason Parent.</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1983, thirteen-year-old Cyndi and her three new-found friends Stacy, Zack, and Brad decide to sneak away from their summer camp in the middle of the night by rafting down the nearby rivers. After spending a tense night lost in the woods, the four teenagers stumble into a mysterious water park that appears to be completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, they are thrilled to have the rides all to themselves, at least until one of them disappears. Soon they discover that they are trapped in the park, and a dark figure is stalking them from the shadows, picking them off one by one. Once night falls, Cyndi will have to fight to escape the park, a masked maniac, and a living nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill River is a wild water park ride filled with blood, gore, and '80s nostalgia. Slasher fans rejoice, old-school horror is back!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You will be scared. But you won’t know why…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m thinking of ending things. Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It lingers. It’s always there. Always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake once said, “Sometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say anything, you can do anything, but you can’t fake a thought.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here’s what I’m thinking: I don’t want to be here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this deeply suspenseful and irresistibly unnerving debut novel, a man and his girlfriend are on their way to a secluded farm. When the two take an unexpected detour, she is left stranded in a deserted high school, wondering if there is any escape at all. What follows is a twisted unraveling that will haunt you long after the last page is turned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this smart, suspenseful, and intense literary thriller, debut novelist Iain Reid explores the depths of the human psyche, questioning consciousness, free will, the value of relationships, fear, and the limitations of solitude. Reminiscent of Jose Saramago’s early work, Michel Faber’s cult classic &lt;i&gt;Under the Skin&lt;/i&gt;, and Lionel Shriver’s &lt;i&gt;We Need to Talk about Kevin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/i&gt; is an edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, this novel pulls you in from the very first page…and never lets you go.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far would you be willing to go to save those you love? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain is a young woman trying to rebuild herself after years of drug addiction and abuse. Ten years ago, at age sixteen, she gave up her baby after the father, her first love, dies in Iraq. Now, three years clean and on the way to a job interview, Rain borrows a pair of reading glasses from an old lady on a Brooklyn train. The lenses are cracked and through the crack she catches a glimpse of a little boy running and screaming. The boy looks so much like Rain’s dead lover. Like their son must look now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain realizes that the glasses give her quick glimpses of her lost son, Dylan, who needs her to find him. Dylan is important to our damaged, hopeless world. But he’s in terrible trouble because evil creatures - the Shadow People - are trying to corrupt and destroy him. If Dylan dies, then hope dies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does a recovering junkie fight supernatural monsters? And how far will one woman go to save her lost son?</description>

  <description>In 1993, David Koresh predicted the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if he was right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyrus doesn't believe in David's predictions, and he's not interested in being part of a cult. But after the sudden death of his brother, his parents split up and his mom drags him to Waco, Texas against his will. At least he's not alone. His friends, Marshal and Rachel, have equally sad stories that end with them being dumped at the Branch Davidian Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they're the trinity of nonbelievers, atheist teens caught between a soon to be infamous cult leader, an erratic FBI, and an epidemic that may confirm the worst of the church's apocalyptic prophecies. With tanks surrounding the Branch Davidians and tear gas in the air, Cyrus and his friends know one thing for certain: They can't count on the adults to save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his debut novel, Jerry Gordon takes readers deep inside the longest standoff in law enforcement history for an apocalyptic thriller that challenges the news media's reporting of the event, the wisdom of militarizing domestic law enforcement, and the blurry line between religion and cult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The things we do to each other are more awful than any haunted house, ghoul, or demon could ever be, and in BREAKING THE WORLD, Jerry Gordon delivers an unflinching look at real-life horror. This novel will gnaw its way through your skull, burrow into your brain, and mess with you in the best way possible. It’s a pitch-black tale of moral ambiguity, with sympathetic characters facing a home-grown apocalypse of twisted faith, fire, and madness. It’s one of the strongest horror debuts in recent memory, which not only entertains but provides penetrating insight into a dark chapter of American history. This is horror done right."&lt;br /&gt;– Tim Waggoner, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of LIKE DEATH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absorbing blend of history and narrative fiction which elevates the Waco tragedy into an unforgettable exploration of society, faith, and truth. BREAKING THE WORLD by Jerry Gordon is a compelling novel that thunders, and challenges, from page one. The characters are genuine, the struggles throughout are powerful, balanced, and thoughtful. The novel’s conclusion and Gordon’s ideas within do what great fiction often hopes to – defies and then transcends what we thought we knew.&lt;br /&gt;– Geoffrey Girard, Bram Stoker-nominated author of PROJECT CAIN and TRUTHERS</description>

  <description>Chicago is gripped by terror. The Sweet Sixteen Killer is brutally murdering young women, and the authorities are baffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the police are called to an affluent home in the middle of the night, they learn that a seemingly normal fourteen-year-old boy has attacked his family. The boy exhibits signs of demonic possession, and even more troublingly, he knows too much about the Sweet Sixteen killings. Father Jason Crowder, a young priest assigned to the case, must marshal his courage in order to save the boy and the entire city from the forces of evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a darkness mankind has never encountered before. It craves more than blood. And it won’t rest until it possesses Father Crowder’s soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This volume brings together the original novella that started it all—Exorcist Road—and an all-new full-length novel (Exorcist Falls) for a shattering experience in supernatural terror.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a manor by the sea, twelve sisters are cursed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annaleigh lives a sheltered life at Highmoor, a manor by the sea, with her sisters, their father, and stepmother. Once they were twelve, but loneliness fills the grand halls now that four of the girls' lives have been cut short. Each death was more tragic than the last—the plague, a plummeting fall, a drowning, a slippery plunge—and there are whispers throughout the surrounding villages that the family is cursed by the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbed by a series of ghostly visions, Annaleigh becomes increasingly suspicious that the deaths were no accidents. Her sisters have been sneaking out every night to attend glittering balls, dancing until dawn in silk gowns and shimmering slippers, and Annaleigh isn't sure whether to try to stop them or to join their forbidden trysts. Because who—or what—are they really dancing with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Annaleigh's involvement with a mysterious stranger who has secrets of his own intensifies, it's a race to unravel the darkness that has fallen over her family—before it claims her next.</description>

  <description>Evil is invisible, and it is everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamsen Donner must be a witch. That is the only way to explain the series of misfortunes that have plagued the wagon train known as the Donner Party. Depleted rations, bitter quarrels, and the mysterious death of a little boy have driven the pioneers to the brink of madness. They cannot escape the feeling that someone--or something--is stalking them. Whether it was a curse from the beautiful Tamsen, the choice to follow a disastrous experimental route West, or just plain bad luck--the 90 men, women, and children of the Donner Party are at the brink of one of the deadliest and most disastrous western adventures in American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the ill-fated group struggles to survive in the treacherous mountain conditions--searing heat that turns the sand into bubbling stew; snows that freeze the oxen where they stand--evil begins to grow around them, and within them. As members of the party begin to disappear, they must ask themselves "What if there is something waiting in the mountains? Something disturbing and diseased...and very hungry?"</description>

  <description>"The good old days of teen suspense are here again!" - A. Bates, author of Party Line and Final Exam - aulinebates.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A delightfully twisted tale of suspense..." - John Peel, author of the Shockers series, and as Nicholas Adams, IOU and Santa Claws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS...OR ELSE! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SET OF keys jangled in my hand. The keys were my lifeline. One of them would be what saved the day. I held onto them as tightly as I could. I was being followed. The man running behind me was my stepdad, Morris Heyward. He was holding an axe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER THE DEATHS of his best friend and stepdad, seventeen-year-old Blake Thomas can't escape the memories of that night...the screams...the blood...the axe. Now, Blake suffers from social anxiety and making friends at his new home seems impossible. With his therapist's suggestion, Blake joins a social media site called The Reading Buddy. It is supposed to be a way for him to slowly step back into social relationships, and it doesn't take long for him to become online friends with someone known as Charley17. Recovery seems to be within reach, but once the school year starts, three local teens quickly pull Blake into their own circle, and soon it appears that Charley17 doesn't want to share his new friend with anybody else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reading Buddy is a Southern-set throwback to the teen horror and thriller novels from the 1990s and will keep you guessing until the very end!</description>

  <description>They’ve watched over the house for generations…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The move from New York to the decrepit Pennsylvania farmhouse is as bad as West Ridley thought it would be. His father’s crippling vertigo only seems to get worse, and even with his mother working herself to the bone, they’re out of money and options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa Abraham is a drunk bastard and the living embodiment of the long neglected farmhouse. He claims the place is haunted. Ghosts roam the hall at night and their muffled cries fill the silence of warm, summer nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the ceiling above West’s bed are the words WE SEE YOU. In a house plagued by death and mysterious visitations, West realizes something beyond the fiction of his favorite horror books has to be faced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark secrets are buried deep, and there are Guardians who want to keep it that way. No matter where they go or what they do, West and his family know one thing… they are always watching.</description>
