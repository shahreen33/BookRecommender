  &lt;strong&gt;AN INNOCENT GAME. A SHOCKING CRIME. A COMMUNITY FULL OF SECRETS.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapledon, 1989&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two little girls were out playing a game of dares. Only one returned home.&lt;br /&gt;The ten-year-old told police what she saw: village loner Bill ‘Creepy’ Cawley dragged her friend into his truck and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;No body was found, but her testimony sent Cawley to prison for murder. An open and shut case, the right man behind bars.&lt;br /&gt;The village could sleep safe once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna thought she had left Mapledon and her nightmares behind but a distraught phone call brings her back to face her past.&lt;br /&gt;30 years ago, someone lied. 30 years ago, the man convicted wasn’t the only guilty party.&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s out of prison and looking for revenge. The question is, who will he start with?&lt;/p&gt; </description>

  <description>Eleanor Segall's life was beginning. An aspiring actress and a family girl, she never though her future would be derailed by mental illness. After a spate of depressive and manic episodes, panic attacks and social anxiety, Eleanor found herself in The Priory at age 16. The diagnosis? Bipolar I disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Eleanor didn't let it stop her for long. Now a successful blogger, journalist, and pillar of the mental health and Jewish communities, she writes about finding recovery and hope after being unwell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her story of picking herself back up again and surviving against the odds will resonate with many – and it can help you find that light in the darkness too.</description>

  <description>Dr Amanda Brown has treated inmates in the UK’s most infamous prisons – first in young offenders’ institutions, then at the notorious Wormwood Scrubs and finally at Europe’s largest women-only prison in Europe, Bronzefield. From miraculous pregnancies to dirty protests, and from violent attacks on prisoners to heartbreaking acts of self-harm, she has witnessed it all. In this memoir, Amanda reveals the stories, the patients and the cases that have shaped a career helping those most of us would rather forget.</description>

The line between a life of luxury and an existence of poverty can be determined by the stroke of midnight.&lt;br /&gt;When a series of uniquely brutal murders targets victims of totally different signs, is it a misguided revolution or the work of a serial killer?&lt;br /&gt;All eyes are on Detective Jerome Burton and Profiler Lindi Childs. They may disagree over whether the answers are written in the stars, but they are united by their belief that a grand plan is being executed...</description>

  <description>Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.</description>

  <description>A cursed girl escapes death and finds herself in a magical world - but is then tested beyond her wildest imagination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morrigan Crow is cursed. Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she's blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks--and, worst of all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Morrigan awaits her fate, a strange and remarkable man named Jupiter North appears. Chased by black-smoke hounds and shadowy hunters on horseback, he whisks her away into the safety of a secret, magical city called Nevermoor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's then that Morrigan discovers Jupiter has chosen her to contend for a place in the city's most prestigious organization: the Wundrous Society. In order to join, she must compete in four difficult and dangerous trials against hundreds of other children, each boasting an extraordinary talent that sets them apart - an extraordinary talent that Morrigan insists she does not have. To stay in the safety of Nevermoor for good, Morrigan will need to find a way to pass the tests - or she'll have to leave the city to confront her deadly fate.</description>

  <description>Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place-he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade. Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other. &lt;br /&gt;This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed Coraline. Like Coraline, this book is sure to enchant and surprise young readers as well as Neil Gaiman's legion of adult fans.</description>

  <description>An almost deserted town in the middle of nowhere, Nebulah's days of mining and farming prosperity - if they ever truly existed - are long gone. These days even the name on the road sign into town has been removed. Yet for Pete, an ex-policeman, Milly, Li and a small band of others, it's the only place they have ever felt at home. One winter solstice, a strange residual and mysterious mist arrives, that makes even birds disappear. It is a real and potent force, yet also strangely emblematic of the complacency and unease that afflicts so many of our small towns, and the country that Murphy knows so well. Partly inspired by the true story of Wittenoom, the ill-fated West Australia asbestos town, Soon is the story of the death of a haunted town, and the plight of the people who either won't, or simply can't, abandon all they have ever had. With finely wrought characters and brilliant plotting, it is a taut and original novel, where the people we come to know, and those who are drawn to the town's intrigue, must ultimately fight for survival.</description>

  <description>Outside a peaceful town in central Maine, a monster is waiting. Cujo is a two-hundred-pound Saint Bernard, the best friend Brett Camber has ever had. One day Cujo chases a rabbit into a bolt-hole—a cave inhabited by sick bats. What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inexorably drawing in all the people around him makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has written.</description>

  <description>A teenage girl is found wandering the outskirts of Oxford, dazed and distressed. The story she tells is terrifying. Grabbed off the street, a plastic bag pulled over her face, then driven to an isolated location where she was subjected to what sounds like an assault. Yet she refuses to press charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Fawley investigates, but there's little he can do without the girl's co-operation. Is she hiding something, and if so, what? And why does Fawley keep getting the feeling he's seen a case like this before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then another girl disappears, and Adam no longer has a choice: he has to face up to his past. Because unless he does, this victim may not be coming back . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every Wednesday, like clockwork, the terror returns.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like an ordinary Wednesday, until the phone rings. A mysterious caller with a chilling threat. Journalist Alice Henderson hangs up, ready to dismiss it as a hoax against the newspaper. But the next Wednesday, the stalker makes another move—and it becomes clear that this is all about Alice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone wants her to suffer, but for what? Her articles have made her a popular local champion—could it be her past rather than her work that’s put her life in danger? Alice is determined not to give in to fear, but with the police investigation at a dead end, her boyfriend insists on hiring private investigator Matthew Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every Wednesday the warnings escalate, until it’s not only Alice but also her family in the stalker’s sights. As her tormentor closes in, can Alice uncover what she’s being punished for before the terrifying threats become an unthinkable reality?</description>

  <description> Joanne Haynes has a secret: that is not her real name. &lt;p&gt;And there’s more. Her flat’s not hers. Her cats aren't hers. Even her hair isn’t really hers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nor is she any of the other women she pretends to be. Not the bestselling romance novelist who gets her morning snack from the doughnut van on the seafront. Nor the pregnant woman in the dental surgery. Nor the chemo patient in the supermarket for whom the cashier feels ever so sorry. They're all just alibis.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only thing that’s real about Joanne is that nobody can know who she really is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But someone has got too close. It looks like her alibis have begun to run out….&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first in a nail-shredding new crime series. Fans of M.J. Arlidge will be gripped from start to finish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a remote Highland mountain, the body of Elaine Buxton is burning. All that will be left to identify the respected lawyer are her teeth and a fragment of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the concealed back room of a house in Edinburgh, the real Elaine Buxton screams into the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Inspector Luc Callanach has barely set foot in his new office when Elaine’s missing persons case is escalated to a murder investigation. Having left behind a promising career at Interpol, he’s eager to prove himself to his new team. But Edinburgh, he discovers, is a long way from Lyon, and Elaine’s killer has covered his tracks with meticulous care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before another successful woman is abducted from her doorstep, and Callanach finds himself in a race against the clock. Or so he believes ... The real fate of the women will prove more twisted than he could have ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Angela Marson, Mark Billingham and M. J. Aldridge will be gripped by this chilling journey into the mind of a troubled killer.</description>

  <description>In 1994 fledgling journalist Louis Theroux was given a one-off gig on Michael Moore's TV Nation, presenting a segment on apocalyptic religious sects. Gawky, socially awkward and totally unqualified, his first reaction to this exciting opportunity was panic. But he'd always been drawn to off-beat characters, so maybe his enthusiasm would carry the day. Or, you know, maybe it wouldn't...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gotta Get Theroux This, Louis takes the reader on a joyous journey through his life and unexpectedly successful career. Nervously accepting the BBC's offer of his own series, he went on to create an award-winning documentary style that has seen him immersed in worlds as diverse as racist US militias and secretive pro-wrestlers, the violent gangs of Johannesburg and extreme drinkers in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably his biggest challenge was corralling celebrities in his When Louis Met series, with Jimmy Savile proving most elusive. Blindsided when the revelations about Savile came to light, Louis was to reflect again on the nature of evil he had spent decades uncovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with wry observation, larger-than-life characters, and self-deprecating humour, this is Louis at his insightful and honest best.</description>

  <description>A teenage murder witness is drowned in a tub of apples... At a Hallowe'en party, Joyce—a hostile thirteen-year-old—boasts that she once witnessed a murder. When no-one believes her, she storms off home. But within hours her body is found, still in the house, drowned in an apple-bobbing tub. That night, Hercule Poirot is called in to find the 'evil presence'. But first he must establish whether he is looking for a murderer or a double-murderer...</description>

  <description>Michael was always taken by the idea of love, a deep longing for what he believed to be the purpose of life. His desire manifested itself in various ways: for his family, for his friends, and for Anjali, the girl he meets at college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as his love blossoms for her, it reveals something inside him. Vivid hallucinations take hold of him, the world shifting and blurring, and Michael no longer knows what is real and what is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A journey through the spiritual lands of his people, a brief moment of hospitalisation, and a diagnosis of bipolar all lead Michael to where he is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and Other Gods takes a man through his journey of love</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman is forced to question her own identity in this riveting and emotionally charged thriller by the blockbuster bestselling author of The Good Girl, Mary Kubica&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie Sloane is on the path to rebuilding her life after years of caring for her ailing mother. She rents a new apartment and applies for college. But when the college informs her that her social security number has raised a red flag, Jessie discovers a shocking detail that causes her to doubt everything she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding herself suddenly at the center of a bizarre mystery, Jessie tumbles down a rabbit hole, which is only exacerbated by grief and a relentless lack of sleep.

Jessie begins to see things until she can no longer tell the difference between what’s real and what she’s only imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, twenty years earlier and two hundred and fifty miles away, another woman’s split-second decision may hold the key to Jessie’s secret past. Has Jessie’s whole life been a lie or have her delusions gotten the best of her?</description>

  <description>Rachel Teller and her husband David appear happy, prosperous and fulfilled. The big house, the successful business . . . They have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, control, not love, fuels their relationship and David has no idea his wife indulges in drunken indiscretions. When Rachel kills a man in a hit and run, the meticulously maintained veneer over their life begins to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destroying all evidence of the accident, David insists they continue as normal. Rachel though is racked with guilt and as her behaviour becomes increasingly self-destructive she not only inflames David's darker side, but also uncovers her own long-suppressed memories of shame. Can Rachel confront her past and atone for her terrible crime? Not if her husband has anything to do with it . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A startling, dark and audacious novel set in and around the Brighton streets, The Liar's Chair will keep readers on the edge of their seats until the final page has been turned. A stunning psychological portrait of a woman in a toxic marriage, Rebecca Whitney's debut will show that sometimes the darkest shadow holds the truth you have been hiding from . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Perfect for fans of Louise Doughty's Apple Tree Yard*</description>

  <description>Amy has a normal life. That is, if you were to go by a definition of 'no immediate obvious indicators of peculiarity', and you didn't know her very well. She has good friends, a good job, a nice enough home. This normality, however, is precariously plastered on top of a different life. A life that is Amy's real life. The only one her brain will let her lead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thoughtful, revealing, chilling and always unputdownable, &lt;i&gt;Unnatural Causes&lt;/i&gt; is the true crime book of the year. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you liked &lt;i&gt;This is Going to Hurt, War Doctor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All That Remains&lt;/i&gt; you'll love this. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'One of the most fascinating books I have read in a long time. Engrossing, a haunting page-turner. A book I could not put down' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Times\&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DAILY MAIL &lt;/i&gt;100 BEST SUMMER BOOKS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_&lt;i&gt;_________&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd. A detective in his own right, he must solve the mystery of sudden and unexplained deaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has performed over 23,000 autopsies, including some of the most high-profile cases of recent times; the Hungerford Massacre, the Princess Diana inquiry, and 9/11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has faced serial killers, natural disaster, 'perfect murders' and freak accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His evidence has put killers behind bars, freed the innocent, and turned open-and-shut cases on their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet all this has come at a huge personal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unnatural Causes &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of not only the cases and bodies that have haunted him the most, but also how to live a life steeped in death. &lt;br /&gt;__________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'A deeply mesmerising memoir of forensic pathology. Human and fascinating' &lt;/b&gt;- Nigella Lawson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Gripping, grimly fascinating, and I suspect I'll read it at least twice' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Included in &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt; Books of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Puts the reader at his elbow as he wields the scalpel' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Fascinating, gruesome yet engrossing'&lt;/b&gt; Richard and Judy, &lt;i&gt;Daily Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Heart-wrenchingly honest' &lt;/b&gt;Professor Sue Black, author of &lt;i&gt;All That Remains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Fascinating, insightful, candid, compassionate' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Lexie loves her home. She feels safe and secure in it – and loved, thanks to her boyfriend Tom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recently, something’s not been quite right. A book out of place. A wardrobe door left open. A set of keys going missing…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom thinks Lexie’s going mad – but then, he’s away more often than he’s at home nowadays, so he wouldn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Lexie isn’t losing it. She knows there’s someone out there watching her. And, deep down, she knows there’s nothing she can do to make them stop…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The dead talk. To the right listener, they tell us all about themselves: where they came from, how they lived, how they died - and who killed them. Forensic scientists can use a corpse, the scene of a crime or a single hair to unlock the secrets of the past and allow justice to be done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling crime author Val McDermid will draw on interviews with top-level professionals to delve, in her own inimitable style, into the questions and mysteries that surround this fascinating science. How is evidence collected from a brutal crime scene? What happens at an autopsy? What techniques, from blood spatter and DNA analysis to entomology, do such experts use? How far can we trust forensic evidence? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at famous murder cases, as well as investigations into the living - sexual assaults, missing persons, mistaken identity - she will lay bare the secrets of forensics from the courts of seventeenth-century Europe through Jack the Ripper to the cutting-edge science of the modern day.</description>

  <description>Renowned social psychologist and creator of the "Stanford Prison Experiment," Philip Zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things, how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally, and what this says about the line separating good from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lucifer Effect&lt;/i&gt; explains how—and the myriad reasons why—we are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side.” Drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research, Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week, the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around.</description>

  <description>Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the "steam" that children with the "shining" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant "shining" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes "Doctor Sleep."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.</description>

  <description>The first scream came from the snowbound railwayman who felt the fangs ripping at his throat. The next month there was a scream of ecstatic agony from the woman attacked in her snug bedroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now scenes of unbelieving horror come each time the full moon shines on the isolated Maine town of Tarker Mills. No one knows who will be attacked next. But one thing is sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the moon grows fat, a paralyzing fear sweeps through Tarker Mills. For snarls that sound like human words can be heard whining through the wind. And all around are the footprints of a monster whose hunger cannot be sated... &lt;b&gt;Cycle of the Werewolf&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>You love your family. They make you feel safe. You trust them. Or do you…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fifteen-year-old Billy Wilkinson goes missing in the middle of the night, his mother, Claire Wilkinson, blames herself. She's not the only one. There isn't a single member of Billy's family that doesn't feel guilty. But the Wilkinson’s are so used to keeping secrets from one another that it isn't until six months later, after an appeal for information goes horribly wrong, that the truth begins to surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is sure of two things – that Billy is still alive and that her friends and family had nothing to do with his disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother's instinct is never wrong. Or is it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two girls are forced into the woods at gunpoint. One runs for her life. One is left behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years ago, Charlotte and Samantha Quinn's happy small-town family life was torn apart by a terrifying attack on their family home. It left their mother dead. It left their father—Pikeville's notorious defense attorney—devastated. And it left the family fractured beyond repair, consumed by secrets from that terrible night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years later, Charlotte has followed in her father's footsteps to become a lawyer herself—the ideal good daughter. But when violence comes to Pikeville again, and a shocking tragedy leaves the whole town traumatized, Charlotte is plunged into a nightmare. Not only is she the first witness on the scene, but it's a case that unleashes the terrible memories she's spent so long trying to suppress--because the shocking truth about the crime that destroyed her family nearly thirty years ago won't stay buried forever. Packed with twists and turns, brimming with emotion and heart, &lt;i&gt;The Good Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is fiction at its most thrilling.</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>Adèle appears to have the perfect life: She is a successful journalist in Paris who lives in a beautiful apartment with her surgeon husband and their young son. But underneath the surface, she is bored--and consumed by an insatiable need for sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven less by pleasure than compulsion, Adèle organizes her day around her extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she's been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making. Suspenseful, erotic, and electrically charged, Adèle is a captivating exploration of addiction, sexuality, and one woman's quest to feel alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The new spine-tingling, sinister thriller from the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Chalk Man&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, Annie went missing. Disappeared from her own bed. There were searches, appeals. Everyone thought the worst. And then, miraculously, after forty-eight hours, she came back. But she couldn't, or wouldn't, say what had happened to her. Something happened to my sister. I can't explain what. I just know that when she came back, she wasn't the same. She wasn't my Annie. I didn't want to admit, even to myself, that sometimes I was scared to death of my own little sister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jess Aarons' greatest ambition is to be the fastest runner in his grade. He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits.</description>

      <![CDATA[Read this for a video- <br /><br />Unfortunately I did not like this as much I did as a child. The language surrounding weight would probably be deemed slightly problematic in todays society. I also thought the plot was a little weak and lacked the grit of some of her other books]]>

  <description>Frequently berated for breaking his hyper-fussy house rules, as well as for her lack of looks, confidence and friends, Beauty lives in uneasy fear whenever Dad’s home. Her pretty, sweet mum is equally afraid of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, after an unbearable birthday party, amidst fears that Dad’s temper is out of control, Mum and Beauty run away. They find themselves in an idyllic seaside resort where their new-found freedom and a moment of culinary inspiration give them a hobby, an income and even a new nickname for Beauty whose dreams all come true — and she deserves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I still love Jacquelines ability to talk about different subject matter e.g domestic abuse and bullying but in a way that is suitable for children. Loved rereading this!]]>

  <description>When Olivia Abbott moves to town, she's excited to join the cheerleading team and make new friends. Then she meets Ivy Vega. At first, Ivy, pale and dressed all in black, looks like Olivia's opposite. Then the girls look beyond the glittery pink blush and thick black eyeliner to discover they're identical--identical twins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia and Ivy are brimming with plans to switch places and pull every twin trick in the book. But Olivia soon discovers that she and Ivy aren't exactly the same. Ivy's a vampire. And she's not the only one in town.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE INSPIRATION FOR THE NEW NETFLIX SERIES DEBUTING THIS HALLOWE'EN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The best-known of Shirley Jackson's novels and a major inspiration for writers like Neil Gaiman and Stephen King, &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House &lt;/i&gt;is a chilling story of the power of fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four seekers have arrived at the rambling old pile known as Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of psychic phenomena; Theodora, his lovely assistant; Luke, the future inheritor of the estate; and Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman with a dark past. As they begin to cope with horrifying occurrences beyond their control or understanding, they cannot possibly know what lies ahead. For Hill House is gathering its powers - and soon it will choose one of them to make its own. Twice filmed as &lt;i&gt;The Haunting&lt;/i&gt;, and the inspiration for a new 10-part Netflix series, &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful work of slow-burning psychological horror.</description>

  <description>Christine wakes up every morning in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar man. She looks in the mirror and sees an unfamiliar, middle-aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades earlier decimated her ability to form new memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the truth, the more unbelievable it seems.</description>

  <description> The &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Teacher&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Truth or Die&lt;/em&gt; is back with a new twisty crime thriller &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;I’m alive. But I can’t be saved . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman’s body is found submerged in icy water, police are shocked to find she is alive. But she won’t disclose her name, or what happened to her – even when a second body is discovered. And then she disappears from her hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives Adrian Miles and Imogen Grey follow their only lead to the home of Reece Corrigan, and when his wife Angela walks in, they immediately recognise her. She’s the woman from the river, with her injuries carefully masked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more they dig into the couple, the less they understand about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have people in their past been hurt, or vanished?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why doesn’t Angela want to be saved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Smart, shocking and twisty – perfect for fans of Cara Hunter and Karin Slaughter.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;She was his.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;She was perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;And then, she was gone.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;If you liked &lt;em&gt;My Lovely Wife&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll love this.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice has always been haunted by the women from her husband’s past. As a politician and now a TV personality, George Bell’s reputation as a ladies’ man precedes him. But when Alice falls pregnant, her unease becomes an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one ex in particular she can’t get out of her head, a beautiful student who went missing before they finished university: Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Alice thinks she see Ruth on a train, she can’t shake the feeling there’s more to the disappearance than George has told her. But does she really want to know what her husband has been up to behind her back all these years?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code: little chalk stick figures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the same message, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;M.T. Edvardsson’s &lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping legal thriller that forces the reader to consider: How far would you go to protect the ones you love? In this twisted narrative of love and murder, a horrific crime makes a seemingly normal family question everything they thought they knew about their life—and one another.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Stella Sandell stands accused of the brutal murder of a man almost fifteen years her senior. She is an ordinary teenager from an upstanding local family. What reason could she have to know a shady businessman, let alone to kill him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella’s father, a pastor, and mother, a criminal defense attorney, find their moral compasses tested as they defend their daughter, while struggling to understand why she is a suspect. Told in an unusual three-part structure, &lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; asks the questions: How well do you know your own children? How far would you go to protect them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DON'T MISS THE BRAND-NEW THRILLER FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;EVERYTHING BUT THE TRUTH &lt;/i&gt;AND &lt;i&gt;ANYTHING YOU DO SAY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It's the day her father will be released from jail. Izzy English has every reason to feel conflicted - he's the man who gave her a childhood filled with happy memories.

  <description>Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin. But Winter isn't as weak as Levana believes her to be and she's been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters? Fans will not want to miss this thrilling conclusion to Marissa Meyer's national bestselling Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Alice and Jake are a picture-perfect couple. Alice, once a singer in a well-known rock band, is now a successful lawyer. Jake is a partner in an up-and-coming psychology practice. Their life together holds endless possibilities. After receiving an enticing wedding gift from one of Alice’s prominent clients, they decide to join an exclusive and mysterious group known only as The Pact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of The Pact seems simple: to keep marriages happy and intact, and most of its rules make sense: Always answer the phone when your spouse calls. Exchange thoughtful gifts monthly. Plan a trip together once per quarter. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mention The Pact to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice and Jake are initially seduced by the glamorous parties, the sense of community, their widening social circle of like-minded couples--and then one of them breaks the rules. The young lovers are about to discover that for adherents to The Pact, membership, like marriage, is for life, and The Pact will go to any lengths to enforce that rule. For Jake and Alice, the marriage of their dreams is about to become their worst nightmare.</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

  <description>An astonishingly incisive and suspenseful novel about a scandal amongst Britain's privileged elite and the women caught up in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie's husband James is a loving father, a handsome man, a charismatic and successful public figure. And yet he stands accused of a terrible crime. Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to rip them apart. Kate is the lawyer hired to prosecute the case: an experienced professional who knows that the law is all about winning the argument. And yet Kate seeks the truth at all times. She is certain James is guilty and is determined he will pay for his crimes. Who is right about James? Sophie or Kate? And is either of them informed by anything more than instinct and personal experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her privileged upbringing, Sophie is well aware that her beautiful life is not inviolable. She has known it since she and James were first lovers, at Oxford, and she witnessed how easily pleasure could tip into tragedy. Most people would prefer not to try to understand what passes between a man and a woman when they are alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in an elevator... Or alone in the moonlit courtyard of an Oxford college, where a girl once stood before a boy, heart pounding with excitement, then fear. Sophie never understood why her tutorial partner Holly left Oxford so abruptly. What would she think, if she knew the truth?</description>

  <description>Kate, Aubrey, and Jenny. They first met as college roommates and soon became inseparable, even though they are as different as three women can be. Twenty years later, one of them is standing at the edge of a bridge . . and someone else is urging her to jump. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did things come to this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel cuts back and forth between their college years and their adult years, you see the exact reasons why these women love and hate each other—but can feelings that strong lead to murder? Or will everyone assume, as is often the case, that it’s always the husband?</description>

  <description>The zoo is nearly empty as Joan and her four-year-old son soak up the last few moments of playtime. They are happy, and the day has been close to perfect. But what Joan sees as she hustles her son toward the exit gate minutes before closing time sends her sprinting back into the zoo, her child in her arms. And for the next three hours—the entire scope of the novel—she keeps on running.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joan’s intimate knowledge of her son and of the zoo itself—the hidden pathways and under-renovation exhibits, the best spots on the carousel and overstocked snack machines—is all that keeps them a step ahead of danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful thrill ride and an exploration of motherhood itself—from its tender moments of grace to its savage power—&lt;em&gt;Fierce Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; asks where the boundary is between our animal instinct to survive and our human duty to protect one another. For whom should a mother risk her life?</description>

  <description>Body-snatching has never been so heartwarming . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Humans&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, compulsively readable novel about alien abduction, mathematics, and that most interesting subject of all: ourselves. Combine Douglas Adams’s irreverent take on life, the universe, and everything with a genuinely moving love story, and you have some idea of the humor, originality, and poignancy of Matt Haig’s latest novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hero, Professor Andrew Martin, is dead before the book even begins. As it turns out, though, he wasn’t a very nice man--as the alien imposter who now occupies his body discovers. Sent to Earth to destroy evidence that Andrew had solved a major mathematical problem, the alien soon finds himself learning more about the professor, his family, and “the humans” than he ever expected. When he begins to fall for his own wife and son--who have no idea he’s not the real Andrew--the alien must choose between completing his mission and returning home or finding a new home right here on Earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When you're on a road trip, life is all about the detours. . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Curry is having a terrible year. Her mother has decided to move across the country and needs Amy to get their car from California to Connecticut. There's just one small problem: Since her father died this past spring, Amy hasn't been able to get behind the wheel. Enter Roger, the nineteen-year-old son of an old family friend, who turns out to be unexpectedly cute ... and dealing with some baggage of his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting new people and coming to terms with her father's death were not what Amy had planned on this trip. And traveling the Loneliest Road in America, seeing the Colorado mountains, crossing the Kansas plains, and visiting diners, dingy motels, and Graceland were definitely not on the itinerary. But as they drive, Amy finds that the people you least expected are the ones you may need the most—and that sometimes you have to get lost in order to find your way home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>The 50 contestants in the Miss Teen Dream pageant thought this was going to be a fun trip to the beach, where they could parade in their state-appropriate costumes and compete in front of the cameras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sadly, their airplane had another idea, crashing on a desert island and leaving the survivors stranded with little food, little water, and practically no eyeliner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s a beauty queen to do? Continue to practice for the talent portion of the program - or wrestle snakes to the ground? Get a perfect tan - or learn to run wild? And what should happen when the sexy pirates show up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the heart of non-exfoliated darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0375869026 (ISBN13: 9780375869020)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;i&gt; comes another page-turning look inside one family’s past as buried secrets threaten to come to light. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you let in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Family Upstairs, the master of “bone-chilling suspense” (People) brings us the can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Finely observed beautifully written” Daily Mail on The Secrets of Life and Death&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archaeologist Sage Westfield has her first forensics case: investigating the murder of a teenage girl. Hidden by holly leaves, the girl’s body has been discovered on the grounds of a stately home, where another teenage girl went missing twenty years ago - but her body was never found. With mysterious links between the two disappearances, the police suspect the reclusive owner, Alistair Chorleigh, who was questioned twenty years ago but never charged. But when Sage investigates a nearby burial mound - and uncovers rumours of an ancient curse - she discovers the story of Edwin Masters, his friend Peter Chorleigh, and an excavation over a hundred years ago, that also ended in a mysterious disappearance. Still recovering from the traumatic events of her recent past, Sage will need both her modern forensics skills and her historical archaeological knowledge to unearth the devastating truth.</description>

You’re keen to find a place of your own. But for now, you’re living with your big brother, camped out in his spare bedroom. And then – quite unexpectedly – you meet the man next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s the head teacher of the local high school. He’s twice your age. And he’s devastatingly attractive. Soon you find you’re watching him. All the time. But what you don’t know is that someone is watching you.

  <description>It was Sloane who yanked Emily out of her shell and made life 100% interesting. But right before what should have been the most epic summer, Sloane just…disappears. All she leaves behind is a to-do list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it, thirteen Sloane-inspired tasks that Emily would normally never try. But what if they could bring her best friend back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apple picking at night?&lt;/i&gt; Okay, easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dance until dawn?&lt;/i&gt; Sure. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiss a stranger?&lt;/i&gt; Um... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily now has this unexpected summer, and the help of Frank Porter (&lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; unexpected), to check things off Sloane's list. Who knows what she’ll find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Go skinny-dipping?&lt;/i&gt; Wait...what?</description>

  <description>For eighteen years the Hartes and the Golds have lived next door to each other, sharing everything from Chinese food to chicken pox to carpool duty—they've grown so close it seems they have always been a part of each other's lives. Parents and children alike have been best friends, so it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. They've been soul mates since they were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the appalling truth: Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head. There's a single unspent bullet in the gun that Chris took from his father's cabinet—a bullet that Chris tells police he intended for himself. But a local detective has doubts about the suicide pact that Chris has described.</description>

  <description>When the National Security Agency's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage... not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Poisonwood Bible&lt;/i&gt; is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it -- from garden seeds to Scripture -- is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.</description>

  <description>On the afternoon of October 12, 1990, my twin brother, Thomas, entered the Three Rivers, Connecticut, public library, retreated to one of the rear study carrels, and prayed to God the sacrifice he was about to commit would be deemed acceptable. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most acclaimed novels of our time, Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True is a story of alienation and connection, devastation and renewal, at once joyous, heartbreaking, poignant, mystical, and powerfully, profoundly human.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sherri Smith illuminates the dark side of the self-care and wellness industry in a thrilling ride of revenge perfect for fans of Liane Moriarty's &lt;i&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Retreat &lt;/i&gt;is a twisting, bone-chilling suspense that asks: how well do you really know your friends? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four women.&lt;br /&gt;Four secrets.&lt;br /&gt;A weekend that will change them forever...if they survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Manning was a beloved child star until her mid-teens when her manager attacked and permanently scarred her face, effectively ending her career and sending her on a path of all-too-familiar post-Hollywood self-destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now twenty-seven, Katie wants a better answer to those clickbait "Where Are They Now?" articles that float around online. An answer she hopes to find when her brother's too-good-to-be-true fianc�e invites her to a wellness retreat upstate. Together with Katie's two best friends--one struggling with crippling debt and family obligations, one running away from a failed job and relationship--Katie will try to find the inner peace promised at the tranquil retreat. But finding oneself just might drudge up more memories than Katie is prepared to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each woman has come to the retreat for different reasons. Each has her secrets to hide. And at the end of this weekend, only one will be left standing.</description>

  <description>A canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the "psychic" visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan's terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan's teenage stepson, doesn't help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Grownup,” originally appeared as “What Do You Do?” in George R. R. Martin’s Rogues anthology.</description>

  <description>My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise, I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cap mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead...</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A single text changed her life. Did it end his?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Latimer is furious. Her boss Andrew is being &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; unreasonable, as always. She fires off a text to her boyfriend, only in her haste she sends it to her whole office group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In it she says Andrew's being difficult about letting her have time off work. That she is angry. That she hopes he dies. The next day her face burns in the office. No one believes her when she says it was a typo, she meant to say does. She hopes he &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a nightmare. But it gets worse - Andrew doesn't turn up for work. And then the police come knocking. Because Andrew Burton has been murdered . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For some kids summer is a sun-soaked season of fun. But for Steve, it’s just another season of worries. Worries about his sick newborn baby brother who is fighting to survive, worries about his parents who are struggling to cope, even worries about the wasp’s nest looming ominously from the eaves. So when a mysterious wasp queen invades his dreams, offering to “fix” the baby, Steve thinks his prayers have been answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he has to do is say “Yes.” But “yes” is a powerful word. It is also a dangerous one. And once it is uttered, can it be taken back?</description>

  <description>For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question What makes a life worth living?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student "possessed," as he wrote, "by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. "I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything," he wrote. "Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.</description>

  <description>Storm, shipwreck, survival. Chris Vick's novel delves deep into the might and majesty of the unpredictable ocean, the strength of an unlikely friendship between a British boy and a Berber girl and their will to survive against all the odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young British boy called Bill narrowly survives the sinking of his yacht in a huge storm off the coast of Morocco.

As hope of rescue begins to fade, from Aya's tales of magic, brave heroes, wily thieves, greedy kings and cruel sultans, they find the strength they need to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they land on a desert island they're confronted by a strange young man who is not what he seems... and back out on the waves once more in the dark deep, a shadow follows and waits...</description>

  <description>A remote lodge in upstate New York is the perfect getaway. . . until the bodies start piling up.It's winter in the Catskills and the weather outside is frightful. But Mitchell's Inn is so delightful! The cozy lodge nestled deep in the woods is perfect for a relaxing--maybe even romantic--weekend away. The Inn boasts spacious old rooms with huge wood-burning fireplaces, a well-stocked wine cellar, and opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or just curling up with a book and someone you love. So when the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in for the long haul. The power's down but they've got candles, blankets, and wood--a genuine rustic experience! Soon, though, a body turns up--surely an accident. When a second body appears, they start to panic. Then they find a third body. Within the snowed-in paradise, something--or someone--is picking off the guests one by one. They can't leave, and with no cell service, there's no prospect of getting the police in until the weather loosens its icy grip. The weekend getaway has turned deadly. For some couples, it's their first time away. For others, it will be their last. And there's nothing they can do about it but huddle down and hope they can survive the storm.</description>

  <description>If the conscious mind—the part you consider you—accounts for only a tiny fraction of the brain’s function, what is all the rest doing? This is the question that David Eagleman—renowned neuroscientist and acclaimed author of Sum—answers in a book as accessible and entertaining as it is deeply informed by startling, up-to-the-minute research.</description>

      <![CDATA[I've read and loved two of Claire Douglas's other books, so I really had high expectations for this one but I was quite disappointed by it.<br /><br />For this book was just 360 pages of people arguing... which wasn't fun to read <br /><br />I felt like this really dragged. It was incredibly borning and dull...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Linzi Birrell and Rhian Douglas: murdered.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Angela McCabe and Josh Norbury: murdered.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A killer the police have dubbed Billy Dead Mates is killing pairs of best friends, one by one. Just before each murder, he sends his victim a small white book...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three regional police forces are working together to identify and catch Billy. For five months, they've been failing. Then a fifth victim, scared by what she's seen and heard on the news, comes forward to seek help. Unlike Billy's first four victims, she isn't dead. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand-up comedian Kim Tribbeck has one of Billy's peculiar white books. A stranger gave it to her after a gig she did a year ago. Was he Billy? Now Kim's life depends on working out why she - a woman who has no close friends because she trusts no one - should attract the attention of the Best Friends Killer... And, if Billy has her in his sights, why has he waited so long to strike?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Her name was Rose. You watched her die. And her death has created a vacancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emily lets a stranger step out in front of her, she never imagines that split second will change her life. But after Emily watches a car plough into the young mother – killing her instantly – she finds herself unable to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she makes a decision she can never take back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Rose had everything Emily had ever dreamed of. A beautiful, loving family, a great job and a stunning home. And now Rose’s husband misses his wife, and their son needs a mother. Why couldn’t Emily fill that space?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Emily is about to discover, no one’s life is perfect … and not everything is as it seems.</description>

  <description>Detective Esa Khattak is in the midst of his evening prayers when he receives a phone call asking that he and his partner, Detective Rachel Getty, look into the death of a local man who has fallen off a cliff. At first Christopher Drayton’s death—which looks like an accident—doesn’t seem to warrant a police investigation, especially not from Khattak and Rachel’s team, which handles minority-sensitive cases. But it soon comes to light that Drayton might have been living under an assumed name, and he may not have been the upstanding Canadian citizen he appeared to be. In fact, he may have been a Bosnian war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995. And if that’s true, any number of people could have had reason to help him to his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rachel and Khattak dig deeper into the life and death of Christopher Drayton, every question seems to lead only to more questions, and there are no easy answers. Did the specters of Srebrenica return to haunt Drayton at last, or had he been keeping secrets of an entirely different nature? Or, after all, did a man just fall to his death in a tragic accident?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her spellbinding debut, &lt;i&gt;The Unquiet Dead&lt;/i&gt;, Ausma Zehanat Khan has written a complex and provocative story of loss, redemption, and the cost of justice that will linger with readers long after turning the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Spine-tingling, chilling, and utterly compulsive, YOU LET ME IN is the stunning new novel from Richard &amp;amp; Judy Book Club author, Lucy Clarke&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing has felt right since Elle rented out her house . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I’M IN YOUR HOUSE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a new coldness. A shift in the atmosphere. The prickling feeling that someone is watching her every move from the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I’M IN YOUR HEAD&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s all in Elle’s mind? She’s a writer – her imagination, after all, is her strength. And yet every threat seems personal. As if someone has discovered the secrets that keep her awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;AND NOW I KNOW YOUR SECRET&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fear and paranoia close in, Elle’s own home becomes a prison. Someone is unlocking her past – and she’s given them the key…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>Kay Donovan may have skeletons in her closet, but the past is past, and she's reinvented herself entirely. Now she's a star soccer player whose group of gorgeous friends run their private school with effortless popularity and acerbic wit. But when a girl's body is found in the lake, Kay's carefully constructed life begins to topple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dead girl has left Kay a computer-coded scavenger hunt, which, as it unravels, begins to implicate suspect after suspect, until Kay herself is in the crosshairs of a murder investigation. But if Kay's finally backed into a corner, she'll do what it takes to survive. Because at Bates Academy, the truth is something you make...not something that happened.</description>

  <description>How far would you go to find your missing sister? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When DI Thomasine Albright is informed that the remains of her fifteen-year-old sister have been found, she has the tragic responsibility of breaking the news to her mother. Thomasine promises her mother that she will be the one to find Karen’s killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Karen Albright wasn’t the only girl to go missing during that weekend in 1973... Veronica Lightfoot disappeared too. They’d lived barely four miles apart, yet apparently never met. Suddenly there is a new question, was Veronica involved in Karen’s death? Is that why she vanished? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Mel Philips is handed the original case file and begins a new investigation. Unwilling to be side-lined, Thomasine decides to go it alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the case unfolds, Thomasine realises that there may be other victims. Can she find them too?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;What She Knew&lt;/em&gt; conjures a dark and unpredictable tale of family secrets that explores the lengths people will go to hurt one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her beloved nanny, Hannah, left without a trace in the summer of 1988, seven-year-old Jocelyn Holt was devastated. Haunted by the loss, Jo grew up bitter and distant, and eventually left her parents and Lake Hall, their faded aristocratic home, behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, Jo returns to the house and is forced to confront her troubled relationship with her mother. But when human remains are accidentally uncovered in a lake on the estate, Jo begins to question everything she thought she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an unexpected visitor knocks on the door and Jo’s world is destroyed again. Desperate to piece together the gaping holes in her memory, Jo must uncover who her nanny really was, why she left, and if she can trust her own mother…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compulsively readable tale of secrets, lies, and deception, Gilly Macmillan explores the darkest impulses and desires of the human heart. Diabolically clever, &lt;em&gt;The Nanny&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that sometimes the truth hurts so much you’d rather hear the lie.</description>

  <description>It's 1999 and the internet is still a novelty. At a newspaper office, two colleagues, Beth and Jennifer, e-mail back and forth, discussing their lives in hilarious details, from love troubles to family dramas. And Lincoln, a shy IT guy responsible for monitoring e-mails, spends his hours reading every exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first their e-mails offer a welcome diversion, but the more he reads, the more he finds himself falling for one of them. By the time Lincoln realises just how head-over-heels he is, it's too late to introduce himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of close encounters, Lincoln eventually decides he must follow his heart... and find out if there is such a thing as love before first sight.</description>

  <description>Castle Rock is a small town, where word gets around quickly. That's why Scott Carey wants to confide only in his friend Doctor Bob Ellis about his strange condition: he's losing weight, without getting thinner, and the scales register the same when he is in his clothes or out of them, however heavy they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott also has new neighbours, who have opened a 'fine dining experience' in town, although it's an experience being shunned by the locals; Deirdre McComb and her wife Missy Donaldson don't exactly fit in with the community's expectations. And now Scott seems trapped in a feud with the couple over their dogs dropping their business on his lawn. Missy may be friendly, but Deirdre is cold as ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the town prepares for its annual Thanksgiving 12k run, Scott starts to understand the prejudices his neighbours face and he tries to help. Unlikely alliances form and the mystery of Scott's affliction brings out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From master storyteller Stephen King comes this compelling tale about finding common ground despite differences, a story with deep resonance for our time.</description>

  <description>There are no more cheerleaders in the town of Sunnybrook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First there was the car accident—two girls gone after hitting a tree on a rainy night. Not long after, the murders happened. Those two girls were killed by the man next door. The police shot him, so no one will ever know why he did it. Monica’s sister was the last cheerleader to die. After her suicide, Sunnybrook High disbanded the cheer squad. No one wanted to be reminded of the girls they lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was five years ago. Now the faculty and students at Sunnybrook High want to remember the lost cheerleaders. But for Monica, it’s not that easy. She just wants to forget. Only, Monica’s world is starting to unravel. There are the letters in her stepdad’s desk, an unearthed, years-old cell phone, a strange new friend at school. . . . Whatever happened five years ago isn’t over. Some people in town know more than they’re saying. And somehow Monica is at the center of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no more cheerleaders in Sunnybrook, but that doesn’t mean anyone else is safe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When you set out for revenge, dig two graves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in the sleepy English seaside town of Brynston, the fearless five – Ella, Max, Corey, Fallon and Zane – were always inseparable. Living up to their nickname, they were the adventurous, rowdy kids who lived for ghost stories and exploring the nearby islands off the coast. But when Max’s beloved older sister Jessica is killed, the friendship seems to die with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now years later, only Max and Ella are in touch; still best friends and a couple since they were thirteen. Their lives are so intertwined Max’s dad even sponsors Ella’s training for the Commonwealth Games. But Ella is hiding things. Like why she hates going to Max’s house for Sunday dinner, and flinches whenever his family are near. Or the real reason she’s afraid to take their relationship to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When underdog Corey is bullied, the fearless five are brought back together again, teaming up to wreak havoc and revenge on those who have wronged them. But when the secrets they are keeping can no longer be kept quiet, will their fearlessness be enough to save them from themselves?</description>

  <description>A chilling collection of psychological suspense and literary horror from the multiple award-winning author of the national bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Cabin at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful anthology featuring nineteen pieces of short fiction, &lt;em&gt;Growing Things&lt;/em&gt; is an exciting glimpse into Paul Tremblay’s fantastically fertile imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “The Teacher,” a Bram Stoker Award nominee for best short story, a student is forced to watch a disturbing video that will haunt and torment her and her classmates’ lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four men rob a pawn shop at gunpoint only to vanish, one-by-one, as they speed away from the crime scene in “The Getaway.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “Swim Wants to Know If It’s as Bad as Swim Thinks,” a meth addict kidnaps her daughter from her estranged mother as their town is terrorized by a giant monster... or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining these haunting works are stories linked to Tremblay’s previous novels. The tour de force metafictional novella “Notes from the Dog Walkers” deconstructs horror and publishing, possibly bringing in a character from &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;, all while serving as a prequel to &lt;em&gt;Disappearance at Devil’s Rock.&lt;/em&gt; “The Thirteenth Temple” follows another character from &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;—Merry, who has published a tell-all memoir written years after the events of the novel. And the title story, “Growing Things,” a shivery tale loosely shared between the sisters in &lt;em&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts,&lt;/em&gt; is told here in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From global catastrophe to the demons inside our heads, Tremblay illuminates our primal fears and darkest dreams in startlingly original fiction that leaves us unmoored. As he lowers the sky and yanks the ground from beneath our feet, we are compelled to contemplate the darkness inside our own hearts and minds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Six were taken. Eleven years later, five come back&lt;/i&gt;--with no idea of where they've been.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven years ago, six kindergarteners went missing without a trace. After all that time, the people left behind moved on, or tried to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until today. Today five of those kids return. They're sixteen, and they are . . . fine. Scarlett comes home and finds a mom she barely recognizes, and doesn't really recognize the person she's supposed to be, either. But she thinks she remembers Lucas. Lucas remembers Scarlett, too, except they're entirely unable to recall where they've been or what happened to them. Neither of them remember the sixth victim, Max. He doesn't come back. Everyone wants answers. Most of all Max's sister Avery, who needs to find her brother--dead or alive--and isn't buying this whole memory-loss story.</description>

  <description>“You have to help me. We’re not being reformed. We’re being brainwashed.”&lt;p&gt;All sixteen year old Drew Finch wants is to be left alone. She's not interested in spending time with her mum and stepdad and when her disruptive fifteen year old brother Mason is expelled from school for the third time and sent to a residential reform academy she's almost relieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything changes when she's followed home from school by the mysterious Dr Cobey, who claims to have a message from Mason. There is something sinister about the ‘treatment’ he is undergoing. The school is changing people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to help her brother, Drew must infiltrate the Academy and unearth its deepest, darkest secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Before it’s too late.&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>On an island off the coast of Maine, a man is found dead. There's no identification on the body. Only the dogged work of a pair of local newspapermen and a graduate student in forensics turns up any clues. &lt;p&gt; But that's just the beginning of the mystery. Because the more they learn about the man and the baffling circumstances of his death, the less they understand. Was it an impossible crime? Or something stranger still...? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one but Stephen King could tell this story about the darkness at the heart of the unknown and our compulsion to investigate the unexplained. With echoes of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon and the work of Graham Greene, one of the world's great storytellers presents a surprising tale that explores the nature of mystery itself...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A family is shaken to its core after the mysterious disappearance of a teenage boy in this eerie tale, a blend of literary fiction, psychological suspense, and supernatural horror from the author of &lt;i&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late one summer night, Elizabeth Sanderson receives the devastating news that every mother fears: her fourteen-year-old son, Tommy, has vanished without a trace in the woods of a local park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search isn’t yielding any answers, and Elizabeth and her young daughter, Kate, struggle to comprehend his disappearance. Feeling helpless and alone, their sorrow is compounded by anger and frustration. The local and state police haven’t uncovered any leads. Josh and Luis, the friends who were with Tommy last, may not be telling the whole truth about that night in Borderland State Park, when they were supposedly hanging out at a landmark the local teens have renamed Devil’s Rock— rumored to be cursed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in an all-too-real nightmare, riddled with worry, pain, and guilt, Elizabeth is wholly unprepared for the strange series of events that follow. She believes a ghostly shadow of Tommy materializes in her bedroom, while Kate and other local residents claim to see a shadow peering through their own windows in the dead of night. Then, random pages torn from Tommy’s journal begin to mysteriously appear—entries that reveal an introverted teenager obsessed with the phantasmagoric; the loss of his father, killed in a drunk-driving accident a decade earlier; a folktale involving the devil and the woods of Borderland; and a horrific incident that Tommy believed connected them all and changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search grows more desperate, and the implications of what happened becomes more haunting and sinister, no one is prepared for the shocking truth about that night and Tommy’s disappearance at Devil’s Rock.</description>

  <description>Littleport, Maine is like two separate towns: a vacation paradise for wealthy holidaymakers and a simple harbour community for the residents who serve them. Friendships between locals and visitors are unheard of - but that's just what happened with Avery Greer and Sadie Loman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each summer for a decade the girls are inseparable - until Sadie is found dead. When the police rule the death a suicide, Avery can't help but feel there are those in the community, including a local detective and Sadie's brother Parker, who blame her. Someone knows more than they're saying, and Avery is intent on clearing her name before the facts get twisted against her.</description>

  <description>When his dad is caught embezzling funds from half the town, Rob goes from popular lacrosse player to social pariah. Even worse, his father’s failed suicide attempt leaves Rob and his mother responsible for his care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks of Maegan as a typical overachiever, but she has a secret of her own after the pressure got to her last year. And when her sister comes home from college pregnant, keeping it from her parents might be more than she can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rob and Maegan are paired together for a calculus project, they’re both reluctant to let anyone through the walls they’ve built. But when Maegan learns of Rob’s plan to fix the damage caused by his father, it could ruin more than their fragile new friendship...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This captivating, heartfelt novel asks the question: Is it okay to do something wrong for the right reasons?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Chilling near-future SF for fans of Black Mirror and True Detective.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lucie Sterling's daughter is abducted, she knows it'll be no easy feat to find answers. Stanton is no ordinary city: invasive digital technology has been banned, by public vote. No surveillance state, no shadowy companies holding databases of information on private citizens, no phones tracking their every move. Only one place stays firmly anchored in the bad old ways, in a huge bunker across town: Green Valley, where the inhabitants have retreated into the comfort of full-time virtual reality--personae non gratae to the outside world. And it's inside Green Valley, beyond the ideal virtual world it presents, that Lucie will have to go to find her missing daughter.</description>

  <description>All Stevie Bell wanted was to find the key to the Ellingham mystery, but instead she found her classmate dead. And while she solved that murder, the crimes of the past are still waiting in the dark. Just as Stevie feels she’s on the cusp of putting it together, her parents pull her out of Ellingham academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her own safety they say. She must move past this obsession with crime. Now that Stevie’s away from the school of topiaries and secret tunnels, and her strange and endearing friends, she begins to feel disconnected from the rest of the world. At least she won’t have to see David anymore. David, who she kissed. David, who lied to her about his identity—son of despised politician Edward King. Then King himself arrives at her house to offer a deal: He will bring Stevie back to Ellingham immediately. In return, she must play nice with David. King is in the midst of a campaign and can’t afford his son stirring up trouble. If Stevie’s at school, David will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tantalizing riddles behind the Ellingham murders are still waiting to be unraveled, and Stevie knows she’s so close. But the path to the truth has more twists and turns than she can imagine—and moving forward involves hurting someone she cares for. In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson’s second novel of the &lt;i&gt;Truly Devious&lt;/i&gt; series, nothing is free, and someone will pay for the truth with their life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a postapocalyptic take on the perennial classic "Little Red Riding Hood"...about a woman who isn't as defenseless as she seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not safe for anyone alone in the woods. There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse threats in the woods than the things that stalk their prey at night. Sometimes, there are men. Men with dark desires, weak wills, and evil intents. Men in uniform with classified information, deadly secrets, and unforgiving orders. And sometimes, just sometimes, there's something worse than all of the horrible people and vicious beasts combined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red doesn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she isn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she is a woman alone in the woods....</description>

  <description>How much do you know about the couple next door?&lt;p&gt;When Emily and Ben move in next door to Dr Burman and his wife Anita, they are keen to get to know their new neighbours. Outgoing and sociable, Emily tries to befriend the doctor’s wife, but Anita is strangely subdued, barely leaving the house, and terrified of answering the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Emily goes missing a few weeks later, Ben is plunged into a panic. His wife has left him a note, but can she really have abandoned him for another man? Or has Emily’s curiosity about the couple next door led her straight into danger?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Sparrow has always had a difficult time making friends. She would always rather stay home on the weekends with her mother, an affluent IT executive at a Manhattan bank, reading, or watching the birds, than play with other kids. And that's made school a lonely experience for her. It's made LIFE a lonely experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the one teacher who really understood her -- Mrs. Wexler, the school librarian, a woman who let her eat her lunch in the library office rather than hide in a bathroom stall, a woman who shared her passion for novels and knew just the ones she'd love -- is killed in a freak car accident, Sparrow's world unravels and she's found on the roof of her school in an apparent suicide attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of an insightful therapist, Sparrow finally reveals the truth of her inner life. And it's here that she discovers an outlet in rock &amp;amp; roll music...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world--where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe You Should Talk to Someone &lt;/i&gt;is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When two girls are abducted and killed in Missouri, journalist Camille Preaker is sent back to her home town to report on the crimes. Long-haunted by a childhood tragedy and estranged from her mother for years, Camille suddenly finds herself installed once again in her family's mansion, reacquainting herself with her distant mother and the half-sister she barely knows - a precocious 13-year-old who holds a disquieting grip on the town. As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.</description>

  <description>Please note: contains strong language and adult content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aunt Flo. The blob. Shark week. Whatever you call it, menstruation affects everyone. We all encounter periods to some extent in our lives, so it’s high time we talked about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There Will Be Blood does just that – it’s a chat show about periods. Whether menstruation is a mystery to you or you’ve come through the menopause, there will be something to learn and plenty to laugh at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two episodes, women’s health expert and author of Period Power, Maisie Hill, welcomes guests into the soundproofed safety of Audible’s studio to tackle long unanswered questions, lay myths to rest, and smash loads of taboos along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can expect explanations of vulvas, PMS and period pants; personal stories about period sex and leakage nightmares; and discussion of menstrual education and period poverty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you add There Will Be Blood to your library, you’ll get two episodes, each with a runtime of about 55 minutes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert—Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab—reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, &lt;i&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial and illuminating book.</description>

  <description>This is a story about the beautiful game - football, soccer. The highs, the lows, historic match days and foul play. It’s a celebration of a beloved player, a history maker, and his tragic ending at the final whistle. It’s a story about science and discovery, about the people on the front line of life-changing research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But above all it’s a story about family and about consequence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is wrapped up in three little letters: CTE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An investigative documentary from multi-award-winning producer Hana Walker-Brown [Audio Production Awards Best Documentary (Winner, 2017, 2016), Prix Europa (Nominee, 2018, 2017, 2015), Åke Blomström Prize (Winner, 2015) Hearsay International Audio Arts Award (Nominee, 2014) and Charles Parker Prize Gold Award (Winner, 2013)], The Beautiful Brain looks at the devastating effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a degenerative brain disease found in people who’ve suffered severe or repeated blows to the head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the story of FA Cup winner Jeff Astle, the audiobook expands outwards looking at the widows, daughters and families who are left fighting for answers following the death of their loved ones. As the documentary progresses, Hana’s investigation leads her from Britain’s football pitches to support groups for victims of domestic violence and beyond, sparking a vital discussion about accountability and the urgent need for further scientific studies into CTE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running time: 3 hrs and 42 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2019 Audible, Ltd (P)2019 Audible, Ltd</description>

  <description>A harrowing, remarkable poetry memoir about one girl's struggle with anxiety disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a true story of growing up, breaking down, and coming to grips with a psychological disorder. When Samantha Schutz first left home for college, she was excited by the possibilities -- freedom from parents, freedom from a boyfriend who was reckless with her affections, freedom from the person she was supposed to be. At first, she revelled in the independence. . . but as pressures increased, she began to suffer anxiety attacks that would leave her mentally shaken and physically incapacitated. Thus began a hard road of discovery and coping, powerfully rendered in this poetry memoir.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>Like many ambitious New York City teenagers, Craig Gilner sees entry into Manhattan's Executive Pre-Professional High School as the ticket to his future. Determined to succeed at life--which means getting into the right high school to get into the right college to get the right job--Craig studies night and day to ace the entrance exam, and does. That's when things start to get crazy.&lt;br /&gt;At his new school, Craig realizes that he isn't brilliant compared to the other kids; he's just average, and maybe not even that. He starts earning mediocre grades and sees his once-perfect future crumbling away. The stress becomes unbearable and Craig stops eating and sleeping--until, one night, he nearly kills himself. &lt;br /&gt;Craig's suicidal episode gets him checked into a mental hospital, where his new roommate is an Egyptian schoolteacher who refuses to get out of bed. His neighbors include a transsexual sex addict, a girl who has scarred her own face with scissors, and the self-elected President Armelio. There, isolated from the crushing pressures of school and friends, Craig is finally able to confront the sources of his anxiety. &lt;br /&gt;Ned Vizzini, who himself spent time in a psychiatric hospital, has created a remarkably moving tale about the sometimes unexpected road to happiness. For a novel about depression, it's definitely a funny story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Librarian note:&lt;/u&gt; Older cover edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46734006-girl-interrupted" rel="nofollow"&gt;9781860497926&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a "parallel universe" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl, Interrupted is a clear-sighted, unflinching documnet that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and recovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A good friend will bury your body, a best friend will dig you back up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dino doesn’t mind spending time with the dead. His parents own a funeral home, and death is literally the family business. He’s just not used to them talking back. Until Dino’s ex-best friend July dies suddenly—and then comes back to life. Except not exactly. Somehow July is not quite alive, and not quite dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dino and July attempt to figure out what’s happening, they must also confront why and how their friendship ended so badly, and what they have left to understand about themselves, each other, and all those grand mysteries of life.</description>

  <description>In 1998, a sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on school property, dressed in white and posed on a swing, with no known cause of death. The novel opens with this image, as related to us by the narrator, Violet, looking back on the night it happened from the present day, before returning to relate the series of events leading up to the girl’s murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an accident involving her Dad and sister, Violet joins Elm Hollow Academy, a private girls school in a quiet coastal town, which has an unpleasant history as the site of famous 17th century witch trials. Violet quickly finds herself invited to become the fourth member of an advanced study group, alongside Robin, Grace, and Alex - led by their charismatic art teacher, Annabel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Annabel claims her classes aren’t related to ancient rites and rituals - warning the girls off the topic, describing it as little more than mythology - the girls start to believe that magic is real, and that they can harness it. But when the body of a former member of the society - Robin’s best friend, with whom Violet shares an uncanny resemblance - is found dead on campus nine months after she disappeared, Violet begins to wonder whether she can trust her friends, teachers, or even herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Someone once told me that you have two families in your life - the one you are born into and the one you choose. Yes, you may get to choose your partner, but you don't choose your mother-in-law. The cackling mercenaries of fate determine it all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Lucy met Diana, she was kept at arm's length. Diana is exquisitely polite, but Lucy knows, even after marrying Oliver, that they'll never have the closeness she'd been hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who could fault Diana? She was a pillar of the community, an advocate for social justice, the matriarch of a loving family. Lucy had wanted so much to please her new mother-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was ten years ago. Now, Diana has been found dead, leaving a suicide note. But the autopsy reveals evidence of suffocation. And everyone in the family is hiding something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Family Next Door&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; comes a new page-turner about that trickiest of relationships.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; bestselling serial-killer thriller that will leave you wondering, is the past really in the past?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Chicago women have been found strangled, embalmed, and posed as if still alive. Doubting the findings of the local PD’s profiler, The FBI calls on forensic psychologist Zoe Bentley to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe quickly gets off on the wrong foot with her new partner, Special Agent Tatum Gray. Zoe’s a hunter, intense and focused; Tatum’s a smug maverick with little respect for the rules. Together, they must descend into a serial killer’s psyche and untangle his twisted fantasies, or more women will die. But when the contents of three inconspicuous envelopes reveal a chilling connection to gruesome murders from Zoe’s childhood, suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mother’s chance decision leads to a twist of fate that is every parent’s worst nightmare&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire Rawlings, mother of two and medical resident, will not let the troubling signs of an allergic reaction prevent her from making it in for rounds. But when Claire's symptoms overpower her while she's driving into work, her two children in tow, she must pull over. Moments later she wakes up on the floor of a gas station bathroom-her car, and her precious girls have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police have no leads and the weight of guilt presses down on Claire as each hour passes with no trace of her girls. All she has to hold on to are her strained marriage, a potentially unreliable witness who emerges days later, and the desperate but unquenchable belief that her daughters are out there somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Lovely Things&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a family shattered by an unthinkable tragedy. Played out in multiple narrative voices, the novel explores how the lives of those affected fatefully intersect, and highlights the potential catastrophe of the small decisions we make every day.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Armed with electric hair trimmers and a military fighting knife, Russell accepts his dark commission.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell Pisarek is twenty-six years old and still wets the bed. He grew up different from other young men because his vicious mother punished him for wetting by shaving his head. When he confided this to his girlfriend Tina, she betrayed him, advertising his problem to all their high school classmates, who turned on him mercilessly. He took out his frustration by skinning neighborhood cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Russell fantasizes about finding just the right woman—so he can shave her bald. He struggles to overcome his dark tendencies, but when his sister discovers he’s wetting again, she kicks him out of her house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time of stress, the mythical Piss Fairy appears in his dreams, and Russell is driven to satisfy his twisted desires with his innocent coworker Uma, who also needs a new roommate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his plans go awry, the Piss Fairy commissions him for a much darker task that graduates him from shaving to scalping—and worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: This novel depicts intense violence, hardcore horror, and disturbing psychological terror in the vein of such works as Jack Ketchum’s &lt;em&gt;The Girl Next Door&lt;/em&gt;, Cormac McCarthy’s &lt;em&gt;Child of God&lt;/em&gt;, Joyce Carol Oates’ &lt;em&gt;Zombie&lt;/em&gt;, and Jim Thompson’s &lt;em&gt;The Killer Inside Me&lt;/em&gt;. Although &lt;em&gt;The Bedwetter&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating in-depth character study into the mind and actions of a misogynistic and homophobic psychopath, the story events are vicious and brutal, the language coarse, and the approach to their reporting is cold and unflinching. This book is not for the faint of heart or those easily offended by language, sex, or violence. Read at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lee Allen Howard’s &lt;em&gt;The Bedwetter &lt;/em&gt;is an inventive psychological horror novel with a voice that’s as stylish as it is dark.” —Dustin LaValley, author of &lt;em&gt;The Deceived&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brutal, dark, compulsive read... stark, powerful, and satisfying” —Online Book Club&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Highly disturbing and electric.” —US Book Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The journey presented here is ugly, strange, revealing, and most of all, frightening. ... A deeply disturbing read.” —D. Donovan, Midwest Book Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lee Allen Howard is an imaginative writer with slick, vivid prose and high-octane pacing. He writes like no one else, and I mean this in a very good way.” —Trent Zelazny, author of &lt;em&gt;Too Late to Call Texas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In December 2017 the famous porn star August Ames committed suicide in a park in the Conejo Valley. It happened a day after she’d been the victim of a pile-on, via Twitter, by fellow porn professionals - punishment for her tweeting something deemed homophobic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, August’s husband, Kevin, connected with Jon Ronson to tell the story of how Twitter bullying killed his wife. What neither Kevin nor Ronson realized was that Ronson would soon hear rumors and secrets hinting at a very different story - something mysterious and unexpected and terrible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Last Days of August, Ronson unravels the never-before-told story of what caused this beloved 23-year-old actress’ untimely death.</description>

  <description>A chilling mosaic novel by masters of their craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a misty cemetery world, three strangers are drawn together through mysterious circumstances. Each of them has a tale to tell of a narrow escape from death. Amid the toll of funerary bells and the creep and click of mortuary-servitors, the truth is confessed. But whose story can be trusted? Whose recollection is warped, even unto themselves? For these are strange stories of the uncanny, the irrational and the spine-chillingly frightening, where horrors abound and the dark depths of the human psyche is unearthed.</description>

  <description>Harvey Anderson is a twenty-six-year-old street performer from New Jersey. He likes his peaceful life, but everything he knows is turned upside down when he is abducted and beaten by a group of nondescript thugs. Working for a sinister man known as "The Spider," these goons have spent the last nine years searching for Harvey’s girlfriend, Sally Starling. Now they think they know where she lives. And who she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one problem: Sally is gone and Harvey has no memory of her. Which doesn't make any sense, until The Spider explains that Sally has the unique ability to selectively erase a person’s memories. An ability she has used to delete herself from Harvey’s mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Harvey recovers from his beating, he discovers that Sally left him with one partial memory... a dancing girl in a blue dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life isn’t peaceful for Harvey anymore, and he soon finds himself in a war he can never win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or can he?</description>

  <description>What happens when we die? Is this really all there is? What exists beyond this life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Duncan is just an ordinary 14 year old boy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His main worries are homework, girls, the school bully...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and his sister, Jenna who has ovarian cancer, stage B. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his parents retreat into themselves, Alex is desperate to find a way to help, a way to make things better for his sister. After all, it’s the not knowing that’s the worst thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst he tries to untangle the ultimate question, life still goes on: his best friend seems oblivious to his feelings about her, the school bully has taken a special interest in him, and everything he does just makes him feel more and more awkward and out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Alex learns on his journey helps him to come to terms with not only his sister's mortality but also how he and his family and friends cope with that most compelling of questions: what lies beyond?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgia Springate’s debut novel, Beyond, is a touchingly compelling and uplifting coming-of-age story about love, loss and discovery. Get it today, and take an emotional journey through one boy’s quest to understand that most tricky of questions: what lies beyond this life?</description>

  <description>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man's disappearance throws four women's lives into chaos--who will survive?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki works as an aromatherapist, healing her clients out of her home studio with her special blends of essential oils. She's just finishing a session when the police arrive on her doorstep--her ex-husband David has gone missing. Vicki insists she last saw him years ago when they divorced, but the police clearly don't believe her. And her memory's hardly reliable--what if she &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have something to do with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Scarlet and her mother Zelda are down on their luck, and at eight years old, Scarlet's not old enough to know that the "game" her mother forces her to play is really just a twisted name for dealing drugs. Soon, Zelda is caught, and Scarlet is forced into years of foster care--an experience that will shape the rest of her life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David's new wife, Tanya, is the one who reported him missing, but what really happened on the night of David's disappearance? And how can Vicki prove her innocence, when she's not even sure of it herself? The answer lies in the connection among these four women--and the one person they can't escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her story is a phenomenon. Her life is a disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, she’s LadyConstellation, the anonymous creator of the wildly popular webcomic &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves the online one, and she has no desire to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Wallace Warland, &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;’s biggest fanfiction writer, transfers to her school. Wallace thinks Eliza is just another fan, and as he draws her out of her shell, she begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.</description>

  <description>Agatha Christie is more than the most popular mystery writer of all time. In a career that spans over half a century, her name is synonymous with brilliant deception, ingenious puzzles, and the surprise denouement. By virtually inventing the modern mystery novel she has earned her title as the Queen of Crime. Curious? Then you're invited to read....THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M-U-R-D-E-R. It began as an innocent parlor game intended to while away the hours on a bitter winter night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the message that appeared before the amateur occultists at the snowbound Sittaford House was spelled out as loud and clear as a scream. Of course, the notion that they had foretold doom was pure bunk. Wasn't it? And the discovery of a corpse was pure coincidence. Wasn't it? If they're to discover the answer to this baffling murder, perhaps they should play again. But a journey into the spirit world could prove terribly dangerous-especially when the killer is lurking in this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Branches and stones, daggers and bones,&lt;br /&gt;They locked the Beast away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of her sister, seventeen-year-old Violet Saunders finds herself dragged to Four Paths, New York. Violet may be a newcomer, but she soon learns her mother isn't: They belong to one of the revered founding families of the town, where stone bells hang above every doorway and danger lurks in the depths of the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin Hawthorne's bloodline has protected Four Paths for generations from the Gray—a lifeless dimension that imprisons a brutal monster. After Justin fails to inherit his family's powers, his mother is determined to keep this humiliation a secret. But Justin can't let go of the future he was promised and the town he swore to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Harper Carlisle lost her hand to an accident that left her stranded in the Gray for days, she has vowed revenge on the person who abandoned her: Justin Hawthorne. There are ripples of dissent in Four Paths, and Harper seizes an opportunity to take down the Hawthornes and change her destiny-to what extent, even she doesn't yet know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gray is growing stronger every day, and its victims are piling up. When Violet accidentally unleashes the monster, all three must band together with the other Founders to unearth the dark truths behind their families' abilities—before the Gray devours them all.</description>

  <description>A eclectic collection of gut wrenching tales to spook and scare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horror is no stranger to the worlds of Warhammer. Its very fabric is infested with the arcane, the strange and the downright terrifying.

Psychological torment, visceral horrors, harrowing tales of the supernatural and the nightmares buried within, this collection brings together some of the best horror writing from the Black Library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring stories from Graham McNeill, Cassandra Khaw, Alec Worley, David Annandale and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTENTS&lt;br /&gt;Nepenthe by Cassandra Khaw&lt;br /&gt;The Widow Tide by Richard Strachan&lt;br /&gt;No Good Deed by Graham McNeill&lt;br /&gt;Crimson Snow by Lora Gray&lt;br /&gt;Last of the Blood by C L Werner&lt;br /&gt;Predation of the Eagle by Peter McLean&lt;br /&gt;The Last Ascension of Dominic Seroff by David Annandale&lt;br /&gt;Triggers by Paul Kane&lt;br /&gt;A Darksome Place by Josh Reynolds&lt;br /&gt;The Marauder Lives by J.C.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this moving story two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within five feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. "A place" he said, "where learning is a game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.</description>

  <description>In 2008, twenty year-old Jonny Benjamin stood on Waterloo Bridge, about to jump. A stranger saw his distress and stopped to talk with him – a decision that saved Jonny's life. Fast forward to 2014 and Jonny, together with Rethink Mental Illness launch a campaign with a short video clip so that Jonny could finally thank that stranger who put him on the path to recovery. More than 319 million people around the world followed the search. ITV's breakfast shows picked up the story until the stranger, whose name is Neil Laybourn, was found and – in an emotional and touching moment – the pair re-united and have remained firm friends ever since. The Stranger on the Bridge is a memoir of the journey Jonny made both personally, and publicly to not only find the person who saved his life, but also to explore how he got to the bridge in the first place and how he continues to manage his diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Using extracts from diaries Jonny has been writing from the age of thirteen, this book is a deeply personal memoir with a unique insight on mental health. Jonny was recognised for his work as an influential activist changing the culture around mental health, when he was awarded an MBE in 2017. He and Neil now work full-time together visiting schools, hospitals, prisons and workplaces to help end the stigma by talking about mental health and suicide prevention. The pair ran the London Marathon together in 2017 in aid of HeadsTogether. Following the global campaign to find the stranger, in 2015 Channel 4 made a documentary of Jonny's search which has now been shown in 14 territories.</description>

  <description>Savannah is dreading being home alone with her overbearing mother after her sister goes off to college. But if she can just get through senior year, she'll be able to escape to college, too. What she doesn't count on is that her mother's obsession with weight has only grown deeper since her appearance on an extreme weight-loss show, and now Savvy's mom is pressuring her even harder to be constantly mindful of what she eats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between her mom's diet-helicoptering, missing her sister, and worrying about her collegiate future, Savvy has enough to worry about. And then she meets George, the cute new kid at school who has insecurities of his own. As Savvy and George grow closer, they help each other discover how to live in the moment and enjoy the here and now before it disappears.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;How can I hold myself together, when everything around me is falling apart?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neena's always been a good girl - great grades, parent-approved friends and absolutely no boyfriends. But ever since her brother Akash left her, she's been slowly falling apart - and uncovering a new version of herself who is freer, but altogether more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her wild behaviour spirals more and more out of control, Neena's grip on her sanity begins to weaken too. And when her parents announce not one but two life-changing bombshells, she finally reaches breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Neena is about to discover, when your life falls apart, only love can piece you back together.</description>

  <description>Sylvia Plath's shocking, realistic, and intensely emotional novel about a woman falling into the grip of insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther Greenwood is brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. In her acclaimed and enduring masterwork, Sylvia Plath brilliantly draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that her insanity becomes palpably real, even rational—as accessible an experience as going to the movies. A deep penetration into the darkest and most harrowing corners of the human psyche, &lt;em&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary accomplishment and a haunting American classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fascinating, shocking, and ultimately quite hopeful story of one teen’s downward spiral into mental illness by the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Tweak&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Miles is the ultimate unreliable narrator—a teen recovering from a schizophrenic breakdown who believes he is getting better . . . when in reality he is growing worse.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Driven to the point of obsession to find his missing younger brother, Teddy, and wrapped up in a romance that may or may not be the real thing, Miles is forever chasing shadows. As Miles feels his world closing around him, he struggles to keep it open, but what you think you know about his world is actually a blur of gray, and the sharp focus of reality proves startling.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Tweak&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Schizo&lt;/i&gt; is the fascinating, and ultimately quite hopeful, story of one teen's downward spiral into mental illness as he chases the clues to a missing brother. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Thirteen Reasons Why&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;It’s Kind of a Funny Story&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Reality, it turns out, is often not what you perceive it to be—sometimes, there really is someone out to get you. Made You Up tells the story of Alex, a high school senior unable to tell the difference between real life and delusion. This is a compelling and provoking literary debut that will appeal to fans of Wes Anderson, &lt;b&gt;Silver Linings Playbook&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Liar&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex fights a daily battle to figure out the difference between reality and delusion. Armed with a take-no-prisoners attitude, her camera, a Magic 8-Ball, and her only ally (her little sister), Alex wages a war against her schizophrenia, determined to stay sane long enough to get into college. She’s pretty optimistic about her chances until classes begin, and she runs into Miles. Didn't she imagine him? Before she knows it, Alex is making friends, going to parties, falling in love, and experiencing all the usual rites of passage for teenagers. But Alex is used to being crazy. She’s not prepared for normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Funny, provoking, and ultimately moving, this debut novel featuring the quintessential unreliable narrator will have readers turning the pages and trying to figure out what is real and what is made up.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Matthew Corbin suffers from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. He hasn't been to school in weeks. His hands are cracked and bleeding from cleaning. He refuses to leave his bedroom. To pass the time, he observes his neighbors from his bedroom window, making mundane notes about their habits as they bustle about the cul-de-sac. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a toddler staying next door goes missing, it becomes apparent that Matthew was the last person to see him alive. Suddenly, Matthew finds himself at the center of a high-stakes mystery, and every one of his neighbors is a suspect. Matthew is the key to figuring out what happened and potentially saving a child's life... but is he able to do so if it means exposing his own secrets, and stepping out from the safety of his home?</description>

  <description>Making friends has never been Elise Dembowski’s strong suit. All throughout her life, she’s been the butt of every joke and the outsider in every conversation. When a final attempt at popularity fails, Elise nearly gives up. Then she stumbles upon a warehouse party where she meets Vicky, a girl in a band who accepts her; Char, a cute, yet mysterious disc jockey; Pippa, a carefree spirit from England; and most importantly, a love for DJing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a refreshingly genuine and laugh-out-loud funny voice, &lt;i&gt;This Song Will Save Your Life&lt;/i&gt; is an exuberant novel about identity, friendship, and the power of music to bring people together.</description>

  <description>In a warren of crumbling buildings and desperate people called the Old City, there stands a hospital with cinderblock walls which echo with the screams of the poor souls inside. In the hospital, there is a woman. Her hair, once blonde, hangs in tangles down her back. She doesn't remember why she's in such a terrible place-just a tea party long ago, and long ears, and blood... Then, one night, a fire at the hospital gives the woman a chance to escape, tumbling out of the hole that imprisoned her, leaving her free to uncover the truth about what happened to her all those years ago. Only something else has escaped with her. Something dark. Something powerful. And to find the truth, she will have to track this beast to the very heart of the Old City, where the rabbit waits for his Alice.</description>

  <description>Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.</description>

When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/i&gt; combines vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The darkly comic crime sequel to &lt;em&gt;Sweetpea,&lt;/em&gt; following girl-next-door serial killer Rhiannon as she’s now caught between the urge to kill and her unborn baby stopping her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only they knew the real truth. It should be my face on those front pages. My headlines. I did those things, not him. I just want to stand on that doorstep and scream it: IT WAS ME. ME. ME. ME. ME!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhiannon Lewis has successfully fooled the world and framed her cheating fiancé Craig for the depraved and bloody killing spree she committed. She should be ecstatic that she’s free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for one small problem. She’s pregnant with her ex-lover’s child. The ex-lover she only recently chopped up and buried in her in-laws' garden. And as much as Rhiannon wants to continue making her way through her kill lists, a small voice inside is trying to make her stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can a killer’s urges ever really be curbed?</description>

  <description>Rumi Seto spends a lot of time worrying she doesn’t have the answers to everything. What to eat, where to go, whom to love. But there is one thing she is absolutely sure of—she wants to spend the rest of her life writing music with her younger sister, Lea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Lea dies in a car accident, and her mother sends her away to live with her aunt in Hawaii while she deals with her own grief. Now thousands of miles from home, Rumi struggles to navigate the loss of her sister, being abandoned by her mother, and the absence of music in her life. With the help of the “boys next door”—a teenage surfer named Kai, who smiles too much and doesn’t take anything seriously, and an eighty-year-old named George Watanabe, who succumbed to his own grief years ago—Rumi attempts to find her way back to her music, to write the song she and Lea never had the chance to finish.</description>

  <description>The brilliant new novel from the author of the New York Times bestseller, Everything I Never Told You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned - from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principal is playing by the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother- who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When old family friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town - and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at an unexpected and devastating cost...</description>

  <description>Hen and her husband Lloyd have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby, and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she’s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder—an obsession she doesn’t talk about anymore, but can’t fully shake either...</description>

  <description>The Golden State Killer. The East Area Rapist. The Original Night Stalker. The Visalia Ransacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monster who preyed on Californians from 1976 to 1986 was known by many aliases. And while numerous police sketches tried to capture his often-masked visage, the Golden State Killer spent more than 40 years not only faceless, but nameless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his victims, for their families and for the investigators tasked with finding him, the senselessness and brutality of the Golden State Killer's acts were matched only by the powerlessness they felt at failing to uncover his identity. To be sure, the chances of obtaining closure—or any form of justice—after so many years were slim to none, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on April 24, 2018, authorities arrested 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo at his home in Citrus Heights, Calif., based on DNA evidence linked to the crimes. After a decades-long hunt, a suspect was behind bars. Could it be that evil finally had a name?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivering all-new details about the investigation and a stunning final act to the events of Michelle McNamara's haunting bestseller, I'll Be Gone in the Dark, this is the true story of how the suspected Golden State Killer was captured, as told, first-hand, by those closest to the case:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Holes—the forensic criminologist and retired Costa County detective who spent 20 years trying to crack the Golden State Killer case, and finally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Clemente (Host)—a retired FBI profiler and former New York City prosecutor who has investigated some of the highest profile criminal cases in U.S. history, including the Unabomber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: This work contains descriptions of violent crime and sexual assault and may not be suitable for all listeners.</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;On a bright January morning in the London suburbs, a family moves into the house they’ve just bought in Trinity Avenue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nothing strange about that. Except it is your house. And you didn’t sell it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona Lawson comes home to find strangers moving into her house, she's sure there's been a mistake. She and her estranged husband, Bram, have a modern co-parenting arrangement: bird's nest custody, where each parent spends a few nights a week with their two sons at the prized family home to maintain stability for their children. But the system built to protect their family ends up putting them in terrible jeopardy. In a domino effect of crimes and misdemeanors, the nest comes tumbling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram has disappeared and so have Fiona's children. As events spiral well beyond her control, Fiona will discover just how many lies her husband was weaving and how little they truly knew each other. But Bram's not the only one with things to hide, and some secrets are best kept to oneself, safe as houses.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The serial killer isn't on trial. He's on the jury.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood actor Robert Soloman stands accused of the brutal stabbings of his wife and her lover, but he is desperately pleading that he had nothing to do with it. This is the trial of the century, and the defence want Eddie Flynn on their team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest case Eddie has ever tried before, he decides to take it on despite the overwhelming evidence that Robert is guilty. As the trial starts, Eddie becomes sure of Robert's innocence, but there's something else he is even more sure of - that there is something sinister going on in the jury box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, he is forced to ask: what if the killer isn't on the stand? What if he's on the jury?</description>

  <description>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.</description>

  <description>Milk and honey' is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</description>

  <description>First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. And only the dead are above suspicion.</description>
