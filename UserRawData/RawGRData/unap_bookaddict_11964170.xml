  <description>What’s meant to be will always find a way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfection isn’t an illusion. &lt;br /&gt;I met it, held it in my hands. &lt;br /&gt;But then it slipped right through. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfection isn’t an illusion. &lt;br /&gt;It’s elusive, cleverly evasive, and, in many ways, a horrible tease. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m not a man to be toyed with. &lt;br /&gt;Quiet, thoughtful, and even sometimes careful, &lt;br /&gt;but never someone to taunt. &lt;br /&gt;Even the most controlled men have a breaking point. &lt;br /&gt;I just met mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why mess with perfection? &lt;br /&gt;You don’t. &lt;br /&gt;Unless perfection messes with you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is book 6 in the GearShark series and is NOT a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling authors Sarina Bowen &amp;amp; Elle Kennedy return with their first Male / Male romance in 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts, 21&lt;br /&gt;Jock. Secretly a science geek. Hot AF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: So. Here goes. For her birthday, my girlfriend wants…a threesome.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Then you’ve come to the right hookup app.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Have you done this sort of thing before? With another guy?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: All the time. I'm an equal opportunity player. You?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: [crickets!]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SinnerThree, 21&lt;br /&gt;Finance major. Secretly a male dancer. Hot AF. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Well, I’m down if you are. My life is kind of a mess right now. School, work, family stress. Oh, and I live next door to the most annoying dude in the world. I need the distraction. Are you sure you want this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: I might want it a little more than I’m willing to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Hey, nothing wrong with pushing your boundaries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Tell that to my control-freak father. Anyway. What if this threesome is awkward?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Then it’s awkward. It’s not like we’ll ever have to see each other again. Right? Just promise you won’t fall in love with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Now wouldn’t that be life-changing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q&amp;amp;A about Top Secret:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Have we met these characters before in another book?&lt;br /&gt;A: No! These guys are brand new, and we can’t wait for you to meet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Is this story MM? Or is it a MMF / MFM / menage?&lt;br /&gt;A: This book is MM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Is this a love triangle story?&lt;br /&gt;A: Not really. You’ll see.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;Ask Me Anything &lt;i&gt;isn't just any YA romance. This is a badass YA romance…"&lt;/i&gt; -Hypabale.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should’ve kept my mouth shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wilmont Academy’s been living in the Dark Ages when it comes to sex ed, and someone had to take matters into her own hands. Well, I’m a kickass coder, so I created a totally anonymous, totally untraceable blog where teens can come to get real, honest, nothing-is-off-limits sex advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And holy hell, the site went viral overnight. Who knew this school was so hard up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the school administration is on a war path to shut me down, and they have Dean—my coding crush—hot on my trail. If he discovers my secret, I could lose his trust forever. And thousands of teens who need real advice won’t have anyone to turn to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask me anything…except how to make things right.</description>

  <description>Ruined. Tortured. Broken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What could have been the perfect childhood, turned into a hell that the devil himself would shy away from. I was forced to deal with an evil that would make the darkest of souls cringe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lily Noel was scarred but beautiful. She was perfectly flawed and everything that I needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attraction bordered on obsession. &lt;br /&gt;Passion bordered on ecstasy. &lt;br /&gt;Addiction bordered on insanity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing could get in the way of our love. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book contains dark themes including sexual assault and past child abuse*&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Beckett,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re reading this, well, you know the last-letter drill. You made it. I didn’t. Get off the guilt train, because I know if there was any chance you could have saved me, you would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need one thing from you: get out of the army and get to Telluride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My little sister Ella’s raising the twins alone. She’s too independent and won’t accept help easily, but she has lost our grandmother, our parents, and now me. It’s too much for anyone to endure. It’s not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here’s the kicker: there’s something else you don’t know that’s tearing her family apart. She’s going to need help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I’m gone, that means I can’t be there for Ella. I can’t help them through this. But you can. So I’m begging you, as my best friend, go take care of my sister, my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don’t make her go through it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some loves are undeniable. Some burn with the heat of summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Homer Lovelly pulled over to help a stranded damsel in distress, he never expected he’d meet his soul mate. But from the moment Claire clocked him in the head with her boot—and then kissed him—he knew she was it. She’d be his undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild, sexy, and fearless, Claire is intoxicating. She’s also leaving at the end of summer, a few short weeks away. Homer knows he shouldn’t fall for her. He also knows he doesn’t have a choice. And with September rising fast on the horizon, he’s almost out of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, can he convince Claire that what he feels is more than a summer fling, or will he watch as the woman he’s meant to marry walk out of his life forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;See why fans of The Notebook and The Summer Boyfriend will fall in love with this steamy, summer-fling romance. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[First Comes Love is a prequel to the Lovelly series. It’s a short novella, and a quick read, and it was very enjoyable.<br /><br />I originally read the Lovelly series (books 1-3) about 2 or 3 years ago. So going into this prequel I didn’t really remember much about what happened in the series, s...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows the girl is off limits. But it's so good to be bad. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this girl...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi and I have been trading hungry looks all year, and everything she does makes me smile. But I don't do girlfriends, and I certainly can't get involved with the league commissioner's daughter. I need shots on goal, not a hookup and a widely misunderstood paparazzi photo.&lt;br /&gt;Can I resist her, though? The way she teases me should be a game penalty for interference with my libido.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this guy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason wants me, but he won't admit it. That man looks at me the way a hockey player eyes the lunch buffet after practice--and I love it. &lt;br /&gt;But when victory is finally within my grasp, I blow it and humiliate myself. Even then I can't even avoid him--as the team intern, I'm in constant view of his hard body and cocky smile. &lt;br /&gt;I need another chance. Jason Castro is about to learn the true meaning of an overnight sensation.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Three years ago she was left in pieces . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most college freshmen love the newfound freedom of living on campus, but none of them craves it like Beth Caplan. One ill-fated night when she was fifteen left her locked in a posh prison of private tutors. &lt;i&gt;It's for the best&lt;/i&gt;, everyone said, and maybe it was. But after years of hard work and healing, the one person who never thought of her as broken could be the one to break her all over again. And Beth can't seem to stay away now any more than she could all those years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as David March learned his best friend's little sister was enrolling at his school, he promised to look after her, and promised himself he'd keep a safe distance. But the sweet little girl he'd grown up with has transformed into a gorgeous young woman, and she's attracting attention from people she shouldn't-like the ex who nearly destroyed her and a strange new student with a disturbing habit of showing up wherever Beth goes. But for David, the most troubling discovery is realizing that he doesn't just want Beth to be safe. He wants her to be his.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One story. Two couples.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with a man who didn’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started out as romance ended in hell.&lt;br /&gt;His words turned to razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;His kisses converted to fists. &lt;br /&gt;His embrace became my cage.&lt;br /&gt;His body transformed into a weapon, stealing parts of me until ultimately….&lt;br /&gt;I broke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated him.&lt;br /&gt;My sole job in life became to protect our daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t sure I’d ever escape the prison he’d skillfully crafted from my fears. &lt;br /&gt;Until the day our savior arrived. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of how I escaped the man who thought he owned me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The transfer of my life and my family.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One story. Two couples.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proposed on our first date. &lt;br /&gt;She laughed and told me I was insane. Less than a day later, she said yes.&lt;br /&gt;It was a whirlwind, but we were happy… &lt;br /&gt;Until we got greedy and wanted a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a life I couldn’t give her, not for lack of trying. Fertility just wasn’t on our side. We sought out doctors and treatments. Spent money we didn’t have. Lied to our families. Smiled for our friends. Put on a brave face for a world that didn’t understand.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we were successful…&lt;br /&gt;Until we were forced to bury our son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were left broken, battered, and destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;They say love is in the details, but it was the details that ruined us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of how I took back what had always been mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The retrieval of my wife and our family.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A modern way of finding love. One deserted island of luxury. Two people. Three out cards. And a whole lot of possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melinda takes the advice of her best friend, Chris. She signs up to a new dating service that pairs you statistically to the one you’re supposed to love. Finding it — love that is — using the more conventional methods, has not been a successful venture for Mindy, and with her biological clock ticking, she uses a more desperate method and takes the plunge into a possible happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, when she boards the boat to a secret location, she doesn’t realise the man waiting for her is someone she’s previously met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chance encounters occur more frequently than we realise. Being blind to them is part of a bustling world. But, being faced with them can lead to a hilarious three weeks between two opposites who might just attract.</description>

  <description>Sometimes starting over is the only choice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken-hearted and looking for revenge, Phoebe Reede heads back to the US to take up a new challenge. Only, when she discovers who her teammate and rival is, the challenge might prove too great. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she knew life away from home wouldn’t be easy, she never expected to be faced with an unpleasant surprise from her ex-boyfriend, or to be as drawn to him as ever. She needs to remain professional and push aside her feelings for him, but will she let someone else steal her heart away instead? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will it take to prove she’s not afraid to take the risk? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to strong language and sexual content not intended for anyone under the age of 18. Some books in this series contain content, including sexual assault and violence, that may trigger emotional distress in some readers.**</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;From International Bestselling author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp, comes the new standalone in the Winter Games series...&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life had been a series of unfortunate events:&lt;br /&gt;Some of them out of my control, some of them entirely my fault.&lt;br /&gt;I was only weeks away from being able to take my daughter and finally be free from the past that had imprisoned us.&lt;br /&gt;And then Tamsin Lucas showed up on my doorstep, looking every inch the innocent angel yet &lt;em&gt;begging to be ruined&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I told myself I could live not knowing her secrets or the reason for her hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I swore I could survive never touching her again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I needed her to homeschool my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m fighting to rein in my desire for the woman who’s always been perfect and protect her from those who are out to destroy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tammy was too good to want someone like me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if I was too bad to care to stay away?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the right choice was the slogan for my life and the motto for my soul, until all the right decisions led to a very wrong result.&lt;br /&gt;In the moment when life felt like a catastrophe, &lt;br /&gt;I ran to him. &lt;strong&gt;Nick Frost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The callous man who was colder than the mountain and possessed more secrets than it did snowflakes.&lt;br /&gt;For one night, &lt;em&gt;I traded sense for sensibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and my well-kept order for his comfortable chaos.&lt;br /&gt;I thought one night and one wrong choice would be enough until he became my boss and wrong began to look a lot like right.&lt;br /&gt;With every day that passes, I learn there’s more to his story than the world knows and more to the unquenchable desire being written between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick was too bad to want someone like me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if what we had was too good to keep me away?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN TOO DEEP is the fourth standalone in the Winter Games series...&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>She was just a kid when she found me lying injured beside the road and saved my life. I promised her I’d return if she ever needed me. Twelve years later, I answer the phone and hear her voice: a biker gang’s about to sell her to the highest bidder. I tear the place apart and we roar off on my Harley...but the kid I remember has grown up into a woman I can’t resist, with long red hair and curves that don’t quit. And now she thinks I’m a goddamn hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time we ride and her body presses against mine, I just want to rip her dress right off. Neither of us can resist...but for her sake, I can’t let her get close. She claims there’s still good in me but she doesn’t know how much blood I’ve got on my hands. Now the gang who took her want her back and they’re willing to destroy my whole MC to get her. But it’s too late. I’ve fallen for her. And I’m never letting her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standalone bad boy romantic suspense with HEA, no cheating.</description>

  <description>Emily is the President's daughter. Gorgeous but innocent...not the kind of woman who should get involved with me, an ex-Marine with a bad boy rep. But when a sniper opens fire, the need to protect her is stronger than anything I've ever felt. Suddenly, we're on the ground, my body covering hers. I save her life then walk away, sure that I'll never see her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a shaken Emily asks me to become her bodyguard, I can't turn her down. Now I have to wear a suit and call her ma'am when all I want to do is slam her up against the wall and tear her clothes off. Neither of us can resist...but I can't let her get close, not with what's lurking in my past. And the danger is far from over. The White House is under threat...and I'll do whatever it takes to protect the woman I've fallen for.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29506826-growing-and-kissing" rel="nofollow"&gt;B01CYT8S3K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my sister is diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, there’s only one way to raise the half a million dollars I need to save her: use my skills with plants to grow marijuana. But I’m a botany geek, not a drug lord. I need help. I need the scariest guy on the block: Sean O’Harra, the muscled, sledge hammer-wielding badass even the dealers fear. He says that he destroys everything he touches...so why can’t I stop thinking about his big hands all over my body? As the summer heat rises, I’ll have to juggle my normal life and my new life as a criminal while cops, dealers and gangs threaten us on all sides...but the hardest thing of all might be keeping Sean and me apart. I’m a good girl...but I think he’s about to turn me really, really bad.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’ll make it out of here, Brian. I swear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had everything. I was school quarterback, popular with girls, and my dad was proud of me. I told myself it didn’t matter no one knew the real me. And then I nearly died. Landon saved my life. He’s the bravest guy I know. He came out a few years ago, proud and fierce, and he ran into gunfire to help others. Me, I’m a mess. Can’t even stand to be in a room with the curtains open. But here’s the thing about losing it all: You get a chance to start over and be someone new, someone true. Only how can I move on when the two shooters who attacked our school were never caught? And why do I feel like I’m still in the crosshairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Landon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will you kiss me? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across Brian Marshall, the hottest guy in school, dying on the cafeteria floor, I did what anyone would do. I tried to save him. His request surprised me, but I figured he needed comfort, so I kissed him on the forehead. When he survived and came back to school, he was broken in body and mind. He still needed me, and soon we were unlikely besties. But what I witnessed that day woke me up. I want to demand action on gun control, lead protests, raise my fist. I’ll tear the world down if I have to. And if I can get the boy of my dreams and save the world at the same time? I’ll take it. Only I didn’t understand that the horror at Jefferson Waller High wasn’t over.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From International Amazon Bestselling Author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp, comes the new &lt;em&gt;standalone&lt;/em&gt; in the Winter Games series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emmett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Do. Not. Touch.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Ryder came with more warning signs than a museum exhibit.&lt;br /&gt;Under twenty-one. Best friend’s baby sister. &lt;em&gt;Heart-broken.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only supposed to keep an eye on her and keep my hands to myself.&lt;br /&gt;But her sunshine sucked me in.&lt;br /&gt;Why did she have to want me? Why did she have to want me to save her?&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t her savior. I wasn’t the prince in her fairytale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was only the asshole in shining armor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some, heartbreak becomes a habit.&lt;br /&gt;Losing so much had taught me that it’s easier to just give up the things you care about before they are taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because you can’t lose what you don’t have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up the warmth of the sun and sand hoping that the cold, snowy mountains of Colorado would be able to numb whatever feelings I had left and bury the pieces of my heart under the frost.&lt;br /&gt;And then I met Emmett Jameson - &lt;strong&gt;the King of the Mountain&lt;/strong&gt; and my brother’s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;He was cold and controlling - treating me like the child that I wasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;He was everything that promised to break what was left of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I needed him for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shattered heart would be safe wanting someone like him.&lt;br /&gt;Then again, heartbreak &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; my bad habit.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;NOW A #1 INTERNATIONAL AMAZON BEST SELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Channing &lt;br /&gt;They say how far you go is directly correlated to how much you are willing to risk.&lt;br /&gt;As a snowboarder, I was used to risking a lot - specifically life and limb every time I flew down the mountain and into the air.&lt;br /&gt;This time though, I was risking it all. I’d already lost so much. Winning was all I had left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth?&lt;/strong&gt; I hadn’t been invited to the X Games, but my brother had. Beneath my snow clothes, mask, helmet, and goggles, who was going to be able to tell that it wasn’t Chance Ryder competing for the gold, but me, his twin sister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The risk?&lt;/strong&gt; The one man who could teach me what I needed to win was the one man I would be competing against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem?&lt;/strong&gt; I was falling for that very man. Hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I never fell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when there was no snow to cushion my landing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wyatt &lt;br /&gt;Wyatt Olsen &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; wins. That’s how the world knows me.&lt;br /&gt;I was the best. The X Games, the Snowboarding Open, the Olympics.&lt;br /&gt;I won everything - everything except the race against time, against age.&lt;br /&gt;That, I had lost.&lt;br /&gt;This was my last competition and I had no idea what was next.&lt;br /&gt;My future was completely up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;Until Channing Ryder crashed into my boards and my life.&lt;br /&gt;She gave me purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing left for me to win was &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up in the Air is a standalone novel and the first book in the Winter Games series.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Love plumbs deep below the surface. In 1946, Sarah, a grieving war widow goes to the carnival with friends and is riveted by the tattooed man in the freak show, adorned in head to toe body art. Later she discovers the man hiding in her hayloft, escaped from imprisonment by the evil owner. She shelters Tom on her farm, fighting a powerful attraction while learning about his mysterious past and gentle nature. When a child goes missing, Tom uses his psychic gift to find her but his assistance doesn't relieve the locals' mistrust of such an exotic stranger. Small-town prejudice tears the lovers apart and a very real threat from the carnival owner endangers them. Can the lovers rise above obstacles of fear and hatred to create the family both have always craved?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestseller Penelope Douglas introduces Quinn, younger sister to Jared, Madoc, and Jaxon, in the latest novella in the series that began with Jared and Tate in Bully....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn Caruthers has several problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father, Jason, and her three older brothers, Jared, Madoc, and Jaxon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the close watch of the men in her family, Quinn has found it nearly impossible to spread her wings—or even date—without them jumping in to hover. And when a family friend—several years older—from her childhood captures her heart, she knows they’re going to be a problem. Lucas Morrow is a man—experienced, sophisticated, and important. And knowing her brothers, he may as well be forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lucas left town years ago and shows no signs of returning. Quinn knows she shouldn’t wait for him anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a package turns up on her doorstep with no return address and its contents reveal family secrets that threaten to turn Quinn’s world upside down. She’s never asked about the tumultuous path of her parents’ romantic history, but she soon learns their happy marriage had a very rocky and passionate start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she begins to see things around her with new eyes, Quinn will have to make tough choices about whether she’ll keep waiting…or finally go after what she really wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Next to Never is a 60,000 word novella from Quinn's point-of-view. It is not her love story. That will be a full-length novel eventually. This story covers some family history, introduces the new generation, and catches up with the original couples.</description>

  <description>Everyone wants to be me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s the sway of my skirt or the way I flip my hair, but I don’t care. Even though their attention is the last thing I crave, I just can’t stop. I dominate the track, the speed rattles my bones, and the wind and the crowd screams my name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m her. The girl driver. The queen of the race. And I’m surviving—something he thought I’d never do.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They all talk about him. Did you see Jared Trent on T.V? What did you think of his last race, Tate? When is he coming back to town, Tate? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I refuse to care too much. Because when Jared does come home, I won’t be here. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tatum Brandt is gone. I’m someone new.</description>

  <description>Jaxon is the guy she’s supposed to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K.C. is the girl he won’t let get away....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K.C. Carter has always followed the rules—until this year, when a mistake leaves her the talk of her college campus and her carefully arranged life comes crashing to a halt. Now she’s stuck in her small hometown for the summer to complete her court-ordered community service, and to make matters worse, trouble is living right next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaxon Trent is the worst kind of temptation and exactly what K.C. was supposed to stay away from in high school. But he never forgot her. She was the one girl who wouldn’t give him the time of day and the only one to ever say no. Fate has brought K.C. back into his life—except what he thought was a great twist of luck turns out to be too close for comfort. As the bond between them grows, he discovers that convincing K.C. to get out from her mother’s shadow is hard, but revealing the darkest parts of his soul is nearly impossible.…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New Adult sensation and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Until You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madoc and Fallon. Two estranged teenagers playing games that push the boundaries between love and war…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the two years she’s been away at boarding school, there was no word from her. Back when we lived in the same house, she used to cut me down during the day and then leave her door open for me at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stupid then, but now I’m ready to beat her at her own game…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years and I can tell he still wants me, even if he acts like he’s better than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t be scared away. Or pushed down. I’ll call his bluff and fight back. That’s what he wants, right? As long as I keep my guard up, he’ll never know how much he affects me….</description>

  <description>***This novel contains graphic sexual content and harsh language. It is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been so angry that hitting things felt good? Or so numb that you actually felt high? The past few years have been like that for me. Traveling between fury and indifference with no stops in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people hate me for it, while others are scared of me. But none of them can hurt me, because I don't care about anything or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Tatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love her so much that I hate her. We used to be friends, but I found out that I couldn't trust her or anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hurt her. I pushed her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still need her. The sight of her centers me, and I can pool all of my anger into her. Engaging her, challenging her, bullying her...they are my food, my air, and the last part of me that feels anything human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she left. She went to France for a year, and came back a different girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I push, she pushes back.</description>

  <description>My first memory was of a slap, hard across the face: the sting on my cheek and the jarring of my bones as I slammed back into my bed. It was my dad who had hit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my memories were much of the same and no one ever saw, no one ever fought to help, no one ever cared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new neighbor cared, rescued the twelve-year-old I had been from a beating. Always thought I'd suffer the nightmare alone, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mace Donati saved me that day in all the ways a person could be saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And his daughter, Mia, she became the friend I had always wanted, my conscience when my own faltered, the light that led me home when I had lost my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl who grew into the only woman I would ever love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you realize you're more like your father than the good people who took you in and gave you a home, the only way to return their kindness is to let them go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let them go, got so far lost in the shadows I couldn't remember who I was anymore. Mia never gave up on me. She fought for me, kept the light on so I'd find my way back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when I did, life threw us a curveball. I had to hurt Mia in order to save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when my past comes back to haunt me and I almost lose her, I'm ready to fight for her...fight to find a way back into her heart while keeping the demons from my past from finishing what they started.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cole Campbell</description>

  <description>After an intense whirlwind romance, Karrie Parker thought she had it all: a sexy husband, a loving family, a great career and a beautiful home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they lived a life fit for royalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when tragedy strikes, Karrie is devastated and left to face the consequences of her husband’s deepest, darkest secrets. Discovering the strength to carry on while making important, life-changing decisions, she finds herself desperate for answers. And holding the key to the puzzle is the one man she loathes immensely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For up and coming motorcycle drag racer Tyler Strong, keeping painful secrets was never part of the plan. Racing motorcycles and winning was all he ever wanted to do, but when his best friend’s lies begin to unravel, Tyler is sent into a tailspin when he’s forced to come face to face with the one woman he vowed to stay away from. The woman he refuses to speak to, the woman he avoids, the woman he watches…from a distance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the truth becomes clear, will destiny bring these two unlikely souls together or tear them apart forever?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From International Amazon Bestselling Author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp, comes the new &lt;em&gt;standalone&lt;/em&gt; in the Winter Games series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐞 (𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝟏𝟎): 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐨 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬. 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐚𝐝.&lt;br /&gt;Do you know what it’s like to lose everything? I do.&lt;br /&gt;Eight years ago, Jessa Lynn Madison and the title ‘Best Snowboarder in the US’ were both mine.&lt;br /&gt;And then she betrayed me and the mountain had followed suit. &lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I drank, the truth was hard to swallow when it meant choking on my pride.&lt;br /&gt;And no matter how much I screwed, the truth was that I still wanted her.&lt;br /&gt;Anger. Rage. They don’t even begin to describe how I feel.&lt;br /&gt;I was never going to be able to compete again, but life had given me the perfect opportunity to have Jessa. &lt;br /&gt;And to break her.&lt;br /&gt;Misery loves company. And Jessa was about to be my company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐥 (𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝟎): 𝐀 𝐬𝐲𝐦𝐛𝐨𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬.&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was a fresh start in the town I once called home.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad home was littered with memories of him. Chance Ryder. &lt;br /&gt;The man I’d loved. The man I’d left. &lt;br /&gt;The man who was now my patient. And my roommate.&lt;br /&gt;I know he wants to use me. I know he wants to hurt me.&lt;br /&gt;But I also know that I can’t stop myself from wanting him.&lt;br /&gt;And wanting him has always been my downfall.&lt;br /&gt;Now all I can think about is how to tell him the truth and beg his forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I, of all people, should know that explanations and apologies won’t matter.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Chance Ryder, he’ll hold onto his pride&lt;br /&gt;like he should be holding onto me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the Ride is the third standalone in the Winter Games series.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Chase Gallardo ran toward freedom with his fellow survivors after having spent five months in captivity. He hasn’t stopped running since. Only now, it’s the memories he’s constantly trying to escape. Haunting echoes of a man who forced Chase to play the part of another, the kidnapper’s younger brother. Chase may have survived, but that doesn’t mean he’s really living. Until one day, when his employee tells him there’s a man sitting at the bar, wearing only underwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remy Stahl has given up—almost. For a year, alcohol, drugs, and faces without names have kept him company. But he has two friends who refuse to give up on him, and they lock him up in his house in an attempt to save him from himself. Though, never underestimate an addict’s desire to see the bottom of another bottle. Remy escapes, and he doesn’t give a rat’s ass that he’s nearly naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sequel to Aftermath, where Cam and Austin met, struggled, and fell in love. Outcome takes us back to Bakersfield with Chase and Remy’s story. Fueled by anger, guilt, and shame, they’re not off to an easy start. But it’s only a matter of time before they learn how much they need each other in order to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story contains some violence, drug use, and scenes of an explicit, erotic nature between two men and is intended for adults, 18+. Characters portrayed are 18 or older.</description>

  <description>Austin Huntley and Cameron Nash are like night and day. One is a family man, works in a nice office, drives an expensive car, and is content to be content. The other one is an antisocial car mechanic with a short fuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things don’t change. Others definitely do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After surviving a five-months long kidnapping together, they struggle to return to normalcy, all while realizing that they're more drawn to each other than they ever could've imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I know I'm not normal, but I'm not fucking stupid."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Define normal," Austin countered quietly, meeting Cam in the doorway. "And for not being normal, you're the only person in the world who makes sense right now. What does that say about me?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story contains violence and scenes of an explicit, erotic nature between two men and is intended for adults, 18+.</description>

      <![CDATA[Cara Dee was one of the authors that was new to me at a book event that I went to, and this series looked like it would be a good read so bought it. Glad I did, because I really liked this one. It was an emotional and dark read, and I really grew to love these characters. I picked up the second b...]]>

  <description>Forget SEALS, Marines, Fighter Pilots — I have the most dangerous job in the world. And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Spears is part of an elite group who lives and breathes danger. Where others run from it, he walks towards it, calm, focussed ice-cold. James is a top EOD operative.&lt;br /&gt; Explosive…&lt;br /&gt; Ordnance…&lt;br /&gt; Disposal…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d call him a bomb disposal expert. Or crazy. A guy with a death wish. He’s heard it all before and he doesn’t give a shit. He’s the best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say he doesn’t have blood in his veins, he has ice. They say he has no nerves.&lt;br /&gt;All that’s about to be tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amira is recruited by the CIA to infiltrate a terrorist cell living in rural Pennsylvania. She’s the perfect plant, no one would ever suspect her. Because her brother was killed when a bomb was dropped on the Syrian hospital where he was working as a doctor. And now hate burns deeply inside her. She’s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what they tell James when he’s told to train her to be the best damn bomb-maker there is. In a secret camp, deep in the woods, James teaches her everything he knows about building bombs. He’s not a praying man, but now he’s really hoping that he’s doing the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he trust her? Will she ever trust him? Who is playing who? And who will pay the ultimate price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Codename: Hansel and Gretel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 1 in the &lt;i&gt;EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Series&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Note About This Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This hasn’t been an easy book to write for lots of different reasons — it’s important to me, so getting the research right has been tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have close friends from the EOD community, and close friends from the Muslim community, who have helped and guided me through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have guided and advised, but ultimately it’s my book, so any mistakes are mine and mine alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim is to be respectful to both communities, and to tell a story of love and compassion in a very dark place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be ‘triggers’ for some people in the story, so please be advised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it’s a love story, not a hate story, and I hope that’s the part that remains with you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The sound of the ocean, the crash of the waves as they kick up against the sand and rocks—these are the only sounds Megan Greene wants to hear. She wants to leave the rest of the world behind, and find some peace. The offer of a private house on the beach, set in a small town in Maine, is perfect. Time to think—to be by herself. It’s all she wants. It’s the escape she needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she stumbles across the painting that seems to echo her own chaotic mindset. Until she meets the unfriendly artist behind the stormy painting and discovers his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Zachary Adams wants is to be left alone. His canvases, and the unending scope of the ocean and sand, are his life. They direct him—fill his hours. Bring him focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she enters his life. She dredges up memories of the past—the haunting images he has hidden for years; the fears he has never shared. A story he keeps buried below the surface. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she make him see what he is missing? Can he trust her enough to believe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they embark on a journey where their pasts collide and threaten to tear them apart. Will their fragile bond hold or wash away with the ebbing tide?</description>

  <description>“Things you should know about me from the very beginning:&lt;br /&gt;I was born to true love, witnessed the destruction it causes, and vowed never to let such agony happen to me. I am not a story-teller like my father. I am not a writer like my mother. I am just a son—their son.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy being alone.&lt;br /&gt;And that is all I ever want to be.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JACOB&lt;br /&gt;The day he was born, Jacob learned his hardest and longest lesson.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t a lesson a boy should learn so young, but from his earliest memories he knew where happiness lives, so does tragedy. Where love exists, so does heartbreak. And where hope resides, so does sorrow.&lt;br /&gt;That lesson carved him from the kid to the teen to the man.&lt;br /&gt;And nothing and no one could change his mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOPE&lt;br /&gt;I first met him when he was fourteen at a movie premiere of all places. A movie based on his parent’s life.&lt;br /&gt;He was stoic, strong, suspicious, and secretive.&lt;br /&gt;I was only ten, but I felt something for him. A strange kind of sorrow that made me want to hug and heal him.&lt;br /&gt;I was the daughter of the actor hired to play his father.&lt;br /&gt;We shared similarities.&lt;br /&gt;I recognized parts of him because they were parts of me.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how many times we met. No matter how many times I tried.&lt;br /&gt;He stayed true to his vow to never fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A full-length, standalone romance from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Archer's Voice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kira Dallaire is desperate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some challenges in life seem too hard to overcome. With little money, and even fewer options, the quick-witted and vibrant twenty-two-year-old needs to reinvent herself. Known for her generous heart and impulsive personality, she devises a survival plan, possibly her most outrageous idea yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grayson Hawthorn is losing hope.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some obstacles in life seem too hard to overcome. Betrayal definitely being one of them. With limited capital, and dwindling resources, he is attempting to resurrect his failing family vineyard, a self-imposed vow seemingly destined to fail. That is until a young woman enters his office with an outlandish, unexpected proposition impossible to refuse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as a temporary business arrangement, soon evolves into more as vivacious, spirited Kira challenges detached, arrogant Grayson to want more from life. &lt;i&gt;To want more for himself.&lt;/i&gt; But as their wills clash and fiery passion ignites, they'll realize that sometimes the past creates walls too difficult to climb, and that lies and deception rarely precede a happily every after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kira and Grayson race toward their destiny, they will discover that some vows are meant to be broken, and others are worth risking everything for . . . even your very own heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A STANDALONE SIGN OF LOVE NOVEL, INSPIRED BY LIBRA. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>The moment she met Callen Hayes, eleven-year-old Jessica Creswell knew he was a broken prince. &lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt; prince. They became each other's refuge, a safe and magical place far from their troubled lives. Until the day Callen kissed her&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;Jessica's first real, dreamy kiss—and then disappeared from her life without a word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, everyone knows who Callen Hayes is. Famous composer. Infamous bad boy. What no one knows is that Callen's music is now locked deep inside, trapped behind his own inner demons. It's only when he withdraws to France to drink his way through the darkness that Callen stumbles into the one person who makes the music return. Jessica. &lt;i&gt;His Jessie&lt;/i&gt;. And she still tastes of fresh, sweet innocence . . . even as she sets his blood on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they don't belong in each other's worlds anymore. There are too many mistakes. Too many secrets. Too many lies. All they have is that instinctive longing, that need—and something that looks dangerously like love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No one lays open the heart and soul quite like &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mia Sheridan.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A broken woman . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal learned long ago that love brings only pain. Feeling nothing at all is far better than being hurt again. She guards her wounded heart behind a hard exterior and carries within her a deep mistrust of men, who, in her experience, have only ever used and taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A man in need of help . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Gabriel Dalton walks into her life. Despite the terrible darkness of his past, there's an undeniable goodness in him. And even though she knows the cost, Crystal finds herself drawn to Gabriel. His quiet strength is wearing down her defenses and his gentle patience is causing her to question everything she thought she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only love can mend a shattered heart . . .&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal and Gabriel never imagined that the world, which had stolen everything from them, would bring them a deep love like this. Except fate will only take them so far, and now the choice is theirs: Harden their hearts once again or find the courage to shed their painful pasts.</description>

  <description>There were two brothers—identical twins—and though I loved them both, my soul belonged to only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annalia Del Valle has loved Preston Sawyer all her life. The daughter of an impoverished migrant farmworker, she grew up as an outcast in what was no more than a tiny, cooped up shack in California’s Central Valley. But her heart found freedom in the land, in the wide-open spaces of Sawyer Farm, and in the boys who were her only friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston has yearned for Annalia since he was a boy. But a sense of honor kept him from pursuing her until he’s unable to hold back any longer and their worlds—and bodies—collide one hot summer night. A night that sets off a chain of events that will alter their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Annalia is back in town after disappearing without a trace for six long months. Determined to reclaim her heart, her life, and the baby she left behind—the son who was created in a moment of lust and love and pent-up yearning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston has survived grief, a ravaging drought, and the despair of heartache, but he’s not sure he can survive Annalia again. And he might be unwilling to try. Will pride and bitterness keep him from the one thing he’s always longed for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you heal what is irreparably broken? How do you forgive that which is unforgivable? How do you discover that real honor comes not from circumstance, but from the place deep in our hearts where truth resides? And how do you move beyond the wounds of the past to discover that some loves are as solid as the ground beneath your feet, and as enduring as the earth itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A STAND-ALONE SIGN OF LOVE NOVEL, INSPIRED BY GEMINI. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Holden Scott is the prince of professional football. At least he was before he lost it all . . . or more to the point, before he threw it all away. Now he's out of a job, out of the public's good graces, and perhaps just a little out of his mind. So when a friend offers up his remote lodge in the wilds of Colorado, giving Holden some time away to get his life back on track, he can hardly say no. The last thing he expects is to see a beautiful girl in the woods—one wearing a white, lace dress who appears in the moonlight, and leaves no footprints behind. Is she a dream? A ghost? A product of his muddled imagination? Or something entirely different? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight Lily is the haunting love story of two lost souls reaching for each other in the dark. A tale of healing, acceptance, and the worlds we create to protect our own hearts. It is a story of being lost, of being found, and of being in the place between. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a stand-alone Sign of Love novel, inspired by &lt;i&gt;Virgo&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Archer's Voice&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Becoming Calder&lt;/i&gt; is the first part in a two-part romance series. The conclusion, &lt;i&gt;Finding Eden&lt;/i&gt;, is available now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a place in modern day America with no electricity, no plumbing, and no modern conveniences. In this place, there is no room for dreams, no space for self-expression, and no tolerance for ambition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this place, there is a boy with the body of a god and the heart of a warrior. He is strong and faithful and serves his family honorably. But he dares to dream of more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this place, there is a girl with the face of an angel and a heart full of courage. To her family, she is the vision of obedient perfection. But she dares to want that which she has been told can never be hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Becoming Calder&lt;/i&gt; is the story of good versus evil, fear versus bravery, and the truth that the light of love has always found its way into even the darkest of places . . . From the beginning of time, to the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE FIRST PART IN A &lt;b&gt;TWO-PART&lt;/b&gt; SIGN OF LOVE SERIES INSPIRED BY AQUARIUS. THE SECOND PART, &lt;i&gt;FINDING EDEN&lt;/i&gt;, IS AVAILABLE NOW. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and graphic sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Charlotte has spent her twenties adrift, floating from interest to interest, job to job, and guy to guy, searching for a spark but never quite finding it. All she knows is that she won’t discover it working as a waitress at a pies-and-fries joint in Los Angeles or living with her fun but aimless best friend in a tiny apartment in the Arts District.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlotte collides with Adam, a gorgeous and soulful painter who seems just as lost as she feels. Their instant connection turns into a midnight drink… and a whirlwind night of champagne, Chinese food, and the kind of conversation that only happens in romantic comedies. But the next morning, Adam gives Charlotte the cold shoulder, leaving her confused and hurt—and wondering if the few odd moments between them the night before were red flags in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later, Charlotte hasn’t been able to shake Adam, so she decides to find out what happened the morning after their magical night together. This fateful decision rewrites their wild love story, but what Charlotte doesn’t know yet is that the ending has already been written.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sweet Thing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nowhere But Here&lt;/i&gt; comes a deeply emotional contemporary romance about the second chances waiting beyond the shattered dreams of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the bright arena lights of a rodeo show, young Avelina Belo falls for a handsome cowboy with a larger-than-life personality. After a whirlwind courtship, she happily moves away from her family in northern California and settles into married life with her cowboy on a seven-thousand-acre cattle ranch in Montana. One freak accident later, Avelina’s hopes for the future come to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate Myers graduated from UCLA medical school at the top of his class, ready to follow in the footsteps of his father, a superstar cardiothoracic surgeon. Six years later, Nate’s career is being ruined by a malpractice suit. Questioning himself for the first time, he retreats to a Montana cattle ranch to visit his uncle and gain perspective. There, he meets a beautiful young woman named Avelina who teaches him more than he ever knew about matters of the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes you fall for Mr. Right. And sometimes for Mr. Right Now… &lt;br /&gt;May&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did you hear the one about the girl who walks into a bar and catches her live-in lover kissing someone else? No? You’re the only one in town who missed it. &lt;br /&gt;Luckily Alec is there to wrap me up in strong arms and carry me out the door before things get too ugly. And that’s not all Alec is good at. Our unexpected chemistry makes him the perfect rebound guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alec&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should know better than to hook up with my rival’s little sister, but the fiery look in May’s eyes really turns my crank. She needs cheering up, and I’m just the guy for the job. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’ll fall in love. Not even after a string of scorching hot trysts, and the realization that we’re good at the same things: wild nights and familial disappointment. I don’t do love, never have, never will. So this is the perfect arrangement, for both of us. &lt;br /&gt;Nobody would approve, but nobody has to know…</description>

  <description>A serialized story from Sarina Bowen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 1016 people in the freshman class at Harkness College. I can’t be the only socially awkward nerd girl virgin among them. Right?&lt;br /&gt;It’s time I learn to talk to guys without blushing and stammering. So I take a confidence-building job at the student tutoring center. Twelve bucks an hour, plus human interaction. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;A fun-loving French Canadian hockey hunk, that’s what.&lt;br /&gt;When Pepe Gerault sits down at my tutoring table, my brain shuts off and my mouth goes right into hyperdrive. Even the sound of my name on his lips—Josephine—gives me a mini orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;I want to hand him my V-card. But all I manage to hand him is…my thesaurus. And my dignity. All seems lost, until I hatch a plan to get him alone…&lt;br /&gt;Get it only in Sarina's newsletter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you sign up after the serialization has already begun, your first email will contain links to all the existing chapters. You won't miss a thing!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mason Boone. A former Navy SEAL who lives deep in the mountains, sleeps under the stars and hunts for his food. He’s rugged, untamed and gorgeous. And completely off limits: I’m an FBI agent and he’s a fugitive on his way to a military prison. But when another prisoner on our flight stages a breakout and the plane crashes, stranding us in the Alaskan wilderness, Mason becomes my only hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're on opposite sides of the law...but the way he looks at me makes me melt. Could he really be innocent and can I help him overcome the past that haunts him? We're going to need to work together to survive but the greatest danger we face isn't nature: the other prisoner and his gang are out there...and they're hunting us.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some heroes wear capes. Some prefer sensory sacks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmet Washington has never let the world define him, even though he, his boyfriend, Jeremey, and his friends aren’t considered “real” adults because of their disabilities. When the State of Iowa restructures its mental health system and puts the independent living facility where they live in jeopardy, Emmet refuses to be forced into substandard, privatized corporate care. With the help of Jeremey and their friends, he starts a local grassroots organization and fights every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to navigating his boyfriend’s increased depression and anxiety, Emmet has to make his autistic tics acceptable to politicians and donors, and he wonders if they’re raising awareness or putting their disabilities on display. When their campaign attracts the attention of the opposition’s powerful corporate lobbyist, Emmet relies on his skill with calculations and predictions and trusts he can save the day—for himself, his friends, and everyone with disabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He only hopes there isn't a variable in his formula he’s failed to foresee.</description>

  <description>After a near fatal car crash leaves him scarred both physically and emotionally, Matt Harmon finds the solitude of his huge, lonely house too much to bear. Hiring nurse James Hayden to look after him seems like the best idea for Matt, whose fierce independence has been compromised by his injuries. The two men clash from the start as James struggles to help Matt rebuild his shattered body and heal his crushed soul. The bond they form is forged in fire and ice, and the wounds they inflict on one another can only be erased by Matt's admission that he can't live without James's loving touch. Will Matt realize too late that James is the only one who can rescue him from himself?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes life requires a partner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Maurer has bounced back, more or less, from the neck injury that permanently benched his semipro football career. He hates his soul-killing office job, but he loves volunteering at a local community center. The only fly in his ointment is the dance instructor, Laurie Parker, who can’t seem to stay out of his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie was once one of the most celebrated ballet dancers in the world, but now he volunteers at Halcyon Center to avoid his society mother’s machinations. It would be a perfect escape, except for the oaf of a football player cutting him glares from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Laurie has a ballroom dancing emergency and Ed stands in as his partner, their perceptions of each other turn upside down. Dancing leads to friendship, being friends leads to becoming lovers, but most important of all, their partnership shows them how to heal the pain of their pasts. Because with every turn across the floor, Ed and Laurie realize the only escape from their personal demons is to keep dancing—together.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“What do you do when you write down all your secrets? No…that’s not enough. What do you do when you write down all your secrets and the one person who should never read them does? &lt;br /&gt;I’ll tell you what you do.&lt;br /&gt;You hope.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;REN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren didn’t know the meaning of love until he took Della for his own.&lt;br /&gt;To begin with he hated her, but as the months bled into years, he learned the opposite of hate, dedicating his life to giving her everything.&lt;br /&gt;Every sacrifice, every gift, he gave wholeheartedly.&lt;br /&gt;But then love turned to lust and ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DELLA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stupid to write my secrets down, but I’d been stupid before so it was nothing new.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t blame him, hate him, fix him.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to move on without him.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to delete the secrets I’d written.&lt;br /&gt;Until something happened.&lt;br /&gt;Until he came back and read my stupid secrets.&lt;br /&gt;And nothing was the same after that.</description>

  <description>Unsure. That's how I'm feeling about my entire life. Just when everything's good and I have it all under control, my girl Chelsea decides she's going to leave me for the summer. Despite my disappointment, I have to support her. It's what she wants, an opportunity she can't say no to and no way will I be the one to stop her. I love her too much to hold her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opportunities are happening for me too, though. A big one that my brother-in-law Drew says I can't pass up. I'm working extra hard. So is Chelsea. It's like we don't have any time to get together. We keep making the same promise--only five more days until we see each other again. But we keep breaking that promise. Is our relationship strong enough to survive all of these changes?</description>

Suspended from my college football team and forced to cut back my hours at The District bar because of my crappy grades, I can’t keep turning to my sister, Fable, and her pro-football playing husband, Drew, to bail me out. I just can’t seem to find my own way. Weed and sex are irresistible temptations—and it’s messed up that I secretly hand over money to our junkie mom. A tutor is the last thing I want right now—until I get a look at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chelsea is not my type at all. She’s smart and totally shy. I’m pretty sure she’s even a virgin. But when she gives me the once over with those piercing blue eyes, I’m really over. But in a different way. I won’t deny her ass is killer, but it’s her brain and the way she seems to crave love—like no one’s ever given her any—that make me want her more than any girl I’ve ever met. But what would someone as seemingly together as her ever see in a screwed up guy like me?</description>

  <description>Monica Murphy returns with her most beloved characters, Drew and Fable, in this eBook original 40,000-word novella that brings her bestselling New Adult series full circle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fantasy. How I ended up with NFL player Drew Callahan, the guy every woman wants, is beyond my wildest dreams. All I know is that once he chose me as his one and only, I sure wasn’t looking back. I had past wounds and he showed patience and concern—even taking responsibility for my messed-up kid brother. Now, once again, he’s found a way to blow my mind: an exotic wedding and honeymoon miles and miles away from home. What else could a girl ever ask for?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reality. Now the honeymoon’s over. Drew’s football schedule takes him on the road constantly, while I need to stay put and look after my brother until he finishes high school—because God knows our sorry excuse for a mother won’t. I know Drew loves me with all his heart, and I’ll always be over the moon about him. This just isn’t how I imagined our life as newlyweds . . . dealing with the distance, missing him all the time. But we’ve gone through hard times before. We can get through this, too, right? We’re Drew and Fable, together forever. At least I hope so. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Breakout New Adult sensation Monica Murphy returns with a hot new contemporary romance—a heartfelt story of second chances, forgiveness, and redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commitment.&lt;/i&gt; That’s what I really want from Colin. Ever since my brother, Danny, died in Iraq, Colin’s done so much to help me, including giving me a job at his popular restaurant so I can leave my crappy waitressing job at the strip joint. But lying in bed with him every night to comfort him from his horrible nightmares isn’t enough anymore. I know he feels guilty about Danny’s death, about not going to Iraq, but I can’t keep living this double life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love him desperately, but he’s got so many demons, and if he can’t open up to me now, then he’ll never be the real partner I need him to be. I gave him a month, and now I’m out of here. If he truly loves me like he says, he knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>It’s not easy being the bad guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that’s a lie. It’s pretty damn simple. You act and you own it. You sell your soul to protect those you love and screw the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the restraint that’s hard. The demons that poke at your trigger, burn in your gut—just waiting for a second of freedom to unleash the fire in your soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me a villain. Call me whatever helps you sleep at night and feel good about the black and white of love. But watch your back because I don’t care. Until I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I implode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: VIPER directly follows the action in Tracing Holland (NSB #2), but can also be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Book 2 of the NSB Series. ** A 2016 RT Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second chances are hard enough when you deserve them. Then there are the ones you don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callie asked if I was ready. And that’s the question, isn’t it? Ready for what? The spotlight? The music? Or ready for life. Ready to face the reality that what I was is going to attack the very fabric of who I am now. No one knows I’m a different person. Well, no one except the two most important people in my life, which is why there’s a remote chance I might actually pull off the comeback I never saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, that was before Holland Drake crashed into my life. I didn’t ask for her. Heaven knows she didn’t ask for me. But sometimes it’s not about what makes sense; it’s about accepting that not everything will. It’s learning you have a choice when it feels like you don’t. It’s believing even the worst past can still have a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes it’s none of that. Sometimes it’s survival. A blind fight through the pain as you cling to any shred of hope you can find. And it’s those moments, those desperate pleas into the darkness for a flicker of light, when you have no choice but to confront the blessing that often feels like a curse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re still alive. You’re still significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re once again Luke Craven, frontman for Night Shifts Black.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The biggest fight of his life isn’t . . . In the Ring.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright lights. The roaring crowd. The chance at a championship belt. &lt;i&gt;The not-so-little secret Liam Shaughnessy—the Bonny Bruiser—is fighting to keep tucked far away.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam got the pussy pounded out of him on the mean streets of Cin-city—the other Sin City. The oldest in a Catholic clan where his da never pulled any punches, he went from geek boy to the golden boy of the boxing world care of his fists. Liam’s on the fast track to having it all . . . all except the one man he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Fairweather makes pretending to be hetero goddamn difficult for Liam. The man is blond and beautiful and just so happens to be Liam’s trainer. With a penchant for doing shirtless yoga, giving midnight massages to loosen Liam’s muscles, and sometimes even taking it out in the ring with him. To say Liam has porn-style fantasies about Michael is an understatement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael’s out and proud. Liam’s only proud of what he can do in the ring. He can’t risk his career, least of all for someone unavailable. Michael has a lover. Liam has the lies he lives every day. And when his money-grubbing manager gets involved as the title win approaches, Liam doesn’t know what hit him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight to win. Fight with honor. It won’t be easy, but that’s okay. Nothing worth fighting for ever is.</description>

  <description>From the USA Today and Internationally bestselling author of The Club Series, Hero, and Captain, Lauren Rowe, comes a sexy &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; romantic comedy about Keane Morgan: &lt;i&gt;Ball Peen Hammer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keane Morgan wouldn’t return any of my calls or texts, and I was pissed as hell about it. I didn’t want to drive from Seattle to L.A. with the guy any more than he wanted to drive with me, but I had no frickin’ choice in the matter--at least, not if I wanted to use his brother Dax’s coveted parking spot at UCLA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it turned out Keane was objectively gorgeous, and, fine, pretty funny, too. But did he have to be so damned &lt;i&gt;in love&lt;/i&gt; with himself? I mean, jeez, the cocky way he flashed those dimples was just so &lt;i&gt;orchestrated.&lt;/i&gt; And, honestly, what kind of guy uses the phrase “baby doll” with a straight face? Oh, that’s right: &lt;i&gt;the kind of guy who’s a male stripper.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, the cocky jerk turned out to be Seattle’s answer to Magic Mike, a stripper known as “Ball Peen Hammer”--which meant Keane Morgan was emphatically &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the kind of guy I’d ever fall for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not. At. All.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No freakin’ way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, until Keane convinced me to fall for him, that is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hard.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;Ball Peen Hammer is a full-length, standalone sexy romantic comedy about Keane Morgan (one of four Morgan brothers introduced in The Club Series) and Maddy Milliken (the little sister of Hannah Banana Montana Milliken). This book is a standalone book in The Morgan Brothers Series, a spin-off of THE CLUB SERIES, and can be read as a complete standalone. The Morgan Brothers books are intended to be read in any order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From, Lauren Rowe, the USA Today and International bestselling author of The Club Series, Hero, and Ball Peen Hammer comes a sexy standalone romance about Ryan . Morgan: Captain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t the way this kind of story was supposed to go . . .&lt;br /&gt;Insta-love isn’t supposed to turn into insta-hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s exactly what happened when the hot-as-hell dreamboat I met in a bar turned out to be a lying, cheating scumbag-player-douche looking for nothing but a little side action. Jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he has the nerve to call me a liar and a “sociopath”? Assh*le.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, three months later, through a mind-blowing series of events I couldn’t have predicted in a million years, it turns out my boss is marrying his sister in Hawaii and I’ve got to play nice with him for an entire freaking week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, sure, I’ll put on a happy face this week and act like I’ve never even met the jerk before--did I mention his sister is marrying my boss?--but that doesn’t mean I’ll like it. And it certainly doesn’t mean I’ll stop secretly hating the cocky bastard’s guts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I do.&lt;br /&gt;I hate him. &lt;br /&gt;I really do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish my brain would explain the situation to my body . . . because every time he flashes that panty-melting smile at me, it takes all my self-restraint not to jump the bastard’s hot-as-f*ck bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE: CAPTAIN is a full-length, standalone sexy romantic comedy about Ryan Morgan (one of four Morgan brothers introduced in The Club Series). This book is a standalone book in The Morgan Brothers Series, a spin-off of THE CLUB SERIES, and can be read as a complete standalone. The Morgan Brothers books are intended to be read in any order: CAPTAIN, BALL PEEN HAMMER, and the upcoming HERO (March 12, 2018).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For fans of Ball Peen Hammer, please note Captain features Ryan Morgan and takes place one year before the events of Ball Peen Hammer, but can be read before or after that book.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I named myself. I took the word &lt;i&gt;animal&lt;/i&gt; out of their mouths, wore it like a badge of honor, then shoved it down their throats. I've fought for what I have. I see you coming before you even know you want a piece of me. In a city riddled with warring families, I'll rise up between them. My people, the broken souls I gather, will have power by the time I'm done with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I protect mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Him. My brother, Nix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her. The girl that is the only home I've ever had. She knows me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm coming at you, sweetness. Stay ready.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>MACKENNA&lt;br /&gt;I have everything I need to live out my dream of being a reclusive songwriter—my guitar, my notebook, and blissful silence.&lt;br /&gt;At least, I did until Jimmy moved in next door.&lt;br /&gt;He’s got bad news written all over him. And last time I got with a bad boy, it ended with me pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;Talk about going out with a bang.&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy makes me want things I shouldn’t want, which means I have two options: avoid him or piss him off. But no matter what I do he isn't fazed, and I'm quickly realizing there's more to Jimmy than I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JIMMY&lt;br /&gt;Over the past year, I’ve been called a lot of things. Slacker. Troublemaker. Party animal.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was on top of the world. Turns out, I was pretty close to rock bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a new title: college dropout.&lt;br /&gt;But I’ve got a chance to redeem myself—one summer of squeaky-clean behavior at Grandma Beverly’s. Two months to prove I’m not a complete f*ck-up.&lt;br /&gt;And four rules to follow with the gorgeous girl next door. Rules aren't exactly my forte, but I only plan on breaking one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I want to get back to being one of the good guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Dropout is the third book in the Good Guys series, it can be enjoyed as a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate Cover Edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33149406-dancer" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B01MTN6AUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRIELLE&lt;br /&gt;Technically, I’m not a stripper. As a cage dancer, I don’t take all my clothes off and no one gets to touch me. I’m just the eye candy.&lt;br /&gt;And I can feel their eyes on me. I know they’re watching, but I don’t do this for them.&lt;br /&gt;This is my time.&lt;br /&gt;My life may not have turned out the way I thought it would, but I’m not complaining. From 9pm to 1am several days a week I get paid to feel sexy, to feel desired, to do what I love.&lt;br /&gt;I always knew I wanted to be a dancer—I just didn’t realize I’d be doing it in a cage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLTON&lt;br /&gt;Erectile dysfunction—two words that can cause a collective cringe from men everywhere. The doctors can call it ‘performance anxiety’ all they want, but that’s just a fancy way of saying my dick doesn’t work.&lt;br /&gt;Just when I start to think there’s no hope for me, I see her. She’s gorgeous, sexy, and goofy as f*ck. She also looks really familiar but I can’t put my finger on it.&lt;br /&gt;When I find out who she really is, my world is turned upside down and everything seems to fall into place.&lt;br /&gt;She’s not gonna make it easy for me, but I’ve never been one to back down from a challenge. She’s convinced I won’t stick around.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll prove her wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll show her I’m one of the good guys.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Please note: A Trucker Christmas is not a standalone. &lt;i&gt;Trucker&lt;/i&gt; must be read first to enjoy this novella.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five chapters for charity! Find out how Travis and Angel spend their first Christmas together while also donating to a good cause. Half of the profits from A Trucker Christmas will go toward the Bristol Peterson medical fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to language and sexual content, this book is intended for readers 18 and older.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“What do you do when you meet your soul mate? No wait…that’s too easy. What do you do when you meet your soul mate and have to spend a lifetime loving him in secret? &lt;br /&gt;I’ll tell you what you do.&lt;br /&gt;You lie.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;REN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren was eight when he learned that love doesn’t exist—that the one person who was supposed to adore him only cared how much he was worth. &lt;br /&gt;His mother sold him and for two years, he lived in terror.&lt;br /&gt;But then…he ran.&lt;br /&gt;He thought he’d run on his own. Turned out, he took something of theirs by accident and it became the one thing he never wanted and the only thing he ever needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DELLA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was young when I fell in love with him, when he switched from my world to my everything. &lt;br /&gt;My parents bought him for cheap labour, just like they had with many other kids, and he had the scars to prove it. &lt;br /&gt;At the start, he hated me, and I could understand why.&lt;br /&gt;For years he was my worst enemy, fiercest protector, and dearest friend.&lt;br /&gt;But by the end…he loved me.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was, he loved me in an entirely different way to the way I loved him.&lt;br /&gt;And slowly, my secret drove us apart.</description>

  <description>Dear Isaiah,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight months ago, you were just a soldier about to be deployed and I was just a waitress, sneaking you free pancakes and hoping you wouldn’t notice that my gaze was lingering a little too long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you did notice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent a “week of Saturdays” together before you left, and we said goodbye on day eight, exchanging addresses at the last minute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved every letter you ever sent, your words quickly becoming my religion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you went radio silent on me months ago, and then you had the audacity to walk into my diner yesterday and act like you’d never seen me in your life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To think … I almost loved you and your beautifully complicated soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your reason is—I hope it’s a good one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maritza the Waitress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS – I hate you, and this time … I mean it.</description>

      <![CDATA[I've read a few of Winter Renshaw's other books, and this one looked interesting from the blurb so I gave it a go. All in all it was an ok read. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, it was just ok. <br /><br />I think the thing that really brought down this book for me was the main heroine Maritza. Her charac...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From the &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;b&gt;Sweet Ache &lt;/b&gt;comes a blistering new novel filled with danger, secrecy, and a desire that can’t be sated…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foreign war correspondent Tanner Thomas is addicted to living on the edge. Needing the adrenaline rush of his job to help him cope with a personal loss, he throws himself back into the game, concentrating all his energy on getting the next big story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he meets his new photojournalist, Beaux Croslyn, he can’t help but feel like he’s losing his focus—and maybe risking more…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With secrets she won’t address, Beaux is far from your ordinary woman. Determined to keep her distance, she’s willing to pull Tanner in closer and hide behind the sparks flying between them. But as Beaux’s past begins to put their relationship—and their lives—at risk, Tanner’s determination to find the truth puts them both in jeopardy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's ready to chase her to the ends of the earth to find out if what they had was real, or if the danger surrounding them was just an exquisite heat fated to burn out…</description>

I really enjoyed this story. <br /><br />Tanner and Beaux were great characters. I loved the story and the plot twists. Definitely an action packed...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Slow Burn&lt;/i&gt; turns up the heat when a sexy bet turns into so much more…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hawkin Play,&lt;/b&gt; the bad boy rock star with a good guy heart, has lived a lifetime of cleaning up after his twin brother’s mistakes. Hunter’s most recent screw-up could land Hawke in jail and risk the band’s future. Hawke agrees to guest lecture at a local college to stay in the judge’s good graces—and a bet with his bandmate to seduce his sexy teaching assistant is icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quinlan Westin&lt;/b&gt; is harder to bed than Hawke imagined. She knows his type and is determined to avoid the rocker at all costs—even if their attraction runs deeper than simple lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Hawke might finally be winning over the girl, his brother has other plans. When Hunter realizes his twin finally has a weakness, he’ll stop at nothing to take advantage…</description>

I was actually going to give this one a 2 star, but the story was able to squeak back up to a 3 (barely). <br /><br />I think...]]>

That's all it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reeling from the sudden loss of her sister, Haddie Montgomery has sworn off relationships. All she wanted from Beckett Daniels was a sexy distraction to help her escape her pain for just a little while....There weren’t supposed to be any strings attached—so why can’t she shake the memory of that unforgettable night from her thoughts? Or the taste of his kiss from her lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No matter how hard Haddie tries to forget about him, Becks relentlessly tries to prove that she should start living for today. But she is determined to avoid romantic commitment, and she can always use her ex-boyfriend’s reappearance to help snuff out the &lt;i&gt;slow burn&lt;/i&gt; within her that Becks has sparked....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Or will fate force her to realize that this kind of connection doesn’t come along very often and a chance at love is worth the risk?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=9780989450232" title="9780989450232" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780989450232&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when the one person you never expected suddenly happens to be the one you’ll fight the hardest to keep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton stole my heart. He wasn't supposed to, and I sure as hell didn't want him to, but he crashed into my life, ignited feelings within me that I thought had died forever, and fueled a passion that I never knew could exist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rylee fell out of that damn storage closet and into my life. Now I don't think I'll ever be the same. She's seen glimpses of the darkness within me, and yet she's still here. Still fighting for me. She is without a doubt the saint, and I am most definitely the sinner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How is it the one thing neither of us wanted—neither of us anticipated that fateful night—has us fighting so hard to keep?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He steals my breath, stops my heart, and brings me back to life again all in a split second of time. But how can I love a man who won't let me in? Who continually pushes me away to prevent me from seeing the damaged secrets in his past? My heart has fallen, but patience and forgiveness can only go so far.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can I desire a woman who unnerves me, defies me, and forces me to see that in the deep, black abyss of my soul there's someone worthy of her love? A place and person I swore I'd never be again. Her selfless heart and sexy body deserve so much more than I'll ever be capable of giving her. I know I can't be what she needs, so why can't I just let her go?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We are driven by need and fueled with desire, but is that enough for us to crash into love?</description>

  <description>A standalone contemporary romance in the MORGAN BROTHERS SERIES from USA Today Bestselling Author Lauren Rowe. The story of firefighter Colby Morgan that proves heroes come in many forms . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I laid eyes on Lydia Decker, I couldn’t speak. Or breathe. Or string two coherent thoughts together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don’t mean any of that figuratively. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not talking about a guy being floored by the sight of a gorgeous woman—although, of course, Lydia is gorgeous beyond words. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, when I first laid eyes on Lydia Decker—my physical therapist—I was lying flat on my back in the ICU, high as a kite on painkillers, breathing on a ventilator, my bones as broken and splintered as my spirit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first laid eyes on Lydia Decker, she was a ray of light in the dark. Hope for the hopeless. A salve for my singed and battered soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said she’d been assigned to fix me. That she was there to bring me back to life. She said helping me was her calling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she touched me. Physically, emotionally, spiritually. She healed me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I didn’t know... what I couldn’t possibly know... was that Lydia Decker needed fixing far more than I ever did.</description>

(Which I'm glad that I did, because the timelines of book #2 and 3 coincide, but book #1 takes place AFTER Book #2 and #3, so it actually worked out.)<br /><br />I LOVED Colby!

  <description>“There’s no better wolf than a dead one.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound of cars makes my heart beat faster. The sight of a bitumen road gives me hope. The faces of my family waiting for me are all I can see as I battle to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t look back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t cry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight, Morgan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the Wolf, and I’m the thirteenth woman he has called his Red. This is his last chance to scratch my name from the list of bitches who’ve wronged him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he claim my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m coming for you, Red. It’s time to die. – The Wolf</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow! What an ending to such an amazing series! I was completely clueless to who the wolf actually was, and the entire series was mind boggling the whole ride through. It has been a very suspenseful and nail biting journey. Definitely recommend this book to anyone that loves a good suspense thrill...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Most people called it a cult. But for twenty years, Josh and Caleb called it home. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Paradise, there is no television. No fast food. Just long hours of farm work and prayer on a dusty Wyoming ranch, and nights in a crowded bunkhouse. The boys of the Compound are kept far from the sinners’ world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Joshua doesn’t need temptation to sin. His whole life, he’s wanted his best friend, Caleb. By day they work side by side. Only when Josh closes his eyes at night can they be together the way he craves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can never be. And his survival depends on keeping his terrible desires secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb has always protected Josh against the worst of the bullying at the Compound. But he has secrets of his own, and a plan to get away — until it all backfires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh finds himself homeless in a world that doesn’t want him. Can Caleb find him in time? And will they find a place of safety, where he can admit to Josh how he really feels? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Contains a hot male/male romance, copious instances of taking the Lord's name in vain, and love against the kitchen counter. This book was previously released under the title: In Front of God &amp;amp; Everyone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>KAYLA&lt;br /&gt;My infatuation with Ezra Johnson started how all obsessions begin—with a simple crush. Over the years I silently soaked up every shy smile and random act of kindness, wrestling them away to a secret place in my heart meant for unrequited love.&lt;br /&gt;Because if it wasn’t for the fact that I tutor him once a week, I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t even know I exist.&lt;br /&gt;Then I find his sketchbook.&lt;br /&gt;And it changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EZRA&lt;br /&gt;There are two certainties in my life: I’ve been in love with Kayla Reynolds since I was fourteen, and I can’t have her.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent years settling for a two-dimensional fantasy world, capturing her beauty with a pencil and paper. She’s kind, smart, gorgeous…&lt;br /&gt;And she belongs to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;An interesting turn of events makes me realize things aren’t always how they appear on the outside, and now I’ve got my chance to be the man she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember, I’ve been called a loser. The cripple. An outcast.&lt;br /&gt;But maybe—just maybe—this time the good guy won’t finish last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Releasing March 15th, 2018 ***</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SUBJECT: I’m sorry (Marked Confidential)&lt;br /&gt;From the Desk of His Royal Highness Prince Robert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aly—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t stop thinking about tonight. Why is it that the sex is so good even though we hate each other so much? We say it will never happen again. Still, I can’t resist having you against the wall in our office every time I see you. But tonight I sense that you are serious about us NEVER. HAPPENING. AGAIN. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have your new bloke. And I’m…me. The playboy prince. The one not expected to settle down. But staying away from you is already killing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a good man. But for the first time, I wish I were. Maybe then I’d deserve you. &lt;br /&gt;You’re gorgeous. Clever. You call me out on my bulls**t. No one treats me the way you do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore you, sweetheart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m sorry I never had the balls to tell you this to your face. But tonight, it’s the whiskey talking...as they say, a drunk man’s words are a sober man’s thoughts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xx, Rob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The books in the THORNE MONARCHS series are STANDALONE stories and can be read in any order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL RUIN: Kit &amp;amp; Emily’s book&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL REBEL: Rob &amp;amp; Aly’s book&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL ROGUE: Charlie &amp;amp; Jane’s book&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>London is a city in flames. Tensions are high and a critical situation is about to go from bad to worse. The Prime Minister wants to send a message, and the SAS will be the ones to deliver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotional detachment is my speciality. I’m ruthless and cut throat, but there is nobody better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Tatem is an innocent. Caught up in a world in which she doesn’t belong, and trying desperately to do the right thing. My job is to keep her safe long enough to get what’s needed, and bring an end to this siege of terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something has changed. I’ve learned that the only thing stronger than loyalty is love, and now she’s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Lieutenant Tom Harper, and I’m about to unleash hell.</description>

  <description>He came back to me 16 minutes and 59 seconds into Beethoven’s Symphony no. 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We parted amid tragedy, so it seemed poetic. Dylan O’Dea, my childhood sweetheart, had once meant everything to me. Now we were strangers, and honestly, after eleven years I never thought I’d see him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lived in the world of the average, of getting paid by the hour and budgeting to make ends meet. But Dylan, he lived in the world of wealth and success. He’d achieved the great things I always suspected he would. The dissatisfaction he’d felt as a teenager had obviously been an excellent motivator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started a business from scratch, pioneered a brand, and created perfumes adored by women across the globe. I was just one of the people who’d been there before. Now he was living his best life in the after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And me, well, I’d been in a dark place for a while. Slowly but surely, I was letting the light back in, but there was something missing. I was an unfinished sentence with an ellipsis at the end. And maybe, if I was brave enough to take the chance, Dylan could be my happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the Light Gets In is Book #2 and the concluding instalment in L.H. Cosway’s Cracks duet.</description>

  <description>Life used to be simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a city girl with humble dreams. Then Dylan O’Dea broke into my flat, held me against the wall and told me to stay quiet.&lt;br /&gt;It was like in the movies, where the universe zeros in on a single scene. I looked into his eyes and knew he was going to change me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Dylan, the sky was always falling. He showed me how our world is a contradiction of beauty and ugliness. How we choose to ignore the awful and gloss over it with the palatable. How you need just a tiny drop of something unsavoury to create every great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty deep for a pair of teenagers living in a block of council flats in inner city Dublin, right? Probably. But we weren’t typical. We both had our obsessions. Mine was growing things, Dylan’s was scent. He taught me how to use my nose, and I introduced him to the magic of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that one day he’d build an empire from what we started together. But before that, there was love and happiness, tragedy and epic heartbreak…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Evelyn Flynn and I’m going to tell you about the crack in everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Crack in Everything is Book #1 in L.H. Cosway’s Cracks duet.</description>

  <description>(formerly titled Cockpit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author K. Bromberg comes a new, sexy standalone about taking chances and finding love when it’s least expected. &lt;i&gt;Or wanted.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole contest was supposed to be easy. &lt;i&gt;I know, I know. &lt;/i&gt;Famous last words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a long story, but I messed up at work. &lt;i&gt;Big time.&lt;/i&gt; To earn back the trust of my boss, I promised to save one of our magazines. Yep. That &lt;i&gt;Hot Dad&lt;/i&gt; contest you’ve seen advertised all over the place was my idea. And if I’m successful, if I’m able to increase our online readership, then I get a shot at my dream job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the one thing I never expected to happen, happened: Contestant number ten, Grayson Malone. &lt;i&gt;Hello, Mr. Difficult.&lt;/i&gt; And did I mention sexy as hell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately he knows me. The old me, anyway. And while we might be older now, I remind him of &lt;i&gt;before.&lt;/i&gt; Of the woman who broke his heart, who hardened him, and who left him alone to raise the cutest little boy I’ve ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don’t want a relationship. And I definitely don’t fall for single dads with baggage. Even ones with chiseled abs and killer smiles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;he got to me. They got to me.&lt;/i&gt; Him and his son and their messy, crazy life. But I got to him too. I see the stolen glances. I feel the walls he built start to crumble. I recognize that there’s an unexpected beauty to the chaos in his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that the contest is about to end, we’re left to decide whether the last six months were just fun or if what we have is worth risking it all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestselling&lt;/i&gt; author, K. Bromberg, comes a new standalone book. &lt;i&gt;Just how hot will firefighter Grady Malone turn up the heat?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songwriter Dylan McCoy has been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her boyfriend she found in her bed... with &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the contract she signed that obligates her to work with him until the songs for his new album are complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her agent when she asked Dylan to keep their breakup on the down-low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she finds herself in Sunnyville, she refuses to let her new roommate burn her too. Still... &lt;i&gt;a rebound has never looked so good.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s her first thought when she sees firefighter Grady Malone. Sexy. Charismatic. Unapologetic. He’s a man who carries his own scars — the ones on his back, the survivor’s guilt on his soul, and the fear in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unexpected visitor puts their roommate status to the test, will their undeniable attraction burn out, or will they both take a chance and play with fire?</description>

  <description>**Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content and language, mature subject matter**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Adult Contemporary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost. That one single word best describes my life at this very moment. I lost the last games of the season and both my team and my coach blame me. I lost the last two months because I drowned in my own despair like a complete loser. And I lost the only girl who ever mattered because I was afraid being with me would destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I realize how truly lost I am without her. She has become my story…and even though she acts like she’s moved on, I know she still thinks about me just as much as I think about her. She’s beautiful, sweet—and so damn vulnerable, all I want to do is help her. Be there for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I could convince Fable to give me a second chance. Then I wouldn’t feel so lost anymore, and neither would she. We could be found together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>Temporary. That one single word best describes my life these last few years. I’m working at a temporary job until I can finally break free. I’m my little brother’s temporary mother since our mom doesn’t give a crap about either of us. And I’m that temporary girl all the guys want to get with because I give it up so easily. According to the rumors, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I’m the temporary girlfriend of Drew Callahan, college football legend and all around golden guy. He’s beautiful, sweet—and he’s hiding way more secrets than I am. He’s brought me into this fake life where everyone seems to hate me. And everyone seems to want something from him. The only thing he seems to want though is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what to believe anymore. All I know is, I think Drew needs me. And I want to be there for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>When Drix was convicted of a crime--one he didn't commit--he thought his life was over. But opportunity came with the new Second Chance Program, the governor's newest pet project to get delinquents off the streets, rehabilitated and back into society. Drix knows this is his chance to get his life back on track, even if it means being paraded in front of reporters for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle knows she lives a life of privilege. As the governor's daughter, she can open doors with her name alone. But the expectations and pressure to be someone she isn't may be too much to handle. She wants to follow her own path, whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Drix and Elle meet, their connection is immediate, but so are their problems. Drix is not the type of boy Elle's parents have in mind for her, and Elle is not the kind of girl who can understand Drix's messy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes love can breach all barriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting against a society that can't imagine them together, Drix and Elle must push themselves--Drix to confront the truth of the robbery, and Elle to assert her independence--and each other to finally get what they deserve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author, K. Bromberg, comes a new standalone that proves true love will always stand the test of time. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I hate you. I never want to see you again.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant Malone is not the reason I moved back to Sunnyville—at least that’s what I tell myself. Yet, those parting words I said to him back in third grade, ring in my ears every time a townsperson brings up one of the Malone boys. I thought time had healed my wounds. &lt;i&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/i&gt; Nothing could have prepared me for how I felt when I finally saw him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years does a lot to turn a boy into a man. One who hits all my buttons—sexy, funny, attractive, and a police officer. But Grant is off limits because he knows too much about my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But I’m drawn to him.&lt;/i&gt; That damn uniform of his doesn’t hurt either. It’ll be my downfall. I know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s one night of sex going to hurt . . . right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve always loved Emmy Reeves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s why I’m shocked to see her all these years later. The shy girl I once knew is all grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adventurous and full of life, she owns my heart now, just as much as she did back then. Convincing her of that is a whole different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll give her the one night she asks for—&lt;i&gt;like that’s a hardship&lt;/i&gt;—but when it comes to letting her walk away after, she has another thing coming. There’s no way in hell I’m letting her go this time without a fight.</description>

  <description>Seven years. &lt;br /&gt; Seven damn years of wondering whether the woman was still alive whether she d spent the last two thousand five hundred fifty five days wondering if he was still alive. &lt;br /&gt; Wondering whether that night was as burned into her memory as it was his. &lt;br /&gt; Seven years having his heart tethered to Addison and now she s back. With even more reasons to run than she d had then. &lt;br /&gt; Only this time, Caine isn t letting the gorgeous little flight risk out of his sight. &lt;br /&gt; Regardless of how noble her reasons may be. EVERY NIGHT WITHOUT YOU (Bk 2) takes place seven years after BEFORE THAT NIGHT (Bk 1), and is the conclusion of Caine &amp;amp; Addison s story of love, sacrifice, and the lengths one will run and chase when their past threatens their future."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy new standalone from USA Today bestseller Sarina Bowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d think a billion dollars, a professional hockey team and a six-bedroom mansion on the Promenade would satisfy a guy. You’d be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seven years Rebecca has brightened my office with her wit and her smile. She manages both my hockey team and my sanity. I don’t know when I started waking in the night, craving her. All I know is that one whiff of her perfume ruins my concentration. And her laugh makes me hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rebecca gets hurt, I step in to help. It’s what friends do. But what friends don’t do is rip off each others’ clothes for a single, wild night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s avoiding me. She says we’re too different, and it can never happen again. So why can’t we keep our hands off each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tyler Holiday (Ta-hoe)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tahoe. Badass. SEAL. Player. Powerful. Jerk. Available. &lt;br /&gt;All words used to describe me for the past ten years. Wrapped up in the war, running and gunning constantly, has taken its toll on me. My next assignment is supposed to be a break, something to aid in taking the edge off; help open a new base in the miniscule, coastal, Florida town of Bronze Bay. A non-deployable position, I can work-out, decompress, and handle the mundane tasks of structuring a new SEAL command. Or, in other words, enjoy my free time with the tanned, toned, country women of the south. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mission accepted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling for a southern belle wasn’t supposed to happen. In fact, it’s more stressing than any challenge in my sordid past. Especially when she uttered the words, “I am a virgin.” &lt;br /&gt;Someone cover me, I’m going in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caroline May&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first memory is in an airplane over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. My daddy sitting beside me and my heart full of joy. When I was sixteen, I made my first solo flight over those exact same waters. My daddy owns and operates the little airport in Bronze Bay, so my eyes have been skyward for as long as I can remember. Things like men and college, never appealed to me. My days are spent waitressing in my Mama’s diner, counting down the hours until I can head to the airport. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the SEALs came and changed everything. Big, brutal, jerks, forcing themselves into our little slice of paradise. Demanding use of our airport. One man in particular, aiming to take more than I’m ready to give. He is beautiful. Magnetic. Strong. Convincing. For the first time in my life, I’m flying in a different, exhilarating way. Keeping it isn’t going to be easy when merely looking at the man makes me think of four words. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxtrot. Uniform. Charlie. Kilo.&lt;br /&gt;Bless my heart, I’m in trouble.</description>

  <description>"The Wolf can break my bones, but he can't destroy my heart."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never lie down and say die because there are four hearts that beat for me, including my own, and it's the strongest weapon I have. I will defeat the Wolf. I will take his life. He'd better sleep with one eye open, because I'm coming for him.&lt;br /&gt;Who is the Wolf? He's one dead son-of-a-bitch in my eyes. He underestimated me and now he has no clue where I am. I've found my place to hide, and it's only a matter of time until I see my freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, burn in hell, Red, because I've had enough." - The Wolf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game isn't over yet. For me, it's just begun.</description>

  <description>“The Wolf has played me for a fool.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve no clue who is hunting me, but he demands I complete his tests. I fear if I can’t figure out his identity, he’ll kill me just like he said. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His eyes were blue the last time I looked into them, but now when he glares at me they’re green. Is the Wolf playing dress up? Or are there two monsters who have stolen me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Did you think I’d make this easy for you, Red? Are you ready to play again?” – The Wolf &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want out of this nightmare, and the only way to do that is to win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I need to win. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Look, but don’t touch…she might as well wear a neon sign that says it. It just makes me want her more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She might be above me in every way, but I still want her under me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve got no business touching her rich-girl skin, but that won’t stop me from stealing a taste. Because rules were meant to be broken—especially when the prize is so fine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world where nothing is as it seems, what's buried beneath these lies?</description>

  <description>I was raised on the streets, so I know things are rarely as simple as they appear—especially this rich girl showing up at my pawnshop demanding a job.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the most tempting thing I’ve ever seen, and I’ll be damned if I can make her leave.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shit just got complicated … but when it comes to her—I want complicated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re both fighting our own demons, and our only chance at a future is to let go of the past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But will we be strong enough to break free from beneath these chains?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEATH THESE CHAINS may be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>From author Meghan March comes a &lt;b&gt;sexy new standalone&lt;/b&gt; in the Beneath series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to fall in love with the villain? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the guy you love to hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every story in my life, I seem to end up playing the villain—and I’ve got the scars to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That role works fine for me, because I’m sure as hell not anyone’s hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run my life and my empire with an iron fist—until she knocks my tightly controlled world off its axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s nobody’s damsel in distress, but I can’t help but want to save her anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we’re about to find out if there’s a hero buried beneath these scars.</description>

  <description>I’ve always known she was too good for me, but that never stopped me from wanting her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I finally had her for one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A night I don’t remember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I’d blown my shot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now she’s walked back into my life, and this time, I have the upper hand. I want my second chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she be able to see the man beneath this ink?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SUBJECT: Engagement Contract (Marked Confidential)&lt;br /&gt;From The Desk of His Royal Highness Prince Christopher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Emily, &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for joining me for dinner tonight. And for agreeing to my proposal, as ludicrous as it is. Desperate times call for fake engagements. At least in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching the contract we discussed. Our lawyers asked that I highlight the following clauses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;•The engagement shall last ninety days&lt;br /&gt;•Both parties are to appear genuinely in love at all royal appearances&lt;br /&gt;•Beyond required public displays of affection, there shall be no contact of any kind between the parties&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first half of your payment will be deposited into your account upon the signing of this contract. Be sure to note your ring size. We would like to make prompt delivery of the family emerald. The Queen and I thank you in advance for your discretion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Royal Highness Prince Christopher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.—Sorry to hear about your divorce. Your ex sounds like a proper knob head.&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S—You looked stunning tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The books in the THORNE MONARCHS series are STANDALONE stories and can be read in any order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL RUIN: Kit &amp;amp; Emily’s book&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL REBEL: Rob &amp;amp; Aly’s book&lt;br /&gt;ROYAL ROGUE: Charlie &amp;amp; Jane’s book&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Royal romance is definitely not a genre I normally read, but because I have loved all of Jessica Peterson’s other books I had to read her newest release.<br /><br />I’ve got to say, I really and truly enjoyed it. I really loved Emily and Kits story. The characters were great, the pacing of the st...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He puts the "screw" in screwball comedy...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRYNN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-four, I’m reeling from a divorce. I don’t want to party or try to move on. I just want to stay home and post a new recipe on my blog: &lt;i&gt;Brynn’s Dips and Balls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my friends aren’t having it. &lt;i&gt;Get out there again,&lt;/i&gt; they say. &lt;i&gt;It will be fun,&lt;/i&gt; they say. I’m still taking a hard pass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free designer cocktails,&lt;/i&gt; they say. And that’s a game-changer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad my ex shows up with his new arm candy. That’s when I lose my mind. But when my besties dare me to leap on the first single man I see, they don't expect me to actually go through with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I need right now is some peace and quiet while my home renovation TV show is on hiatus. But when a curvy woman in a red wrap dress charges me like she’s a gymnast about to mount my high bar, all I can do is brace myself and catch her. What follows is the hottest experience of my adult life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a repeat, but my flying Cinderella disappears immediately afterward. She doesn’t leave a glass slipper, either—just a pair of panties with chocolate bunnies printed on them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; find her.</description>

  <description>Zoey Handler is ready to put an end to her decade-long rivalry with Gordon Meyers. They’ve traded top spot between valedictorian and salutatorian for years, but all that’s over now. Right? But after a crazy graduation speech prank gets out of hand, suddenly their rivalry turns into all-out war. Time to make peace with a little friendly payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one? Make him believe they’re now friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two? Show him the time of his life at an epic graduation party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step three? Don’t fall for his tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step four? Absolutely, positively, do not kiss him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if he’s cute? (Okay, hot.) So what if he’s charming? (Heaven help her, tempting.) So what if he apologizes? (That has to be fake.) She knows the real Gordon. And no matter how much her heart begs her to stop, there’s no turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains one epic party, complete with every high-schoolers-gone-bad shenanigan, and two rivals who discover maybe they could be something much more…if only they’d stop fighting long enough to notice it.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the mother’s former nurse, the little half-brother isn’t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there’s Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn’t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her—until she discovers that he’s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that she’s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.</description>

  <description>When I was nineteen years old, I was faced with a choice that changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the safety of what I already knew or risk losing everything with the young, hotheaded soldier who stole my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the wrong man, and for seventeen years, I paid in tears, blood, and shattered dreams for that decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there’s a man in my house, holding a gun to my head on the order of my ex-husband—given from his prison cell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hotheaded soldier I was too afraid to choose? He’s now a six-foot-three wall of muscle who works at the country’s most premier bodyguard agency. I’ve always wanted him, but now, I’ve never needed him more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the call I’m terrified to make. &lt;br /&gt;I’m sure he still hates me… Even though I’ve never stopped loving him.</description>

      <![CDATA[I was really excited for the second book in the Guardian series, but this one just fell short for me. <br /><br />I didn’t like how Mira and Jeremy’s relationship started out when they were younger, or how Mira was just walked all over and never stood up for herself. Also it was annoying when she was throwin...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A good girl trying to find herself.&lt;br /&gt;A troubled boy running from his past.&lt;br /&gt;The seductive allure of the cirque.&lt;br /&gt;One summer that will change them both forever …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old ballerina Ariel is determined to experience life outside the dance studio. She auditions for the cirque on a whim, and though ballet training didn’t prepare her for dodging knives, she refuses to flinch and wins the spot of target girl alongside Gabriel, the mysterious knife-thrower. There’s something unmistakably dangerous yet tempting about Gabriel’s crystal blue eyes and tattoos. She’s determined to solve the mystery of his past after learning he’s on the run from the law. Especially since the distraction is just what she needs to avoid admitting to her parents she was dismissed from her ballet contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more she learns about Gabriel, the scars on his body, the foster homes he grew up in, and his fascination with knives, she knows she should run the other way, but that boy’s like crack, oh so bad for you, yet addicting as hell. When he’s arrested and forced to deal with his past, she has to choose between putting her own life back together and dealing with her parents, or taking a chance on Gabriel, as no one else has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cirque is a contemporary new adult romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two worlds collide when the circus comes to Victorian-era Virginia. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised amid the fame and mystique of the Big Top, Charlie Lionheart holds the audience in the palm of his hand. But while his act captivates thousands, it’s away from the spotlight where his true heart lies. Here he humbly cares for his pride of lions as if they were his brothers, a skill of bravery and strength that has prepared him for his most challenging feat yet—freeing an orphaned infant from the dark bondage of a sideshow. A trade so costly, it requires his life in exchange for hers, leaving him tarnished by the price of that choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the circus tents are raised on the outskirts of Roanoke, nurse Ella Beckley arrives to tend to this Gypsy girl. All under the watchful eye of a guardian who not only bears a striking resemblance to the child, but who protects the baby with a love that wraps around Ella’s own tragic past, awakening a hope that goodness may yet reign. When their forbidden friendship deepens, Charlie dares to ask for her heart, bringing her behind the curtain of his secret world to reveal the sacrifice that gave hope to one little girl—boldly showing Ella that while her tattered faith is deeply scarred, the only marks that need be permanent are his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just then a child in the row behind Ella cried out, “Look, Mama!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie, dressed in his center ring finery, strode into the arena, as strong and strapping as ever. Face powdered and painted with two jagged teardrops under his eyes, he walked with stoic authority, tall boots forging a fresh trail straight toward his audience. Ella didn’t know a single man could hush a packed house with no words, but…then there was Charlie Lionheart.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Crank is a standalone romance in a new small town, blue-collar series from USA Today bestselling author Adriana Locke. Join readers everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson Boys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one mistake Sienna Landry can’t buy her way out of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Walker Gibson looks at her, then at the damage to his precious truck (that she may or may not have accidentally inflicted), she knows she’s in trouble. It’s not the busted headlight and dented grill that’s sunk her though. It’s the downright sinful man in front of her that’s the problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The small town mechanic is broody. Rough. Smells like engine grease and gasoline and Sienna isn’t sure why that’s so sexy, but it is. It so is. She’s ready to peel off her panties at the drop of his wrench. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants her too. She can feel it when he brushes against her. Experience it as he presses her against the wall of the shop. It’s thinly veiled in his deep, brown eyes when he looks at her like she’s everything he’s ever wanted. So why won’t he give in? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The damage to Walker’s truck is the first of many mistakes between the two of them, ending with truths that rock Sienna’s world. Nothing can fix her broken heart except the love of a man that won’t, maybe even can’t, love her back.</description>

And when Nick’s past comes back to haunt them both, the enigmatic doctor is more vulnerable than she seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken and betrayed, the struggle to survive seems intolerable. Who will give in, and who will rise, undefeated?</description>

  <description>“I was sure my heart had withered away years ago, but then you smiled at me, and I felt it beat again.” ~Gage &lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I fell in love with my best friend’s little brother. Then, he took his own life, leaving me shattered and unable to piece my heart back together. I’ve been a zombie for nine long years. Until a crazy, gorgeous man walked into Heathens Ink and injected color back into my world of gray. No matter how hard I try to resist Beck, he just won’t give up on me. I would need steel willpower to withstand his gorgeous long legs in those high heels and his drawer full of lacy lingerie. But is this just a kinky hook up or does it have the possibility for more? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“We’re both broken, but our jagged edges fit together well” ~ Beck &lt;br /&gt;When you’re half of a whole you never contemplate what life would be like without your matching piece. Since my twin sister, Brianna, died last year, nothing I do seems to quiet my soul. I know there has to be some way for me to feel happy and whole again. And, when I look into the pained eyes of the tattoo artist at Heathens Ink, I feel like I have a purpose. I can’t explain it, but I feel like I have to find a way to put him back together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Shattered Pieces is the fourth book in the Heathens Ink series, each book in the series CAN be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed Gage and Beck's story. Gage was still mourning losing Jonny, and Beck pulled him out of himself and showed him he could live again. It was a sweet story. I think in some parts it was a little too sweet with not enough meat to the plot, but I did enjoy the story and the characters. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A goalie has to trust his instincts, even when taking a shot to the heart…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Beacon is a champion at defending the net, but off the ice, he’s not so lucky. A widower and a single father, he’s never forgotten Lauren Williams, the ex who gave him the best year of his life. When Lauren reappears in the Bruisers office during the playoffs, Beacon sees his chance to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren hates that she’s forced to travel with the team she used to work for and the man who broke her heart. There’s still undeniable sexual tension running between her and Mike, but she won’t go down that road again. She’s focused on her plans for the future—she doesn’t need a man to make her dreams of motherhood come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren plays her best defensive game, but she’s no match for the dark-eyed goalie. When the field of play moves to Florida, things heat up on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Mike’s biggest fans doesn’t approve—his teenage daughter. But a true competitor knows not to waste the perfect shot at love.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;He’s a fighter in the rink, but he’s about to learn that playing nice can help you score...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As team captain and enforcer, Patrick O'Doul puts the bruise in the Brooklyn Bruisers. But after years of hard hits, O'Doul is feeling the burn, both physically and mentally. He conceals his pain from his coach and trainers, but when his chronic hip injury becomes too obvious to ignore, they send him for sessions with the team’s massage therapist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After breaking up with her long-term boyfriend, Ari Bettini is in need of peace of mind. For now, she’s decided to focus on her work: rehabilitating the Bruisers’ MVP. O'Doul is easy on the eyes, but his reaction to her touch is ice cold. Ari is determined to help O'Doul heal, but as the tension between them turns red hot, they both learn that a little TLC does the body good...</description>

  <description>From the dusty plains of Afghanistan to the sleek corridors of the New York Times, journalist MJ Buckman seeks the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. What she doesn’t expect to find is a man who’s her complete opposite … and fits her perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marine Sergeant Jackson Connor knows that relationships don’t work for men in the military. He’s living proof of that. But when a steely-eyed temptress in a flak jacket, who carries her moral cause in front of her, crosses his path, he’s furious, curious, and all kinds of in-lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A grown-up love story about two people who aren’t looking for love, but realize how precious it is when they find it. They don’t play games and there are no stupid misunderstandings, just life standing in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they compromise? And what does that look like in a modern relationship between two driven people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assignment Vs deployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re always traveling in different directions. What relationship can survive that?</description>

When her husband finally wins a long sought-after promotion, Caroline feels she has little choice but to follow him to a new home in San Diego. There she meets Sebastian, a young man of 17. &lt;br /&gt;For an all too brief summer, their happiness blooms. &lt;br /&gt;But external pressures begin to bear down, not least from the overbearing David, and Sebastian’s parents begin to suspect that their son has a secret. Even Caroline’s new friend, Donna, realises that dark passions exist below the serene surface.</description>

  <description>After eight years in prison, twenty-four year old Jordan Kane is the man everyone loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to return to his hometown while on parole, Jordan soon learns that this small town hasn't changed since he was carted off to juvie all those years ago. He is the local pariah, shunned by everyone, including his own parents. But their hatred of him doesn't even come close to the loathing he feels every time he looks in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working odd jobs for the preacher lady, Jordan bides his time before he can leave this backwards town. But can distance erase the memories that haunt him? Trapped in the prison of his own mind Jordan wonders if the pain of living will ever subside?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torrey Delaney is new in town and certainly doesn't behave in a way the locals believe a preacher’s daughter should. Her reputation for casual hook-ups and meaningless sex is the talk of the town. Add that to her budding friendship with the hardened ex-con handyman, and the good Reverend is less than thrilled with her estranged daughter’s path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As friendship forms, is it possible for two damaged people who are afraid to love take their relationship to the next level? Can Torrey live with Jordan’s demons, and can Jordan break through Torrey's walls? With the disapproval of a small town weighing heavily on them, will they find their place in the world? Can they struggle against the odds, or will their world be viciously shattered?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is love a life sentence?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to scenes of a sexual nature, not recommended for under 18.</description>

  <description>When U.S. Marine Corp Sgt. Orion MacKinnon loses both his legs in the bloody sands of Afghanistan, he forsakes his soul along with them. After retiring to a remote location in the snowy mountains of Alaska with his Special Forces canine companion—a German Shepherd named Zeus—he becomes a recluse and vows never to wear the prosthetic legs he keeps buried out of sight… &lt;br /&gt;until a lone hiker becomes trapped beneath an avalanche on his mountain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The woman Orion calls Hope can’t recall a shred of her former life. As he tends to her wounds she slowly begins to unravel the tight seclusion he has wrapped around himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She can’t remember her past. He only wants to forget his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the two have more in common with the forces that brought them together than they realize, including the sinister presence that will threaten their very lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When their pasts collide, will they survive the future? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>No last names. No life stories. Those were the rules. Now a USA Today bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time a cocky, copper-haired tourist sauntered into Zara’s bar. And even though she knew better, Zara indulged in a cure for the small-town blues. It was supposed to be an uncomplicated fling—a few sizzling weeks before he went back to his life, and she moved on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until an accidental pregnancy changed her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, she’s made peace with the notion that Dave From Brooklyn will never be found. Until one summer day when he walks into her coffee shop, leveling her with the same hot smile that always renders her defenseless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey star Dave Beringer has never forgotten the intense month he spent with prickly Zara. Their nights together were the first true intimacy he’d ever experienced. But the discovery of his child is the shock of a lifetime, and his ugly past puts relationships and family out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does it? Vermont’s countryside has a way of nurturing even tortured souls. The fields and the orchards—and hard won love—are Bountiful.</description>

  <description>Christmas is a time for giving - what do you do when no one gives a damn? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Zachary Weston Christmas means sleeping on a churchyard bench in the freezing snow with nothing better in his future. Thrown out of his home for being gay, he is left without money or, it seems, anywhere to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a stranger shows him that some people do give a lot more than a damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Hamilton is a rookie cop in his small home town. He finds a young throwaway, fresh from the city, sleeping on a bench in the churchyard on a snowy Christmas Eve. Can he be the one to give Zachary his own Christmas miracle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published December 2010</description>

  <description>For five years, Zach Tyler, son of one of the world's richest software moguls, was held hostage, tortured, and abused. When he is rescued at last from the Venezuelan jungle, he is physically and psychologically shattered, but he slowly begins to rebuild the life he should have had before an innocent kiss sent him into hell. His childhood best friend David has lived those years with overwhelming guilt and grief. Every relationship David has tried has fallen apart because of his feelings for a boy he thought dead. When Zach is rescued, David is overjoyed--and then crushed when Zach shuts him out. Two years later, David returns home, and he and Zach must come to terms with the rift between them, what they feel for each other, and what their future could hold. But Zach has secrets, and one of them might well destroy their fragile love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Normal is just a setting on the dryer.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High school graduate Jeremey Samson is looking forward to burying his head under the covers and sleeping until it’s time to leave for college. Then a tornado named Emmet Washington enters his life. The double major in math and computer science is handsome, forward, wicked smart, interested in dating Jeremey—and he’s autistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jeremey doesn’t judge him for that. He’s too busy judging himself, as are his parents, who don’t believe in things like clinical depression. When his untreated illness reaches a critical breaking point, Emmet is the white knight who rescues him and brings him along as a roommate to The Roosevelt, a quirky new assisted living facility nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jeremey finds his feet at The Roosevelt, Emmet slowly begins to believe he can be loved for the man he is behind the autism. But before he can trust enough to fall head over heels, he must trust his own conviction that friendship is a healing force, and love can overcome any obstacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Contains characters obsessed with trains and counting, positive representations of autism and mental illness, a very dark moment, and Elwood Blues.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

But one day she’ll know, that every day spent away from her was hell. &lt;br /&gt;Watching her move on. &lt;br /&gt;Watching her change. &lt;br /&gt;But it will all be worth it once she’s safe.&lt;br /&gt;Even if she doesn’t know it, she is my Rapture.</description>

It is not a standalone, and you should read all the books in order.<br /><br />The first two books of the series, Descent and Crash I absolutely loved.

  <description>As a kid, Logan Preston was a brat. &lt;br /&gt;Through his teens, he became the bad boy. &lt;br /&gt;Now, at nineteen, no one knows what the hell to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High school dropout, Logan Preston is a &lt;br /&gt;good-for-nothing stoner. &lt;br /&gt;A black sheep. &lt;br /&gt;A disappointment. &lt;br /&gt;The worst Preston Punk of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;At least that’s how everyone in his small town &lt;br /&gt;makes him feel. &lt;br /&gt;But Logan Preston has secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Secrets so dark and so deep below the surface that the only way he can fight them is to stay high, high, high. &lt;br /&gt;He wears cockiness as a mask. &lt;br /&gt;Arrogance as his armor. &lt;br /&gt;Until one girl, one night, asks one life-changing question: &lt;br /&gt;What's beneath the bravado, Logan Preston?</description>

  <description>“Behind those eyes, a battle rages. One that’s not fought overseas with guns and tanks, but one that wreaks havoc in the homeland with harshly spoken words and misguided beliefs.”&lt;br /&gt;One week is all we were supposed to share. One week as strangers. Yet you became so much more.&lt;br /&gt;You were the echo in my storm.&lt;br /&gt;All the little things you did differently irked me. I thought it meant we couldn’t get along, that there was no chance we’d work out. But when it came time for me to leave, you know what I figured out?&lt;br /&gt;They were the faint call of home, lost on the wind and the roar of thunder. It was you calling me, hoping I’d hear you and find my way out of the dark that I had lost myself in when I shut off to survive.&lt;br /&gt;You were my echo. My call back.&lt;br /&gt;And damn it all if I didn’t find home in the end.</description>

  <description>"My life is in the Wolf's hands."&lt;br /&gt;He is the Wolf. I am his Red. The game has begun and he wants me dead. &lt;br /&gt;But who is the Wolf? &lt;br /&gt;And why has he chosen me?&lt;br /&gt;He whistles a tune that's haunting. He glares at me through eyes that are vacant. I feel his heart beating, yet I know he has no soul. He moves like the wind...I can't hear his footsteps. I want this to end. He's playing with my mind. He branded me with ink. He wants to destroy me.&lt;br /&gt;"I, Reid, take thee, Morgan, to be my wife. To have and to hold, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part..."&lt;br /&gt;I have a reason to keep running. &lt;br /&gt;There's no time to blink. &lt;br /&gt;Don't look back. Don't make a sound. &lt;br /&gt;I know he's behind me</description>

  <description>He taught me to kill. Murder is in my blood now. It runs through my veins and though I hide the monster I see in the mirror with ink, it doesn’t keep him from coming out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My street name is Mercy, but I never show any. Except for her. I watch Becca, though she doesn’t know. She saved me a long time ago; the day my father killed my mother. Her bravery turned her into a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father holds a grudge and knife with the same proficiency, and Becca is the focus of his hatred. And I’m the only monster who can save her.</description>

  <description>“When the broken man with scarred skin walked into Heathens, asked for a job, and showed me a sketch of a phoenix, it felt like fate.”~ Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started with an anonymous post by someone who didn't want to live anymore. I read it over and over again, unable to get it out of my mind. What if my brother Johnny had posted something like this before he'd taken his own life? Would someone have been able to save him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been living a lie for 16 long years and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep it up. And when a beautiful, broken man walks into my tattoo shop asking for a second chance at life, I know I'll never be able to turn him away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“When I was so far down I couldn’t even see the light, a stranger reached in to save me”~ Nox&lt;br /&gt;I didn't have anything to live for, until a kind stranger pulled me back from the brink. With physical and emotional scars I have nowhere to turn now but to that same stranger who saved my life without realizing it. But as my feelings for Adam grow, will I ever be anything other than a surrogate for the brother he couldn’t save? Am I even worthy of his love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**From Ashes is the third book in the Heathens Ink series, each book in the series CAN be read as a standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: this book contains graphic descriptions of domestic violence and drug use that may be disturbing to some readers.</description>

  <description>On Valentine's Day, Country Music King Lee Maverick's life took a drastic turn when his wife, fellow country crooner Miranda Wallen, asked him for a divorce. It's exactly what both of them wanted but after ten years touring together, Maverick is unsure what his career will be like without Miranda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle Kelly, or KK as her friends call her, has been waiting for her big break into the country music scene. After another broken heart from a local guitar player, KK decides to give up on her musical aspirations, but her best friend, Brianna Rossi, refuses to let it go that easily. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to her best friend, KK joins the newly divorced Maverick in his singing endeavors. After spending the first part of the tour fighting their attraction for one another, they finally give in to the inevitable. Both think they've found their happiness... until Maverick's ex wants back in the picture, exactly where she left off.</description>

  <description>“Stop pretending there’s nothing between us and kiss me already.” ~Johnny&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what made me so bold, but I can’t find it in me to regret it. I know he’s my brother’s best friend and I know he’s a little too old for me, but he’s the only thing in my life that makes me happy. Between assholes at school and my dwindling self-esteem, when an online friend suggests I try some pills to take the edge off I’m willing to try anything to stop the pain. But every day I feel like I’m falling further down the rabbit hole and I’m not sure even Gage can pull me back up.&lt;br /&gt;“I'm getting ahead of myself, but there's no falling slowly with someone you've known your entire life.” ~ Gage&lt;br /&gt;My feelings for Johnny were unexpected, but once I see them for what they are I can’t deny them. I know Adam might hate me for falling for his younger brother and I know Johnny’s been going through some things lately, but love can conquer anything, right?&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: if you’re already a reader of the Heathens Ink Series this goes without saying, but this story is full-on ugly cry and a HEA isn’t in the cards. For trigger warnings please see the first page.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a really quick read that just gives a basic intro to the Heathens Ink crew. Not much of a story to really hook you in, but enough to introduce you to characters and want to know more. ]]>

  <description>“I never thought I could want anyone as much as I wanted Nash, then I met you”~Royal &lt;br /&gt;When I was sixteen I was afflicted with a terrible curse...I fell in love with my straight best friend. I never thought I’d move past my feelings for Nash and find someone who could love me in return, until the day a gorgeous marine plopped himself down in my chair and asked me to ink him. I’m falling fast for Zade, but my feelings for Nash are still very real. When life starts getting complicated and Nash speaks the words I never thought I’d hear, the only thing I want is for us to find a way to make this work...together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“What if I told you, you'd never have to choose?”~Zade &lt;br /&gt;I thought I’d stay in the marines for life, that was the plan. But after a traumatic event I couldn’t make myself re-enlist when my contract was up. Confused and unsure what to do next I called up my best friend for a place to stay. What I didn’t count on was my best friend’s boyfriend practically throwing a sexy tattoo artist at me to keep me busy. Royal is everything I’ve ever wanted and his roommate, Nash, is starting to grow on me, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A few weeks ago I thought I was straight. Now I'm sandwiched between two sweaty men. Can't say I do anything half-assed.” ~Nash &lt;br /&gt;Of course I’ve noticed that my best friend, Royal is crazy good looking. I have eyes, that doesn’t mean I’m into guys. Although, when I start to notice that his new boyfriend, Zade, is pretty hot too, that makes me start to question things a little. Not to mention the dreams I keep having of the three of us together. I’m willing to try if they are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**This is NOT a love triangle, just good old fashioned man-on-man-on-man love &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every book in the Heathens Ink series can be read as a stand-alone, but it’s way more fun to read them in order. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Braylen didn't even want to go to Lennon Pryor's epic graduation-night party, but when Fynn begs her to be his "wingwoman," she can't deny him. Talking up her BFF—how he's magic behind a camera, with a killer sense of humor and eyelashes that frame the most gorgeous blue eyes in the history of forever—is easy. Supporting his efforts to woo someone so completely wrong for him? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fynn knows that grad night is his last shot before leaving for college to find true love. But over the course of the coolest party of their high school careers, he starts to see that perhaps what he really wants has been in front of him all along. Bray's been his best friend since kindergarten, though, and he'd rather have her in his life as a friend than not at all.</description>

  <description>Roselette Horton... &lt;br /&gt;Miss Prim and Proper. &lt;br /&gt;Arm candy for one of the richest men in Hoffman. &lt;br /&gt;Fate had her saving my life. Now I'm indebted to repay the favour.&lt;br /&gt;Rose has the biggest stick up her arse. It’s surprising she can even put one foot in front of the other. She has no clue what it means to be living, or who she really is. To the outside world Rose has everything, but to those who pay close attention, it’s nothing short of a well-constructed façade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Finlay Crossley and I’m a simple misfit from the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt;Until three days ago, I didn't have two cents to rub together. &lt;br /&gt;Rose is my opposite in every way, but as the saying goes—‘opposites attract.’ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How in the world does a socialite notice a nobody like me? &lt;br /&gt;It all happens when a loser becomes a winner.</description>

  <description>Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.&lt;br /&gt;Bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;Words destroyed me. &lt;br /&gt;“I’m sorry. She didn’t make it.”&lt;br /&gt;“Daddy, he can’t breathe!” &lt;br /&gt;“There’s nothing more we can do for your son.”&lt;br /&gt;Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.&lt;br /&gt;Lies.&lt;br /&gt;Those syllables and letters became my executioner. I told myself that, if I didn’t acknowledge the pain and the fear, they would have no power over me. But, as the years passed, the hate and the anger left behind began to control me.&lt;br /&gt;Two words—that was all it took to plunge my life into darkness.&lt;br /&gt;“He’s gone.” &lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was four soft, silky words that gave me hope of another sunrise. &lt;br /&gt;“Hi. I’m Charlotte Mills.”</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a wonderful conclusion to The Darkest Sunrise Duet! <br /><br />The story picked up right where the first one left off. The characters were amazing. I loved Porter and Charlotte, and Travis was such an amazing side character! I love seeing child characters really come to life in stories.<br /><br />...]]>

  <description>I’m not crazy. My mother may have died with everyone believing she was insane, but I refuse to accept that as my fate. Even if I am recalling memories about a life I never lived. A life that includes the mysterious James—a guy I’ve only just met, but feel as if I’ve known all my life. The memories are coming hard and fast, and I’m falling down a rabbit hole with consequences that far exceed anything I could have ever imagined. And now, someone is trying to kill me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone from my past who knows about my visions and is looking for something he believes I took from him. All I have to do is figure out how these memories relate to the present and maybe I’ll survive to live another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe…</description>

  <description>I don’t have a damn thing in common with the beautiful rich girl who walks into my bar; she’s southern class, fancy cars, and designer shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve got a drunk for a mother, a cheater for a father, and a reputation for trouble I’ve more than earned.&lt;br /&gt;I look the other way, pretending I don’t notice how perfect she is. She wouldn’t give me the time of day anyway. Until she shatters that first impression and shows me she’s so much more—everything I never thought I deserved.&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of being a disappointment, I want to prove to her that I’m better than my past.&lt;br /&gt;We have one tragic thing in common, and the thread that binds us together will tear us apart as it unravels.&lt;br /&gt;Are we strong enough to break through The Bars Between Us?</description>

      <![CDATA[The Bars Between Us was a really great story. I felt a connection with the characters and the storyline was unique. I thought I had the plot figured out from the start, but it totally went another direction, which was great, because it kept me guessing what the connection was throughout the book....]]>

  <description>I’m that guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camilla Landry rustles against me, the silky fabric of her overpriced lingerie slipping along my bruised rib. The porcelain perfection of her skin is even more innocent against the colorful ink dotting my own. It’s demure meets damaged, pampered meets punctured. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, it’s obvious I’m that guy. Dominic Hughes. Her attempt at rebellion. Her bid to see what the other side of the tracks feel like. I’m okay with being used because, from where I’m sitting, the other side of the tracks have never looked so good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The deadliest weapons are the ones we never see.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keyboard prodigy, Lexi Donovan has risen from teenage orphan of the streets to complete independence with little help along the way. When a friend is threatened, Lexi’s anonymous message sends police into a firefight, leading to a wounded cop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Ethan McAllister’s well-ordered life turned upside down the day an obscure text message led to a sexual predator’s identity. Since then, Callouston PD’s finest can’t trace the elusive hacker. The latest tip leads him to a brutal mutilation and a riddle indicating the identity of the next murder victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark net houses a playground for the morally depleted and criminally insane. When Lexi discovers the killer’s digital betting arena, she finds herself centered in a cyber stalker’s crosshairs bearing equal talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Street life strengthened Lexi while toughening her protective shell, but nothing could shield her from the shrewd detective forging a path to her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Theft of spirit is no one’s birthright.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quirk of her X chromosome furnished Alexis with an edge few others enjoyed. After fate plunged Lexi into orphan status and an intolerable foster home forced her to the streets, a group of prostitutes sheltered her from their vicious pimp. Seeing something special within, they nurtured and shielded her from their harsh reality until she could forge her own path in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destiny frequently takes us back to our roots. Lexi’s return journey begins when a serial killer attacks someone who’d offered her refuge in her previous life. Relying on courage and wit, she must stay a step ahead and secure evidence to free her family from a psychopathic murderer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN B073TCL49T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Brighton Starling needed on one of the most humiliating days of her life was to run into her ex… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naturally, she did. And two years after he walked away, leaving her hurt and broke, he somehow managed to look better than ever. Of course. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She didn’t want to see him, let alone speak to him, but apparently, he wasn’t going to give her a choice. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;br /&gt;All Sebastian Figures wanted was to talk to the one that got away… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, scratch that. The one he drove away with poor decisions and lies, big and small. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She might have been having a bad day, but she was still the bright, beautiful girl he’d been missing for far too long. His brightest star. Still the only girl he’d ever want. If only he could convince her of that. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;br /&gt;Is it too late to say sorry? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sebastian wants a chance to win back Brighton’s trust—and her future. &lt;br /&gt;Brighton wants to be able to move on from the past, once and for all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But neither of them want to say one final goodbye…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She wanted to start again. To be someone---&lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;---different . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freedom. When Carleigh Stanger thought of college, that was the word that came to mind. Freedom from her unhappy home life. Freedom from high school mistakes. Freedom from the memory of that terrible morning. Only instead of bringing a sweet escape, Carleigh's first campus party traps her in the scornful gaze of the last person she wants to see, Tucker Green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long ago that being close to Carleigh was everything Tucker wanted. But that was before he realized she was just another scheming girl who'd do whatever it took to get her way. Even lie to the guy she claimed to love. Unfortunately while Tucker's brain remembers the pain Carleigh caused, his body only remembers the pleasure . . .</description>

  <description>Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever coined that phrase is a bald-faced liar. Words are often the sharpest weapon of all, triggering some of the most powerful emotions a human can experience.&lt;br /&gt;“You’re pregnant.”&lt;br /&gt;“It’s a boy.” &lt;br /&gt;“Your son needs a heart transplant.”&lt;br /&gt;Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.&lt;br /&gt;Lies.&lt;br /&gt;Syllables and letters may not be tangible, but they can still destroy your entire life faster than a bullet from a gun.&lt;br /&gt;Two words—that was all it took to extinguish the sun from my sky.&lt;br /&gt;“He’s gone.” &lt;br /&gt;For ten years, the darkness consumed me.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was four deep, gravelly words that gave me hope of another sunrise. &lt;br /&gt;“Hi. I’m Porter Reese.”</description>

  <description>Experience Declan’s complete story. Includes RONE-nominated novella “Decide” and an exclusive bonus novella “Decode”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As high school sweethearts, Declan Reede and Alyssa Dawson didn’t always see eye-to-eye. Especially when it came to his dream of being a driver in the ProV8 series. When he’s offered the chance at the career of his dreams, Declan straps himself in for the ride regardless of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Older, but not wiser, Declan is on the path to becoming a racing legend. Only, regret haunts him around the track and threatens to send him off-course. When a chance encounter offers the opportunity to correct his mistakes, Declan must learn to manage the curves if he wants to claim the ultimate prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to strong language and sexual content not intended for anyone under the age of 18**</description>

Only, as he races toward the finish line, old adversaries become new threats. Declan must overcome the past and face the challenges head on if he's to claim the life he now believes he deserves. What will it take for him to declare his true desires? Will it be enough to claim the ultimate victory?</description>

  <description>Straighten up, pull it around, and get back on the track. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan Reede's life is in a tail-spin. Although he knows what he wants, he can't see the road that will take him there. Wherever he turns, new secrets, lies, and half-truths threaten to send him crashing off-course. To deserve his family, he must fight his past mistakes and prove himself worthy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can someone out to deceive cost him the life he now craves? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to strong language and sexual content not intended for anyone under age of 18**</description>

  <description>There's nothing, not anymore. &lt;br /&gt;No perfect life. &lt;br /&gt;No clear path. &lt;br /&gt;Just...nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn't want the life my parents mapped out for me. Being the piano prodigy was never my goal. It was theirs.&lt;br /&gt;I craved normalcy, a life of my own.&lt;br /&gt;I should have been careful what I wished for because one second, one moment of anger was all it took to rip away everything that mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm left with nothing but regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks he can save me, but the shadows that surround always pull me back, reminding me of what I'd done, of what I'd wanted.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's a rock god. I'm a nothing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I refuse to take him down with me.</description>

  <description>Living in the shadow of a legend has its drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every aspect of Phoebe Reede’s life has been defined by her father. Caught halfway between being a teen and an adult, she yearns to break free from the weight of expectations surrounding the Reede name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her desire for freedom sends her overseas on her first solo journey. There, she finds herself having an unexpected adventure with an unlikely person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can she learn who she wants to be and what is nothing more than a phase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to strong language and sexual content not intended for anyone under the age of 18. Some books in this series contain content, including sexual assault and violence, that may trigger emotional distress in some readers.**</description>

  <description>Strap in, get ready to start your engines and see where it all began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an early age, Declan Reede’s only goal was to race in the ProV8 Championship Series. One thing he couldn’t anticipate was that a blistering kiss shared with his best friend, Alyssa Dawson, might derail his plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While he knows things between them will never be the same, it’s impossible to predict just where the road will take them, or how rocky it might get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he decide to fight for love or follow his dreams?</description>

  <description>It’s the same old story, really. &lt;br /&gt;Good versus evil. &lt;br /&gt;Heroes versus villains. &lt;br /&gt;Light versus dark. &lt;br /&gt;For two years, college freshman Noah Morgan lived his life somewhere in the middle, fighting darkness and light, always searching for answers to a single question:&lt;br /&gt;Why, Noah, why?&lt;br /&gt;The same three words keep him up at night, struggling for air while gripping a plastic cylinder containing white pills to match the white label with his name printed in ink as deep and dark as his memories—memories that turned him into a recluse. &lt;br /&gt;A shut-in. &lt;br /&gt;An introvert.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for him, that’s not how the girl next door sees him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three life-altering months…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how long it’s been since Amelia Greyson joined the Just an Illusion Tour with Bastards and Dangerous. She’s made new friends, embraced her past, and even found love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back on the road …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a tragic situation, Amelia is determined to hit the road, put her life in order, and finish the book she was hired to write. Mel’s not the only one affected by what happened; the men of BAD are all trying to move forward, not wanting the past to ruin the remainder of their farewell tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brother vs Brother… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tensions are high on the Weston brothers’ bus. As each brother settles into their role in Amelia’s life, secrets threaten to rip their relationship to shreds. Can Noah and Sawyer find a way to save the brotherly bond they share? Or will the woman of their dreams end up tearing them apart for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just an Illusion - The B Side&lt;/i&gt;, is the second book in &lt;i&gt;The Illusion Series&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Just an Illusion - Side A&lt;/i&gt;, should be read first to follow the storyline.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One night changed her life…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Amelia Greyson has grown up in the music industry and isn’t the slightest bit fazed by fame or celebrities. However, when she attends a Bastards and Dangerous concert with her best friend Belle, her world shifts on its axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double trouble…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sawyer and Noah Weston are the front men of BAD. They’re fraternal twins and sexy as sin. When they hear the author of The O Factor is in their green room, they’re intrigued. She’s just the person they need to write their farewell story. The brothers offer Amelia the opportunity of a lifetime, which she reluctantly accepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three hearts…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah is sweet and considerate, working hard to make Amelia feel at home on the road. Unfortunately, the closer they get, the more obnoxious Sawyer becomes. Sawyer is arrogant and distant and he wants Amelia, even though she’s not his for the taking. Only during stolen moments does Sawyer show her who he really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Amelia maintain a safe distance from Sawyer and keep her heart intact? Or will she shatter Noah’s heart by giving hers to his brother instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just an Illusion – Side A&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in &lt;i&gt;The Illusion Series&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Reading order of &lt;i&gt;The Illusion Series: &lt;br /&gt;Just an Illusion - Side A &lt;br /&gt;Just an Illusion - The B Side&lt;br /&gt;Just an Illusion - EP&lt;br /&gt;Just an Illusion - Unplugged&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Feeling the rush comes with a price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mackenzie Cox has lost everything—except Hayden Hayes. With Kenzie's racing career over, and her family no longer speaking to her, Hayden has been her rock, as she tries to pick up the pieces of what was once her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Hayden's racing team hires his beautiful ex-girlfriend, Felicia, to be their new hotshot rider, Kenzie and Hayden's seemingly solid relationship begins to crack. Kenzie can only watch from the sidelines, as Felicia lives the life she was forced to leave behind, and as tension begins to build between Hayden and Kenzie, she wonders if Hayden isn’t the man she once knew.</description>

  <description>Paranormal real estate agent, Sloane Osborne sells haunted houses. And she's getting quite good at it. But not all hauntings are the same. Some are common manifestations but others are more sinister—dark and evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called in to investigate a beach front home in charming Yarmouth, Maine, Sloane envies one couple's happy future whereas hers has been ripped away. These days, she finds more comfort in hunting the dead than being among the living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this fairy tale New England home has a dark secret: the new owner has gone missing—inside the house. Is Sloane in over her head? When the local ghost hunting team gets involved, they make things worse, waking up a latent evil that refuses to be banished. Some ghosts do more than haunt houses—they fight back to inflict their own torment on the living.</description>

  <description>Leading man on the new E.D.G.E. series reality show? Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stunt-double for the star in the latest, multi-million-dollar funded military movie? Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work with a sexy female military expert? Holy hell, check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I signed on to do stunts for Hollywood’s eagerly awaited war-thriller, I thought it would be like every other gig—go in, try not to get killed, and leave with a fat check and an adrenaline rush. This time? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mackenzie Patterson is the on-set expert. She knows topographical layouts, government lingo, speaks four languages, and is one of the best explosive disposal leaders the Air Force has ever seen, so she’s more than qualified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s also the woman who turned my teenage heart to ash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t ignore the darkness that has appeared in her eyes, or the urge I have to take it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quitting isn’t an option, but the more I see her, the more I want to make her mine. And that can never happen because our past is twisted with heartbreak, hate, and regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every second I spend with her is a battle between holding on to the anger in my heart—and giving in to the love that never left.</description>

  <description>Looking in the past, you can find your future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally ready to start over on her own terms, Bettina Brandt is letting go of the horrors of her past marriage and moving on. Used to the confines of her ex-husband's rules and regulations, she's excited to go on a ghost hunt of an old Victorian boarding house with her friends. But when strange events begin to emerge, Bettina is convinced something followed her home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth Hynek accepts the solitude of his afterlife. Brooding and reliving the hellish memories of World War II are more tolerable when he's alone. But something changes when he sets out to scare off the group of women who've invaded his home. One of the women sparks something in him---something he can't identify. Keen to know more about Bettina, he follows her home, realizing he can communicate with her through her dreams. But when Bettina's ex-husband finds her and threatens her, Seth fears he can't protect her. Once again, Seth is haunted by the idea that he can't save the one woman who needs him the most. With their pasts colliding with the present, will their ghostly romance end before they can find a way to create a future together?</description>

  <description>His name is Luke. But nobody knows that. He was an iconic musician before he gave up music. But nobody knows that either. They also don’t know he’s twenty-seven, that he used to have an infectious laugh, and that he’s way too young to be widowed. They certainly don’t know the rest of his tragic story. All they know is that he comes into their café at the same time every morning and stares at the same chair at the same table. They know he’s strange. They know he interrupts their breakfast with a cold blast of air as he hovers in the doorway, mustering the courage to confront a piece of furniture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one asks why. No one cares. He’s fine with that. He’s done with life. This isn’t even his story anymore. It’s actually Callie’s, the young writer who sat in his chair one day.</description>

The characters and story that Alyson Santos creates is nothing short of amazing. <br /><br />Luke Craven was just such a haunted character, so much pain and guilt that he lives with.

  <description>“Trust me, I’ve wanted to punch you in the face a time or five.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the man you worshipped as a kid becomes your coach, it’s supposed to be the greatest thing in the world. Keywords: supposed to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn't take a week for 27-year-old Sal Casillas to wonder what she'd seen in the international soccer icon - why she'd ever had his posters on her wall or ever envisioned marrying him and having super-playing soccer babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sal had long ago gotten over the worst non-break-up in the history of imaginary relationships with a man who hadn't known she'd existed. So she isn't prepared for this version of Reiner Kulti who shows up to her team's season: a quiet, reclusive shadow of the explosive, passionate man he'd once been.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can you fall in love with someone you've never even met?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailey Taylor Emery has a hunch that her favorite client at Fetch—an anonymous virtual assistant service—is actually hockey star Matt Eriksson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it's against the rules for her to check his file, she's 95% sure she spends at least part of each day texting with her lifelong crush and catering to his every need. Still nursing a wounded heart thanks to her recent breakup, Hailey is perfectly content with some harmless online flirting... until she has to meet her client. Face to face. Cue: utter panic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matt Eriksson is no stranger to heartbreak. He's still not over the destruction of his marriage, and it sucks to be the only guy on the team who knows the truth—that hockey and long-term relationships are a toxic mix. He barely sees his kids, and dealing with his ex makes him feel insane. The only person in his life who seems to understand is someone who won't show her pretty face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it's nothing that a pair of fourth row hockey seats can't fix. Hailey can't resist the offer. Matt can't resist Hailey. Good thing he doesn't have to. Fire up the kiss cam!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains rabid hockey fans, misunderstood dick pics, hockey players at the opera and exploding ovaries.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3 weeks. 5 cities. 15 impossible stunts. One reality show.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Cross came into Reya Cabrera’s world with a bang and faded out with a whimper. They vowed to make it work, but life had other plans. After chasing his TV dreams for years, Trev finally became the UK’s next big reality star, but he alienated his family and friends in the process. Now he finally has everything he ever wanted. Women. Money. Fame. But none of it means anything when he doesn’t have the one thing that matters most: love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money leaves a gaping hole. Fame surrounds him with loneliness. And no woman makes him feel like Reya used to before the whirlwind of success pulled them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has a plan to get her back. However, with a hectic filming schedule looming, the only way to do that is to convince her to come on the road with him. Reya has been stuck in a rut for a while, and the opportunity to travel across Europe and play her music for new audiences seems like heaven. The only catch? She has to do it with the one boy who ever got close enough to break her heart. But he’s not a boy anymore, and as she gets to know him again she can’t deny her respect for the man he’s become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time she’s around him her heart feels full of air, like a balloon about to pop. Little does she know, Trev’s feelings are just as tumultuous as hers. One thing’s for sure, these three weeks on the road together will either make them whole again or break them irrevocably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Hearts on Air&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary romance and book #6 in the &lt;i&gt;Hearts&lt;/i&gt; series, however it can also be read as a complete standalone.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Fame, fortune and a future paved with rock 'n roll gold - Blaise Nolan has it all. With his brooding good looks, haunting voice and troubled lyrics of a soul gone lost, it's no wonder his band Finding Nolan has been climbing the music charts with back to back hits. Only Blaise didn't wind up brooding, haunted and lost by accident... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avalon Jennison has been the girl next door since she was five. The best friend since she was eight. The band manager since she was sixteen, and the keeper of his secrets always. Ava's been there every step of the way, helping Blaise live his dreams and keep his nightmares at bay. But the years of putting Blaise's needs above her own are about to be over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Blaise has one secret even Ava doesn't know..and it could be the thing that breaks her heart completely, or finally puts it back together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**CONTENT WARNING ~ ADULT LANGUAGE**</description>

  <description>“My one fear is now my reality.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t offer his name when he fulfilled his need to include me as a player in his game.&lt;br /&gt;I’m number thirteen. Just a number given to the bitches who wronged him.&lt;br /&gt;I was blindsided. Stolen from my life. In his devilled eyes, I have a debt to pay…he wants my final breath to see us even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know who you are Morgan Banks, the question is, who am I? Five games will set you free when you can tell me who I’d be.”- The Wolf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I strong enough to take on the Wolf?</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed the second book of this series. It follows the story of Evelyn Westby, the youngest Westby sister. She has the curse of silence, and can only speak in front of her immediate family, otherwise she can't speak. When her fiancé breaks things off with her she decides to take matters...]]>

  <description>Every race has a finish line.&lt;br /&gt;Where you go after you cross it is what matters most.&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes, that’s the most intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;Here at GearShark, we’ve featured lots of drivers.&lt;br /&gt;All of them are well acquainted with the finish line.&lt;br /&gt;And as race fans, we’re well acquainted with cheering as they cross it.&lt;br /&gt;What we aren’t privy to is riding shotgun, seeing where they drive once the race is over.&lt;br /&gt;Our interviews barely scratch the surface,&lt;br /&gt;offering just a glimpse of the men and women behind the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of vanished Motocross sensation Jayson Hamilton,&lt;br /&gt;who has been right under our noses for years, proves secrets abound.&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to dig deep. Look beyond the racetrack at the drivers who continue to pique our interest. In addition to scoring an exclusive, all-access interview with the elusive Jayson Hamilton (his first and only since the death of his fellow racer and partner Matt Lewis),&lt;br /&gt;we’ve caught up with some of our most popular featured men and women in the racing world.&lt;br /&gt;Where are they now?&lt;br /&gt;Who are they now?&lt;br /&gt;What do these hot commodities do when they escape the spotlight?&lt;br /&gt;Rumors of weddings, babies, and new tattoos swirl through the media on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;And though we’re headlining the hashtag #Finishline, we’re far from finished.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, we’re just getting started.</description>

  <description>Nothing but a #blur… &lt;br /&gt;There’s a new kid in town, and he’s hell on wheels. &lt;br /&gt;From what we’ve heard, it may be because &lt;br /&gt;he knows exactly what hell’s like. &lt;br /&gt;Lonely. &lt;br /&gt;Scorching. &lt;br /&gt;Unforgiving. &lt;br /&gt;You may know his brother, the NRR hotshot &lt;br /&gt;(and former GearShark cover model) &lt;br /&gt;Lorhaven. &lt;br /&gt;It’s only natural a driver with his background and family connections &lt;br /&gt;has sped his racecar into the newest, hottest division. &lt;br /&gt;But that’s not all. &lt;br /&gt;Arrow may be following in big bro’s tread marks, &lt;br /&gt;but he doesn’t plan to stay there. &lt;br /&gt;He’s swerving onto the road less traveled… &lt;br /&gt;and a lot more controversial. &lt;br /&gt;He’s opening up about his private struggles with sexuality &lt;br /&gt;to tell a story that’s gone unheard until now. &lt;br /&gt;One thing’s for sure; Arrow may have a painful past, &lt;br /&gt;but his foot is heavy on the accelerator. &lt;br /&gt;With speed like this, he’s bound to leave everything behind in &lt;br /&gt;nothing but a #blur. &lt;br /&gt;Check out the full feature article inside… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place where dreams fade and hope dies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what it’s meant for the five years that Garrett has been behind bars. But now hope is on the horizon and he’s daring to dream again: small dreams, small hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting his GED would be a start. If only his prison-appointed teacher Miss Ella Newsome wasn’t so damn sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Garrett and Ella start to play a dangerous game, the price could be higher than either of them have guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨.•*¨✨&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story first appeared in the anthology HOT FOR TEACHER in 2016. It has since been extended with new scenes, more heart ache and even more heat.</description>

  <description>Out of print&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you remember that moment? &lt;br /&gt;That one moment. &lt;br /&gt;The one when you changed.&lt;br /&gt;People might say it was this or that, but deep down you know.&lt;br /&gt;You know exactly what that moment was. Even if you're not ready to admit it to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;You know.&lt;br /&gt;I remember mine, it didn't just change me.&lt;br /&gt;It changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thought Mason Knight would be the whirlwind that swept me away, my unexpected hero in a leather jacket. But no one could’ve seen it coming. That moment woke me up and made me see that when we fall, sometimes we need help to get back up.</description>

  <description>Ellie Pagan has a list of reasons to stay away from Ford Landry.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s a mile long and was so much easier to stick to when he was a world away. Now that he’s standing in front of her—body hard and chiseled from a stint in the military, suit cut to perfection, and a smirk she could never resist—remembering all the reasons why just got a whole lot harder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ford gets Ellie isn’t his biggest fan. He just doesn’t care.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Standing in front of him, giving him hell, she’s even prettier than he remembered. All he can think about is how she felt in his arms, the taste of her kiss, the sound of her giggle in the middle of the night. He may not know how to win her back, but he does know this: he may have let her go once, but that’s one mistake he won’t make again.</description>

  <description>Jaxson&lt;br /&gt;I had it all. A loving wife, an amazing daughter, and a thriving career that would make anyone envious. Yet, in a blink of an eye, it all changed. My family, hopes, and dreams were gone, leaving me alone to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.&lt;br /&gt;Every day was a struggle to breathe, a constant reminder of what I had lost. I became bitter and angry, alienating my family and friends. I convinced myself that I would never find happiness again.&lt;br /&gt; Until my eyes were opened to Destiny. &lt;br /&gt;She became the light in my life and brightened my darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destiny&lt;br /&gt;Being a single mom was tough on its own; working three twelve-hour shifts a week while trying to maintain my farm on top of that meant there was no room in my life for a man. I thought I had it all under control. &lt;br /&gt;Until my job brought Jaxson into my life. &lt;br /&gt;He was a lost, suffering soul, but something drew my heart to his. My farm offered him a sanctuary to recover and rebuild his life. He wasn’t ready for what I had to offer, and I wasn’t sure I was prepared to completely let him in, but fate had a greater plan for us.&lt;br /&gt;He’s my future, and I am his. Together, we will discover what his future holds.</description>

Join Kate and Ian for the thrilling conclusion in White-Hot Hack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cybercriminals doxed undercover hacker Ian Bradshaw and forced him to flee, he begged Kate Watts for forgiveness and vowed never to hurt her again. He also convinced her to marry him, and when their idyllic summer on Roanoke Island comes to an end, the newlyweds relocate to their new home deep in the heart of Virginia’s horse and wine country. Ian still struggles with boundaries, but he keeps Kate’s lingerie drawer filled with surprises, and there’s no shortage of number-six kisses. There’s even a fast, new car to replace his beloved Shelby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian promised Kate that life with him would never be boring, but spending her days picking out paint colors and going to Pilates isn’t going to cut it. Meanwhile, Ian discovers that building a white-hat security firm from the ground up seems harder the second time around, and he might have underestimated how much he’d miss the undercover work he walked away from. To make matters worse, the hacktivists are threatening national security, and the task force could really use Ian’s help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate and Ian have always worried that their past would catch up to them, and when faced with the biggest showdown of their lives, they must capitalize on the one thing they excel at most: teamwork. Ian claims no one is a better hacker than him, but in order to triumph, he’ll have to prove it. And if he can’t, he risks losing the woman whose heart he worked so hard to hack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second and final book in the Kate and Ian series. The first book, Heart-Shaped Hack, can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>When Pea opened a portal and the alien cat, Max Gigan, jumped through from another dimension, he certainly didn't expect the talking tomcat to stay on as a family pet. He soon learns it can come in handy to have a fur ball from an alternate universe around when his friend re-opens the portal letting in vampire velociraptors who want to slime and eat the whole city! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pea’s dad is one of the first infected. But his dear old dad isn’t the only one. The dinosaurs escape the museum where the portal opened, and rampage through Milwaukee. As Pea's dad gets sicker, the BMX gang joins together with the feline army to corner the raptors and use them to develop an antidote. But Pea's meddling step-monster brothers threaten to ruin everything! A city wide alert goes out for the misidentified "turkeys" while Pea and his gang try to stay ahead of the hunt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the kids capture the dinos and get them home before they control everyone with their vampire powers? Will Pea’s dad remain infected forever? Join Pea and his gang in their battle against the SLIME SPEWING VAMPIRE VELOCIRAPTORS.</description>

  <description>ANGEL &lt;br /&gt;I know what you're whispering in the car as you pass me by. &lt;br /&gt;Hitchhiker. &lt;br /&gt;When you see me walking along the side of the road with my thumb out, you'll probably keep driving without giving me a second glance. You probably think I'm foolish. Naïve. &lt;br /&gt;You might assume I've made some bad decisions. &lt;br /&gt;You might think I'm too young to be on my own. &lt;br /&gt;You might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRAVIS &lt;br /&gt;I love my job, but driving an eighteen-wheeler comes with a certain stereotype. When you hear I’m a trucker, a specific image might come to mind. Uneducated. Dirty. Perverted. Rough around the edges and a little bit dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;But the truth is, I’m not any of those things. In fact, I’m pretty far from it. &lt;br /&gt;You’d be surprised to find out I’m one of the good guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although TRUCKER is the first book in the Good Guys series, it can be enjoyed as a standalone. Due to language and sexual content, this book is intended for readers 18 and older.</description>

  <description>Five sizzling hot stories of shifters finding their mates &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MOUSE AND THE BOUNTY HUNTER by C. L. Scholey &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A mouse by any other name would still be a mouse. Except Carlin is no mouse—it's just her nickname. Kidnapped by a Kodiak bear shifter and his gang, they demand Carlin shift into the mouse they think she is to help them rob a bank. When she's unable to shift, her captor assumes she's merely frightened and she’ll eventually shift…or die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tarvor has been on the gang's tail for years. The bounty hunter wasn't in any rush to capture the thieving nuisances, but now they have his mate. No more will Tarvor let the shifter gang run loose. Tarvor wants Carlin, and he wants her now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LORD OF THE HUNT by Juliet Cardin &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For generations the men of the Cole family have turned into wolves. Balen Cole has relentlessly searched for an end to the transformation. He becomes especially desperate when his betrothed arrives earlier than expected, seeking his protection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alena Harford had to rush to Balen's side when another man sought to claim her as his own. Though she’s heard the rumors about the Cole family, Alena is willing to risk anything to be Balen's bride. She plays the role of a delicate lady, but she isn't as helpless as she leads others to believe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pair finds love in each other's arms. But can they survive when a vile menace arrives threatening to expose their secrets and endangers their very lives? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MOONLIGHT by Ashlynn Monroe &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joslyn Jamison is a human woman that was raised by werewolves. After graduating college, she returns home, trying to decide if she should marry her long-time boyfriend. The man she really desires is Kane Wolfe, the secret crush of her teen years, but he's very off-limits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kane Wolfe is used to getting what he wants. He patiently waited for Jossy to grow up and see that she belongs to him, but he waited too long. Convincing the human that she's a fit mate for a werewolf is harder than he thought it would be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Joslyn is thrown into the middle of a pack war Kane is prepared to do whatever it takes to protect her. She's brave enough to live in his world, but is she courageous enough to accept him as her mate? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE HUNTER by Olivia Starke &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In order to impress Mike Conner, her crush from the gym, Trinity Gaines decides to head to a local conservation area to snap some wildlife pics. When she's attacked by a large animal, she's left wounded and helpless against whatever is stalking her through the trees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hunter Mike Conner let a werewolf slip from his grasp. Then he finds Trinity stranded in the forest after being attacked by the monster, and he's riddled with guilt. She's been served a death sentence—one he'll have to carry out himself in a few short weeks before she shifts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between them is undeniable, but Trinity and Mike find themselves in a fight for their lives. Will they survive or will the werewolf within Trinity destroy them both? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WILLIAM’S WARRIOR by T. Cobbin &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Porsha was born prematurely—a rare thing for a dragon shifter—and even as an adult, she's still small. Because of her size her parents were very protective. Now, her mother and father have decided it's time for her to mate, and they're determined to find the perfect person. They plan a party to introduce her to those males they deem worthy. The night of the party, Porsha runs away, and shortly afterward she joins the staff at Dragon's Heart as a waitress.</description>

      <![CDATA[All five of these shifter romances were great. The only author out of the five that I have read other books from is Ashlynn Monroe. All the rest are new to me authors. The stories were all quick and easy reads. My favorite two stories out of these five were definitely Moonlight by Ashlynn Monroe,...]]>

  <description>What do Dash Lexington, Easton Wells, and Connell Murphey have in common? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They put their lives on the line each day they clock into work. That and their fierce love for the women who match them step for step. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the studio head who produces both Dash and Easton’s shows announces auditions for a special series to highlight the E.D.G.E men’s skills, Connell and an extreme stunt man named Wade Roberts are the first stars chosen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their objective? Accompany Easton deep in the Amazon where he’s recently discovered the lost city of Paititi. With half the structure submerged in dangerous waters, a slew of unpredictable rainforest storms, and a nearly inaccessible location, each man will have to put aside his alpha tendencies and utilize his skills in order to survive the perils of the City of Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when an enemy from Easton’s past threatens the love of his life, she is met with the wrath of the newly formed E.D.G.E. clan, who will stop at nothing to protect the women they love.</description>

  <description>Sadie Jenkins’ most recent site of preservation is a sunken WWII cargo ship off the coast of the Bahamas. When a giant corporation threatens to blow it up to make way for an underwater gas pipeline, Sadie is forced to prove to the Head of Government the importance and value of her site. And when assistance comes from a bad-boy welder who works for the corporation, she ends up battling not only the people trying to demolish her site, but her heart as well—because its latched on to the one man who can save her ship or destroy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connell Murphey is the best underwater welder this side of the Atlantic and thrives when the stakes are highest. When Slade Industries offers him a dangerous gig with a big pay off, he can’t wait to sign on. When a local marine preservationist gives Slade trouble—her site’s protection would cost him millions to go around it instead of through it—Slade offers Connell the deal of a lifetime: twelve million has his name on it if he gets close to Sadie and testifies to the Head of Government that her site isn’t worth saving. Should be easy money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he meets Sadie. She’s a force to be reckoned with and the only woman who has ever been able to not only keep pace with him on a dive but completely surpass him on every level. She’s smart, sexy, and their chemistry is off the charts. The more he gets to know her, the harder he falls but he’s already in too deep with the deal he made with Slade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the time comes, will he be able to turn down the money and choose the girl of his dreams, or will too many lies kill his only chance at forever?</description>

  <description>Easton Wells has spent years burying his guilt by digging up some of the world’s most renowned treasures while surviving the dangerous terrains in which they’re located—all captured for television. When his producers threaten to axe the show, he has no choice but to turn to the last person he still trusts—the girl he left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain Walker has made a name for herself documenting wild and endangered animals, and the last voice she expects to hear while shooting in South Africa is Easton’s. He’s more gorgeous than she remembers, but the pain in her heart is as fresh as ever. They’d once planned on spending the rest of their lives together, but after her father’s tragic death while on expedition in Israel with him, Easton bailed on their future together without an explanation. It’s been nine years, and yet the intense love they shared seems only a moment ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he asks her to film his latest treasure hunt, Rain wants to turn him down instantly. But when he explains it’s to the same cave that swallowed her father, she can’t say no. She wants to experience the last place her father was alive, and she’s beyond curious about what happened to the boy she used to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ve got two weeks to locate a treasure that’s been lost for centuries, or Easton will lose the one thing in his life he’s come to depend on. As their old passion is reignited—and dark secrets uncovered—they face the extreme terrain of the mountain range that threatens them at every turn. As more than the wildlife and sharp drop-offs tries to kill them, Rain starts to question if the legendary treasure they seek—the same one her father had died trying to unearth—is truly meant to be found, or if some things, including their feelings for each other, are better left buried.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Charmed, Texas... quaint, quirky, and when it comes to romance, there's no place quite as enchanting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanie Barrett didn't mean to &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;. Spinning a story of a joyous marriage to make a dying woman happy is forgivable, isn't it? Lanie thinks so, especially since her beloved Aunt Ruby would have been heartbroken to know the truth of her niece's sadly loveless, short-of-sparkling existence. Trouble is, according to the will, Ruby didn't quite buy Lanie's tale. And to inherit the only house Lanie ever really considered a home, she'll have to bring her "husband" back to Charmed for three whole months--or watch Aunt Ruby's cozy nest go to her weasel cousin, who will sell it to a condo developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick McKane is out of work, out of luck, and the spitting image of the man Lanie described. He needs money for his daughter's art school tuition, and Lanie needs a convenient spouse. It's a match made... well, not quite in heaven, but for a temporary arrangement, it couldn't be better. Except the longer Lanie and Nick spend as husband and wife, the more the connection between them begins to seem real. Maybe this modern fairy tale really could come true...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>On a bracing autumn day in Door County, a prominent philanthropist disappears. Is the elderly Gerald Sneider—known as “Mr. Packer” for his legendary support of Green Bay football—suffering from dementia, or just avoiding his greedy son? Is there a connection to threats against the National Football League?&lt;br /&gt;             As tourists flood the peninsula for the fall colors, Sheriff Dave Cubiak’s search for Sneider is stymied by the FBI. When human bones wash up on the Lake Michigan shore, the sheriff has more than a missing man to worry about. With the media demanding answers and two puzzles to solve, Cubiak must follow his instincts down a trail of half-remembered rumors and local history to discover the shocking truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I swore I'd keep things friendly with the studly German soccer player I met in Madrid...until we ended up naked together on his living room floor #Screwed #PunIntended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FREDRIK&lt;br /&gt;Just friends…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s all I want to be with Rachel Collins, the sexy American student I meet at a party in my adopted hometown of Madrid. I’m looking for the real deal—someone who’ll stick around Spain for more than a semester—so I resolve to keep her at arm’s length. Even if she is gorgeous as hell. Smart. And as crazy about sports as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But friends don’t kiss. They don’t do sleepovers. And they definitely don’t get rug burn from having the best sex ever on the living room carpet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RACHEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our connection is instant. Intense. Fredrik has become the best friend I’ve ever had. The fact that he loves to cook breakfast for me is a plus. Especially when he cooks wearing nothing but his glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’ve got my dream internship waiting for me back in the states. And Fredrik is lining up a contract worth millions to stay in Madrid. We’re playing with fire to keep seeing each other like this. But how can we resist when the sex is so great—really, really freaking great—and the fun we have together is even better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LESSONS IN LOSING IT is a STANDALONE romance in the STUDY ABROAD series. The books in this series are complete standalones with interconnected characters, and can be read in any order.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An alternate title/cover for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36560370.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Kai Stanton laid eyes on Daiya, he knew something was special about her. But a haze surrounds them, and like a dark cloud, it shadows their relationship. What if his feelings aren't his own? Can he trust himself? Can he trust the girl he’s almost certain he’s falling in love with? With Kai’s father back and insistent on inserting himself into his life, everything starts to spin out of control. He doesn't know what—or who—to believe anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daiya Cattiva knew awakening would be difficult, but she had no idea she would find herself at the center of an ancient prophecy that could change everything. She knows her destiny is entwined with Kai’s, but how can she be sure what he feels is real and not just the allure of the demon inside her? Either way, Kai’s life hangs in the balance, and Daiya must make a choice: save Kai over the greater good, or be with Kai and risk her demon consuming him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one touch ... the next could be their last.</description>

  <description>Our professional and personal success depends upon our being assertive. We must stand up and speak out for ourselves. If we are passive, we will never achieve our goals and the success we desire. If we are aggressive, we will damage our professional and personal relationships. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book provides a new perspective on assertiveness. You will discover the costs of being passive, the costs of being aggressive, the benefits of being assertive, and how to find the delicate balance of assertiveness.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a wonderful children's book. The illustrations are adorable, and the story is sweet. It's the perfect bedtime story for someone to read to their little one. One thing I thought was great was not only is it a sweet story, but it's also interactive. On each page of the book there are "Grand...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN B06XCQF31K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll save you as many times as I have to, even if it means saving you from yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart pounds erratically as the crowd swells around us, panic thick in the air. This can’t be how I die, not here, not tonight. Through the throng of bodies, I can see him...Thane. Of all the ways I thought tonight would end, this wasn’t even on my list. Pain lances through me and I can tell by the look in his eyes that whatever just happened, it’s bad. My hand reaches for my leg and I find it sticky and wet with my own blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever happens, I know Thane will save me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screams, and blood, and tragedy haunt my dreams. I'm alive and I owe it all to the gorgeous former marine who refused to leave me for dead. But how can I start a new relationship when I'm not even sure who I am anymore?</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved this book. The characters were all great, and the story was really sweet. <br /><br />Even though the way they meet is through a terrible tragedy, the love that blooms from that event was really sweet, and I just couldn't put this one down. All the side characters were awesome as well. Looking forward...]]>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Connor works his butt off to maintain the golden-boy persona he’s created. He has the grades, the extracurriculars, the athletics, and a part-time job at his dad’s shop… every detail specifically chosen to ensure the college scholarships he needs to get the hell out of the Podunk town where he lives. The last thing he needs is an unexpected attraction to Graham, an eyeliner-wearing soccer phenom from St. Louis, who makes him question his goals and his sexuality. Sure, he’s noticed good-looking boys before—that doesn’t have to mean anything, right?—but he’s got a girlfriend. There’s no room on the agenda for hooking up with Graham, but the heart doesn’t always follow the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he and Graham grow close, other aspects of Connor’s life fall apart. Family pressure, bad luck, and rumors threaten to derail his carefully laid plans. Suddenly the future he’s fighting for doesn’t seem quite as alluring, especially if he has to deny who he really is to achieve it.</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow.... I really loved this book. It was a really amazing and well written YA m/m story. Graham seriously stole my heart throughout the entire book. He overcame so much, and survived to embrace who he is despite the hate that comes at him. His backstory just broke my heart, but he never shied awa...]]>
