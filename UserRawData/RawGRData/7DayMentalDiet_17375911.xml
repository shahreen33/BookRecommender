  <description>"Against Medical Advice is both harrowing and heartbreaking, but is also a story of astonishing courage. This book stands as a testament to the amazing power of one family's unconditional love for one another." &lt;br /&gt;-Tess Gerritsen, author of "The Bone Garden &lt;br /&gt;"One morning when he was almost five years old, Cory Friedman woke up with the uncontrollable urge to shake his head. From that day forward his life became an agony of irrepressible tics and involuntary utterances. Cory embarked on a thirteen-year odyssey of medication upon medication, treatment upon treatment-a constantly changing regimen that left him and his family feeling like guinea pigs in an out-of-control experiment. It soon became unclear which tics were symptoms of his condition and which were side effects of the countless combinations of drugs. The only certainty was that "it kept getting worse." Simply put: Cory Friedman's life was a living hell. &lt;br /&gt;Subjected to debilitating treatments and continuous ridicule, Cory became devastatingly aware of how he appeared to others. With the love of his family and the support of a few steadfast teachers and medical professionals, he fought for his very life, and you will cheer his amazing successes. &lt;br /&gt;Against Medical Advice is the true story of Cory's battle for survival in the face of extraordinary difficulties and a sometimes maddening medical establishment. Written by James Patterson and Cory's father, Hal, with the relentless pace of a Patterson thriller, this is a heartrending story of one family's courage, determination, and ultimate triumph.</description>

  <description>Donna VanLiere's books movingly portray ordinary people reaching for more meaningful lives. In &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Promise&lt;/i&gt;, she follows two seemingly separate individuals and shows how their lives intersect. Chaz McConnell realizes that his life is empty--and he's made it that way. He goes home every night to a bare apartment. For the first time in his life, he's working at a job that will last more than a few weeks, as security for Wilson's Department Store. Trying to reach out, he befriends 4-year-old Donovan, whose mother is part of the janitorial team at Wilson's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Bailey finds it easy to care for families in need but just can't seem to bridge the gap with her cantankerous neighbor, 60-something widow Miriam Lloyd Davies. When Miriam goes away for a week and a pipe bursts she comes home to a house under water. Gloria, in an act of kindness--or maybe insanity--invites Miriam to stay at her house until a hotel room becomes available. They eventually realize they have more in common than they ever thought. In this beautiful, deeply poignant novel, we are reminded that the past is never far behind and all of us are longing for a place to call home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From pastor and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Timothy Keller comes the perfect gift for the holidays—a profoundly moving and intellectually provocative examination of the Nativity story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even people who are not professing Christians think they are familiar with the story of the Nativity. Every Christmas displays of Jesus resting in a manger populate lawns and churchyards, and songs about shepherds and angels fill the air. Yet despite the abundance of these Christian references in popular culture, how many of us have examined the hard edges of this biblical story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his new book Timothy Keller takes readers on an illuminating journey into the surprising background of the Nativity. By understanding the message of hope and salvation within the Bible’s account of Jesus’s birth, readers will experience the redeeming power of God’s grace in a meaningful and deeper way.</description>

  <description>From the author who's inspired millions worldwide with books like "Tuesdays with Morrie" and "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" comes his most imaginative novel yet, "The Time Keeper"--a compelling fable about the first man on earth to count the hours. The man who became Father Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Mitch Albom's newest work of fiction, the inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who come after him seeking more days, more years. Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He returns to our world--now dominated by the hour-counting he so innocently began--and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: one a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, the other a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself, he must save them both. And stop the world to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in Albom's signature spare, evocative prose, this remarkably original tale will inspire readers everywhere to reconsider their own notions of time, how they spend it and how precious it truly is.</description>

  <description>3 hours, 50 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her disarming, intimate, completely accessible voice, and dry sense of humor, Nora Ephron shares with us her ups and downs in &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck&lt;/i&gt;, a candid, hilarious look at women who are getting older and dealing with the tribulations of maintenance, menopause, empty nests, and life itself.&lt;br /&gt;The woman who brought us &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally . . . &lt;/i&gt;discusses everything–from how much she hates her purse to how much time she spends attempting to stop the clock: the hair dye, the treadmill, the lotions and creams that promise to slow the aging process but never do. Oh, and she can’t stand the way her neck looks. But her dermatologist tells her there’s no quick fix for that.&lt;br /&gt;Ephron chronicles her life, but mostly she speaks frankly and uproariously about life as a woman of a certain age.&lt;br /&gt;Utterly courageous, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly moving in its truth telling, &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck&lt;/i&gt; is an audiobook of wisdom, advice, and laugh-out-loud moments, a scrumptious, irresistible treat.</description>

Oh, and she can't stand the way her neck looks. But her dermatologist tells her there's no quick fix for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ephron chronicles her life as an obsessed cook, passionate city dweller, and hapless parent. She recounts her anything-but-glamorous days as a White House intern during the JFK years ("I am probably the only young woman who ever worked in the Kennedy White House that the President did not make a pass at") and shares how she fell in and out of love with Bill Clinton--from a distance, of course. But mostly she speaks frankly and uproariously about life as a woman of a certain age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly courageous, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly moving in its truth telling, &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck&lt;/i&gt; is a book of wisdom, advice, and laugh-out-loud moments, a scrumptious, irresistible treat.</description>

  <description>As a creative force, student of the human heart and soul, and champion of living the life you want, Oprah Winfrey stands alone. Over the years, she has made history with a legendary talk show - the highest-rated program of its kind, launched her own television network, become the nation's only African-American billionaire, and been awarded both an honorary degree by Harvard University and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. From all her experiences, she has gleaned life lessons—which, for fourteen years, she's shared in &lt;i&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine's&lt;/i&gt; widely popular "What I Know For Sure" column, a monthly source of inspiration and revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time, these thoughtful gems have been revised, updated, and collected in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure,&lt;/i&gt; a beautiful cloth bound book with a ribbon marker, packed with insight and revelation from Oprah Winfrey. Organized by theme—joy, resilience, connection, gratitude, possibility, awe, clarity, and power—these essays offer a rare, powerful and intimate glimpse into the heart and mind of one of the world's most extraordinary women—while providing readers a guide to becoming their best selves. Candid, moving, exhilarating, uplifting, and frequently humorous, the words Oprah shares in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure&lt;/i&gt; shimmer with the sort of truth that readers will turn to again and again.</description>

  <description>Grace, dignity, and eloquence have long been hallmarks of Maya Angelou’s poetry. Her measured verses have stirred our souls, energized our minds, and healed our hearts. Whether offering hope in the darkest of nights or expressing sincere joy at the extraordinariness of the everyday, Maya Angelou has served as our common voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Celebrations &lt;/i&gt;is a collection of timely and timeless poems that are an integral part of the global fabric. Several works have become nearly as iconic as Angelou herself: the inspiring “On the Pulse of Morning,” read at President William Jefferson Clinton’s 1993 inauguration; the heartening “Amazing Peace,” presented at the 2005 lighting of the National Christmas Tree at the White House; “A Brave and Startling Truth,” which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations; and “Mother,” which beautifully honors the first woman in our lives. Angelou writes of celebrations public and private, a bar mitzvah wish to her nephew, a birthday greeting to Oprah Winfrey, and a memorial tribute to the late Luther Vandross and Barry White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a writer, Angelou is a chronicler of history, an advocate for peace, and a champion for the planet, as well as a patriot, a mentor, and a friend. To be shared and cherished, the wisdom and poetry of Maya Angelou proves there is always cause for celebration.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the ebullient spirit of &lt;i&gt;Ocean's 8, The Heist&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/i&gt;, a sensational and entertaining memoir of the world's most notorious jewel thief-a woman who defied society's prejudices and norms to carve her own path, stealing from elite jewelers to live her dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up during the Depression in the segregated coal town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, Doris Payne was told her dreams were unattainable for poor black girls like her. Surrounded by people who sought to limit her potential, Doris vowed to turn the tables after the owner of a jewelry store threw her out when a white customer arrived. Neither racism nor poverty would hold her back; she would get what she wanted and help her mother escape an abusive relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using her southern charm, quick wit, and fascination with magic as her tools, Payne began shoplifting small pieces of jewelry from local stores. Over the course of six decades, her talents grew with each heist. Becoming an expert world-class jewel thief, she daringly pulled off numerous diamond robberies and her Jewish boyfriend fenced the stolen gems to Hollywood celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doris's criminal exploits went unsolved well into the 1970s-partly because the stores did not want to admit that they were duped by a black woman. Eventually realizing Doris was using him, her boyfriend turned her in. She was arrested after stealing a diamond ring in Monte Carlo that was valued at more than half a million dollars. But even prison couldn't contain this larger-than-life personality who cleverly used nuns as well as various ruses to help her break out. With her arrest in 2013 in San Diego, Doris's fame skyrocketed when media coverage of her astonishing escapades exploded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, at eighty-seven, Doris, as bold and vibrant as ever, lives in Atlanta, and is celebrated for her glamorous legacy. She sums up her adventurous career best: It beat being a teacher or a maid. A rip-roaringly fun and exciting story as captivating and audacious as &lt;i&gt;Catch Me if You Can&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Can You Ever Forgive Me?-Diamond Doris&lt;/i&gt; is the portrait of a captivating anti-hero who refused to be defined by the prejudices and mores of a hypocritical society.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the remarkable life of the British abolitionist William Wilberforce (1759-1833). This accessible biography chronicles Wilberforce's extraordinary role as a human rights activist, cultural reformer, and member of Parliament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the center of this heroic life was a passionate twenty-year fight to abolish the British slave trade, a battle Wilberforce won in 1807, as well as efforts to abolish slavery itself in the British colonies, a victory achieved just three days before his death in 1833.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Metaxas discovers in this unsung hero a man of whom it can truly be said: he changed the world. Before Wilberforce, few thought slavery was wrong. After Wilberforce, most societies in the world came to see it as a great moral wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the British slave trade, HarperSanFrancisco and Bristol Bay Productions have joined together to commemorate the life of William Wilberforce with the feature-length film &lt;i&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/i&gt; and this companion biography, which provides a fuller account of the amazing life of this great man than can be captured on film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This account of Wilberforce's life will help many become acquainted with an exceptional man who was a hero to Abraham Lincoln and an inspiration to the anti-slavery movement in America.</description>

  <description>"I've had a most amazing time..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So begins the Time Traveler's astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H. G. Wells's successful career and earned him the reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine's lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth. There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells's expert storytelling and provocative insight, &lt;i&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/i&gt; will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.</description>

  <description>Hilarious and heartfelt observations on aging from one of America's favorite comedians, now that he's 65, and a look back at a remarkable career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy Crystal is 65, and he's not happy about it. With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like "Buying the Plot" and "Nodding Off," Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, and his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/i&gt;, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listeners get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever "test positive for Maalox"), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion ("the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac"); grandparenting; and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal's reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still Foolin' 'Em&lt;/i&gt; includes a portion recorded in front of a live studio audience.</description>

  <description>They are the troops that nobody wants to see, carrying a message that no military family ever wants to hear. It begins with a knock at the door. "The curtains pull away. They come to the door. And they know. They always know," says Major Steve Beck. &lt;br /&gt;Since the start of the war in Iraq, Marines like Major Beck have found themselves thrown into a different kind of mission: casualty notification. It is a job Major Beck never asked for and one for which he received no training. He is given no set rules, only impersonal guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;Marines are trained to kill, but casualty notification is a mission without weapons. For Beck, the mission meant learning each dead Marine's name and nickname, touching the toys he grew up with, and reading the letters he wrote home. Major Beck has held grieving mothers in long embraces, absorbing their muffled cries into the dark blue shoulder of his uniform. He stitched himself into the fabric of their lives, in the simple hope that his compassion might help alleviate at least the smallest piece of their pain. &lt;br /&gt;In FINAL SALUTE," " Pulitzer prize--winning journalist Jim Sheeler weaves together the stories of the fallen and of the broken homes they have left behind. It is a moving tribute to our troops, putting faces to the mostly anonymous names of our courageous heroes and to the brave families who have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. FINAL SALUTE is the achingly beautiful, devastatingly honest story of the true toll of war. &lt;br /&gt;Some of the material in this book has appeared in a different form in the Rocky Mountain News and that material is copyright to the Rocky Mountain News.</description>

  <description>Your world, and even your self, is largely constructed from the thoughts and feelings, people and things you’ve focused on throughout your life. Much more than you probably suspect, you can, as you move forward, actively direct your attention to create the kind of experience you want and become the person you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from the latest research in neuroscience and psychology, Rapt illuminates attention’s essential function: transforming the vast, chaotic world into your own orderly, user-friendly personal version. Your brain’s selective gatekeeper, it’s involved in virtually every aspect of life—learning and memory, thought and emotion, work and relationships. As the expression ‘paying attention’ suggests, you have a limited store of this cognitive currency, which you should invest wisely, because the stakes are high. On the deepest level, what you focus on can literally change your brain, and thus your behavior. On the experiential level, taking charge of your attention is the key to personal power and freedom—and the hallmark of the successful and satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with organizing your internal and external worlds, attention opens the doors to the sublime experience best described as ‘rapt.’ By cultivating this ability to be completely engrossed—whether by rolling waves or a soaring aria, by rearranging your furniture or writing a poem—you improve your capacity for concentration, broaden your inner horizons, lift your spirits, and most important, feel what it means to be fully alive.</description>

  <description>An early-morning workout becomes an enchanting adventure when a record-holding swimmer reunites a baby whale and its mother. An inspiring, irresistible story for all ages, from the beloved author of &lt;i&gt;Swimming to Antarctica&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's five o'clock in the morning and still dark. Swimming outside the wave break off the Catalina coast, training for her next long-distance swim (she has already crossed the English Channel twice), 17-year-old Lynne Cox senses that something is following her. She worries that it might be a great white shark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it's a baby gray whale, separated from its mother on their journey to the Bering Sea 8,000 miles away. Lynne needs to leave the water to rest, but she knows that if she does, the calf will follow her onto shore and die. To save its life, she must reunite mother and calf in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miracles happen now and then. Sometimes we recognize them when they occur; sometimes it takes years of experience to understand. Looking back on that chilly morning, a beloved author and inspirational speaker shares her personal story of love, hope, loss, and faith.</description>

  <description>In 2008 an extraordinary two-minute film clip appeared on YouTube and immediately became an international phenomenon. It captures the moving reunion of two young men and their pet lion Christian, after they had left him in Africa with &lt;i&gt;Born Free’s &lt;/i&gt;George Adamson to introduce him into his rightful home in the wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Lion Called Christian &lt;/i&gt;tells the remarkable story of how Anthony “Ace” Bourke and John Rendall, visitors to London from Australia in 1969, bought the boisterous lion cub in the pet department of Harrods. For several months, the three of them shared a flat above a furniture shop on London’s King’s Road, where the charismatic and intelligent Christian quickly became a local celebrity, cruising the streets in the back of a Bentley, popping in for lunch at a local restaurant, even posing for a fashion advertisement. But the lion cub was growing up—&lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;—and soon even the walled church garden where he went for exercise wasn’t large enough for him. How could Ace and John avoid having to send Christian to a zoo for the rest of his life? A coincidental meeting with English actors Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, stars of the hit film &lt;i&gt;Born Free&lt;/i&gt;, led to Christian being flown to Kenya and placed under the expert care of “the father of lions” George Adamson. Incredibly, when Ace and John returned to Kenya to see Christian a year later, they received a loving welcome from their lion, who was by then fully integrated into Africa and a life with other lions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 1971, and now fully revised and updated with more than 50 photographs of Christian from cuddly cub in London to magnificent lion in Africa,&lt;i&gt; A Lion Called Christian &lt;/i&gt;is a touching and uplifting true story of an indelible human-animal bond. It is is destined to become one of the great classics of animal literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Liberator&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Avenue of Spies&lt;/i&gt; returns with a thrilling, action-heavy account of D-Day combat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning in the predawn darkness of June 6, 1944, &lt;i&gt;The First Wave&lt;/i&gt; follows ten men attempting to carry out D-Day's most critical missions. Their actions would determine the fate of the invasion of Hitler's Fortress Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ten make a charismatic, unforgettable cast. They include the first American paratrooper to touch down on Normandy soil; the only British soldier that day to earn a Victoria Cross; the Canadian brothers who led their decimated troops onto Juno Beach under withering fire; the colonel who faced the powerful 150-mm guns of the Merville Battery; as well as a French commando who helped destroy German strongholds on Sword Beach. This book will give authentic voice to the invaders' enemies--the German-enlisted men and officers tasked with destroying the Allies as they hit the beaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is an utterly immersive, adrenaline-driven drama, an epic of close combat and extraordinary heroism. It is the capstone Alex Kershaw's remarkable career, built on his close friendships with D-Day survivors and his intimate understanding of the Normandy battlefield. For the seventy-fifth anniversary, here is a fresh take on World War II's longest day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running time: 8.72 hours</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Hollis, #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bestselling author of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Girl, Wash Your Face&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and host of the top-rated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;podcast, urges women to stop apologizing for their desires, hopes, and dreams and instead to go after them with passion and confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Hollis has seen it too often: women being afraid of their own goals. They’re afraid of embarrassment, of falling short of perfection, of not being enough. But the biggest fear of all is of being judged for having ambition at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been taught to define themselves in light of other people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, friend, or team member—many women have forgotten who they are and what they were meant to be. In &lt;em&gt;Girl, Stop Apologizing&lt;/em&gt;, entrepreneur and online personality (TheChicSite.com) Rachel Hollis encourages women to own their hopes, desires, and goals and reminds them they don’t need permission to want more. With a call to women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to let go of, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to growth, confidence, and the biggest possible version of their lives.</description>

  <description>Deepak Chopra has discovered the delights—and frustrations—of golf, and he is passionate about the game. Confronted by the wild ups and downs of his own play, he consulted with golf professionals and developed a new approach to the game that any golfer can follow—from the novice to the expert. The results can be measured not only in increased enjoyment and skill, but also in greater wisdom about life beyond the 18th hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chopra’s own game has improved dramatically since incorporating the elements of his program. Instead of focusing on the mechanics of a “perfect” swing, Chopra reveals how golf can be mastered through mindfulness, a form of awareness that combines sharp focus and relaxation at the same time. Expanded awareness, he tells us, can accomplish much more than external mechanics to improve one’s game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;b&gt;Golf for Enlightenment&lt;/b&gt; is also an engrossing story about Adam, an Everyman who is playing a terrible round of golf when he meets a mysterious young teaching pro named Leela. In seven short but profound lessons detailing spiritual strategies, she teaches Adam the essence of a game that has much to explain about life itself.&lt;br /&gt;Chopra has spent the last year taking the unique message in &lt;b&gt;Golf for Enlightenment&lt;/b&gt; nationwide, teaching the essential tenets of his program at lectures and seminars to golfers everywhere. His message continues to help players turn an obsession into a positive life path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  The true story of an incredible disaster and heroic rescue at sea told by two masterful storytellers
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 1952, New England was battered by the most brutal nor'easter in years. As the weather wreaked havoc on land, the freezing Atlantic became a wind-whipped zone of peril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of Monday, February 18, while the storm raged, two oil tankers, the &lt;i&gt;Pendleton&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Fort Mercer&lt;/i&gt;, found themselves in the same horrifying predicament. Built with "dirty steel," and not prepared to withstand such ferocious seas, both tankers split in two, leaving the dozens of men on board utterly at the Atlantic's mercy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Finest Hours&lt;/i&gt; is the gripping, true story of the valiant attempt to rescue the souls huddling inside the broken halves of the two ships. Coast Guard cutters raced to the aid of those on the &lt;i&gt;Fort Mercer&lt;/i&gt;, and when it became apparent that the halves of the &lt;i&gt;Pendleton&lt;/i&gt; were in danger of capsizing, the Guard sent out two thirty-six-foot lifeboats as well. These wooden boats, manned by only four seamen, were dwarfed by the enormous seventy-foot seas. As the tiny rescue vessels set out from the coast of Cape Cod, the men aboard were all fully aware that they were embarking on what could easily become a suicide mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spellbinding tale is overflowing with breathtaking scenes that sear themselves into the mind's eye, as boats capsize, bows and sterns crash into one another, and men hurl themselves into the raging sea in their terrifying battle for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the eighty-four men caught at sea in the midst of that brutal storm survived, but considering the odds, it's a miracle -- and a testament to their bravery -- that any came home to tell their tales at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman have seamlessly woven together their extensive research and firsthand interviews to create an unforgettable tale of heroism, triumph, and tragedy, one that truly tells of the Coast Guard's finest hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A gripping true account of courage and survival at sea against impossible odds—and one of the finest untold World War II sagas of our time. In December 1944, while on a mission to support MacArthur's invasion of the Philippines, Admiral William "Bull" Halsey unwittingly steered his fleet of 170 ships into the teeth of a massive typhoon. The storm ultimately inflicted twice as much destruction and loss of life as the Battle of Midway, but Navy brass suppressed the scope of the disaster so as not to compromise the American advance on Tokyo. After the ensuing Court of Inquiry, Halsey never spoke again of the disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only now, thanks to documents declassified sixty years after the events and scores of firsthand accounts from survivors, that the story finally has been told.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ISABEL DALHOUSIE - Book 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nothing captures the charm of Edinburgh like the bestselling Isabel Dalhousie series of novels featuring the insatiably curious philosopher and woman detective. Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction's most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life's questions, large and small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel's son, Charlie, is now of an age--eighteen months--to have a social life, and so off they go to a birthday party, where, much to Isabel's surprise, she encounters an old adversary, Minty Auchterlonie, now a high-flying financier. Minty had seemed to Isabel a woman of ruthless ambition, but the question of her integrity had never been answered. Now, when Minty takes Isabel into her confidence about a personal matter, Isabel finds herself going another round: Is Minty to be trusted? Or is she the perpetrator of an enormous financial fraud? And what should Isabel make of the rumors of shady financial transactions at Minty's investment bank?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this is the only dilemma facing Isabel: she also crosses swords again with her nemesis, Professor Dove, in an argument over plagiarism. Of course her niece, Cat, has a new, problematic man (a tightrope walker!) in her life. And there remains the open question of marriage to Jamie--doting father of Charlie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there is no end to the delight in accompanying Isabel as she makes her way toward the heart of every problem: philosophizing, sleuthing, and downright snooping in her inimitable--and inimitably charming--fashion.</description>

  <description>With this “impeccable” (&lt;em&gt;BBC History&lt;/em&gt;) chronicle, acclaimed popular historian Ruth Goodman reveals a Renaissance Britain particularly rank with troublemakers. From snooty needlers who took aim with a cutting “thee,” to lowbrow drunkards with revolting table manners, Goodman’s “gleeful and illuminating” (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;, starred review) portrait of offenses most foul draws upon advice manuals, court cases, and sermons. Wicked readers will delight in learning why quoting Shakespeare was poor form, and why curses hurled at women were almost always about sex (&lt;em&gt;no surprise there&lt;/em&gt;). “Accessible, fun, and historically accurate” (&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, starred review), &lt;em&gt;How to Behave Badly&lt;/em&gt; is a celebration of one of history’s naughtiest periods, when derision was an art form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, how I wish Ruth Goodman could be my tutor. But settling in for one of her history lessons is better than second best.” — Alicia Becker, &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deeply personal and never-before-told account of one of America's darkest days, from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Admirals&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MacArthur at War&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; The surprise attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 remains one of the most traumatic events in American history. America's battleship fleet was crippled, thousands of lives were lost, and the United States was propelled into a world war. Few realize that aboard the iconic, ill-fated USS Arizona were an incredible 79 blood relatives. Tragically, in an era when family members serving together was an accepted, even encouraged, practice, sixty-three of the Arizona's 1,177 dead turned out to be brothers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Brothers Down&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed historian Walter R. Borneman returns to that critical week of December, masterfully guiding us on an unforgettable journey of sacrifice and heroism, all told through the lives of these brothers and their fateful experience on the Arizona. Weaving in the heartbreaking stories of the parents, wives, and sweethearts who wrote to and worried about these men, Borneman draws from a treasure trove of unpublished source material to bring to vivid life the minor decisions that became a matter of life or death when the bombs began to fall. More than just an account of familial bonds and national heartbreak, what emerges promises to define a turning point in American military history.</description>

  <description>Ben Macintyre’s &lt;i&gt;Agent Zigzag &lt;/i&gt;was hailed as “rollicking, spellbinding” (&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;), “wildly improbable but entirely true” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;), and, quite simply, “the best book ever written” (&lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;). In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Operation Mincemeat&lt;/i&gt;, he tells an extraordinary story that will delight his legions of fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1943, from a windowless basement office in London, two brilliant intelligence officers conceived a plan that was both simple and complicated— Operation Mincemeat. The purpose? To deceive the Nazis into thinking that Allied forces were planning to attack southern Europe by way of Greece or Sardinia, rather than Sicily, as the Nazis had assumed, and the Allies ultimately chose.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charles Cholmondeley of MI5 and the British naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu could not have been more different. Cholmondeley was a dreamer seeking adventure. Montagu was an aristocratic, detail-oriented barrister. But together they were the perfect team and created an ingenious plan: Get a corpse, equip it with secret (but false and misleading) papers concerning the invasion, then drop it off the coast of Spain where German spies would, they hoped, take the bait. The idea was approved by British intelligence officials, including Ian Fleming (creator of James Bond). Winston Churchill believed it might ring true to the Axis and help bring victory to the Allies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with spies, double agents, rogues, fearless heroes, and one very important corpse, the story of Operation Mincemeat reads like an international thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unveiling never-before-released material, Ben Macintyre brings the reader right into the minds of intelligence officers, their moles and spies, and the German Abwehr agents who suffered the “twin frailties of wishfulness and yesmanship.” He weaves together the eccentric personalities of Cholmondeley and Montagu and their near-impossible feats into a riveting adventure that not only saved thousands of lives but paved the way for a pivotal battle in Sicily and, ultimately, Allied success in the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Emmy and Grammy Award–winner’s candid, spectacularly amusing memoir of his years in stand-up. Nominated for the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mid-seventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. &lt;i&gt;Born Standing Up&lt;/i&gt; is, in his own words, the story of "why I did stand-up and why I walked away."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times: the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of &lt;i&gt;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&lt;/i&gt; in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; in the seventies.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Multiple hankies, dog lovers…this is an emotional read." –&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's been a theme in Justine Meade's life, it's loss. Her mother, her home, even her son. The one bright spot in her loss-filled life, the partner she could always count on, was Mack, her grey and black Sheltie – that is, until she is summoned back to her childhood home after more than twenty years away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed and Alice Parmalee are mourning a loss of their own. Seven years after their daughter was taken from them, they're living separate lives together. Dancing around each other, and their unspeakable heartbreak, unable to bridge the chasm left between them. When they find a little black and gray dog by the side of the road, they take him in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal, acutely perceptive and guided by a herd dog's instinct, Mack has a way of bringing out the best in his humans. Whether it's as Justine's partner, or just the ebb and flow of a family's rhythms, it's as though the little Shetland Sheepdog was born to bring people together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs Mack. But to whom does the little dog who danced belong?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of how Pete Rose became one of the greatest and most controversial players in the history of baseball&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete Rose was a legend on the field. As baseball's Hit King, he shattered a number of hitting records that may never be broken. And during the 1970s, he was the leader of the Big Red Machine, the Cincinnati Reds teams that dominated the game. But he's also the greatest player who may never make the Hall of Fame because of his lifetime ban from the sport. Perhaps no other athlete's story is so representative of the triumphs and tragedies of our national pastime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Play Hungry&lt;/i&gt;, Rose tells us the story of how through hard work, hustle, and sheer will he became one of the unlikeliest stars of the game. Guided by the dad he idolized, a local sports hero with the spirit of a champion, Pete had an All-American boyhood. But even with the coaching of his father on how to compete and play baseball the right way, Pete was cut from his team as a teenager--he wasn't a natural. By the time scouts were coming to his high school games, he wasn't even considered the best player on the team. Rose was determined, though, and never would be satisfied with anything less than success. His relentless hustle and headfirst style would help him overcome his natural shortcomings, leading to a storied career including the Rookie of the Year Award, three batting titles, and the MVP Award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Play Hungry&lt;/i&gt; is Pete Rose's love letter to the game, and an inside story of life on the diamond. He is one of the last players from a golden age in baseball, and he describes just what it was like to hit (or try to hit) a Sandy Koufax curveball or Bob Gibson fastball, what happened in that infamous collision at home plate during the 1970 All-Star Game, and what it felt like to topple Ty Cobb's hit record. And finally, he speaks to how he let down his fans, his teammates, and the memory of his dad when he gambled on baseball, breaking the rules of a sport that he loved more than anything else in his life. Told with candor and wry humor, Rose's memoir is his final word on the glories and controversies of his life, including tales he's never told before, and a master class in how to succeed when the odds are stacked against you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time, legendary performer Roy Orbison's story as one of the most beloved rock legends will be revealed through family accounts and records.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Roy Orbison is a rock and roll icon almost without peer. He came of age as an artist on the venerable Sun Records label; toured with The Beatles; had massive hits in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s; invented the black-clad, sunglasses-wearing image of the rock star; and reinvented the art of songwriting many times over. He is a member of the Rock &amp;amp; Roll and Songwriters Halls of Fame, a recipient of the Musicians Hall of Fame's inaugural Iconic Riff Award, and the winner of multiple GRAMMY(R) awards. He is known the world over for hits like "Blue Bayou," "You Got It," and "Oh, Pretty Woman" and was a member of the band that inspired the term "supergroup"-the Traveling Wilburys, with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Tom Petty. Despite these and countless other accolades, the story of Roy Orbison's life is virtually unknown to his millions of fans around the world. Now, for the first time ever, the Orbison Estate, headed by Roy's sons, Wesley, Roy Jr., and Alex Orbison, has set out to set the record straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Authorized Roy Orbison tells the epic tale of a West Texas boy, drawn to the guitar at age six, whose monumental global career successes were matched at nearly every turn by extraordinary personal tragedies, including the loss of his first wife in a motorcycle accident and his two oldest sons in a fire. It's a story of the intense highs and severe lows that make up the mountain range of Roy Orbison's career; one that touched four decades and ended abruptly at perhaps its highest peak, when he passed away at the age of fifty-two on December 6, 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with hundreds of photographs, many never before seen, gathered from across the globe and uncovered from deep within the Orbison Vault, The Authorized Roy Orbison shows Roy Orbison as a young child and follows him all the way through to the peak of his stardom and up to his tragic end. Wesley, Roy Jr., and Alex Orbison-Roy's Boys-have left no stone unturned in order to illustrate the people, places, things, and events that forged their father, the man behind those famous sunglasses.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“&lt;/i&gt;One Good Dog &lt;i&gt;is a wonderful novel: a moving, tender, and brilliantly crafted story about two fighters—one a man, one a dog— hoping to leave the fight behind, who ultimately find their salvation in each other. Susan Wilson’s clear and unflinching style is perfectly suited for her story that strips away the trappings and toys we all hide behind, and exposes our essential need to give and accept love in order to thrive.”—Garth Stein, &lt;/i&gt;New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;/i&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adam March is a self-made “Master of the Universe.” He has it all: the beautiful wife, the high-powered job, the glittering circle of friends. But there is a price to be paid for all these trappings, and the pressure is mounting—until the day Adam makes a fatal mistake. His assistant leaves him a message with three words: &lt;i&gt;your sister called. &lt;/i&gt;What no one knows is that Adam’s sister has been missing for decades. That she represents the excruciatingly painful past he has left behind. And that her absence has secretly tormented him all these years. When his assistant brushes off his request for an explanation in favor of her more pressing personal call, Adam loses it. And all hell breaks loose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam is escorted from the building. He loses his job. He loses his wife. He loses the life he’s worked so hard to achieve. He doesn’t believe it is possible to sink any lower when he is assigned to work in a soup kitchen as a form of community service. But unbeknownst to Adam, this is where his life will intersect with Chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chance is a mixed breed Pit Bull. He’s been born and raised to fight and seldom leaves the dirty basement where he is kept between fights. But Chance is not a victim or a monster. It is Chance’s unique spirit that helps him escape and puts him in the path of Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What transpires is the story of one man, one dog, and how they save each other—in ways they never could have expected.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Professor and the Madman&lt;/strong&gt;, masterfully researched and eloquently written, is an extraordinary tale of madness, genius, and the incredible obsessions of two remarkable men that led to the making of the Oxford English Dictionary -- and literary history. The compilation of the OED, begun in 1857, was one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken. As definitions were collected, the overseeing committee, led by Professor James Murray, discovered that one man, Dr. W.C. Minor, had submitted more than ten thousand. When the committee insisted on honoring him, a shocking truth came to light: Dr. Minor, an American Civil War veteran, was also an inmate at an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This audio also includes a conversation between Simon Winchester and John Simpson, editor of the Oxford English Dictionary</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this heartwarming novel, author Greg Kincaid tells the tender story of how one very special dog changed the lives of his adoptive family—and an entire town—forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Todd, they always want you to adopt a dog. That’s what they do. Besides, we don’t need another animal around here, and most definitely not a dog.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;When Todd McCray, a developmentally challenged young man still living on his parents’ Kansas farm, hears that a local animal shelter is seeking temporary homes for its dogs during the days leading to Christmas, he knows exactly what he wants for the holidays. His father objects, but Todd’s persistence quickly wins out. Soon the McCrays are the short-term foster family for a lovable pooch the young man names &lt;i&gt;Christmas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about all the other dogs who will be forced to spend the Yuletide season in cages? In the days that follow, Todd uses his special gifts of persuasion to encourage his hometown to participate in the “Adopt a Dog for Christmas Program.” What follows from his small act of kindness will teach his family, and his community, about peace on earth and good will toward men—and animals.</description>

  <description>It's the expose to end all exposes--the truth about the suburbs: where they planted trees and crabgrass came up, where they planted the schools and taxes came up, where they died of old age trying to merge onto the freeway and where they finally got sex out of the schools and back into the gutters.</description>

  <description>As one of America’s most recognized faces, Kathie Lee Gifford has been a part of our morning routine for more years than she cares to count. And that’s why it may come as a surprise to hear that there are still sides of this fiftysomething (!) devoted mother and dedicated television personality yet to be revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just When I Thought I’d Dropped My Last Egg &lt;/b&gt;is Kathie Lee’s triumphant, laugh-out-loud celebration of forging ahead with gusto, even long after we’re old enough to know better. Over the years, Kathie Lee has learned a lot about life and about herself. Age, for instance, isn’t a number, it’s a state of mind, and being fertile isn’t just about having babies. Perhaps most important: Our quality of life is sustained by our passions–how we express, define, and even reinvent ourselves at any age, through our careers, interests, friends, and beliefs. It’s never too late to set new goals for yourself and strive to meet them, to dust off your childhood dreams and pursue them again, to wake up every morning hoping to learn something new. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this riotous collection of musings, observations, and life lessons, Kathie Lee shares her thoughts about marriage, parenthood, friendship, faith, pet peeves, senior moments, and how to extricate oneself from potentially hairy situations with self-deprecating wit. Writing with the candor of a friend who knows where the bodies are buried, Kathie Lee reveals the truth every woman of a certain age knows but won’t admit: that we love our kids every second of every day but are counting the minutes till they’re ready to go off to college, that even though gravity is a constant force, not all parts of our bodies droop at the same rate, and that life and show business share one simple rule: “Don’t sit by the phone and wait for a man or a job.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of warmth, humor, down-to-earth wisdom, and more than a little bit of dish, &lt;b&gt;Just When I Thought I’d Dropped My Last Egg&lt;/b&gt; is a delectable read for grown-ups of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>3 Hours and 57 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this enchanting sequel to the number one bestseller The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Mitch Albom tells the story of Eddie’s heavenly reunion with Annie—the little girl he saved on earth—in an unforgettable novel of how our lives and losses intersect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years ago, in Mitch Albom’s beloved novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the world fell in love with Eddie, a grizzled war veteran- turned-amusement park mechanic who died saving the life of a young girl named Annie. Eddie’s journey to heaven taught him that every life matters. Now, in this magical sequel, Mitch Albom reveals Annie’s story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accident that killed Eddie left an indelible mark on Annie. It took her left hand, which needed to be surgically reattached. Injured, scarred, and unable to remember why, Annie’s life is forever changed by a guilt-ravaged mother who whisks her away from the world she knew. Bullied by her peers and haunted by something she cannot recall, Annie struggles to find acceptance as she grows. When, as a young woman, she reconnects with Paulo, her childhood love, she believes she has finally found happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel opens, Annie is marrying Paulo. But when her wedding night day ends in an unimaginable accident, Annie finds herself on her own heavenly journey—and an inevitable reunion with Eddie, one of the five people who will show her how her life mattered in ways she could not have fathomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and beautiful, filled with unexpected twists, The Next Person You Meet in Heaven reminds us that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a beginning—we only need to open our eyes to see it.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Invention of Air&lt;/em&gt; is a story of sweeping historical transformation, of genius and friendship, violence and world-changing ideas, that boldly recasts our understanding of the most significant events in our history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It centers on the story of Joseph Priestley—scientist and minister, protégé of Benjamin Franklin, friend of Thomas Jefferson—an eighteenth-century radical thinker who played key roles in the invention of ecosystem science, the discovery of oxygen, the founding of the Unitarian church, and the intellectual development of the United States. Priestley represented a unique synthesis: by the 1780s, he had established himself as one of the world's most celebrated scientists, most prominent religious figures, and most outspoken political thinkers. Yet he would also have become one of the most hated men in all of his native England. When an angry mob burned down his house in Birmingham, Priestley and his family set sail for Pennsylvania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the nascent United States, Priestley hoped to find the freedom to bridge the disciplines that had governed his life, to find a quiet lab and a receptive pulpit. Once he arrived, as a result of his close relationships with the Founding Fathers—Jefferson credited Priestley as the man who prevented him from abandoning Christianity—Priestley found himself at the center of what would go down as one of the seminal debates in American history. And as Johnson brilliant charts, Priestley exerted profound if little-known influence on the shape and course of this great experiment in nation-building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in his most recent bestselling work, &lt;em&gt;The Ghost Map&lt;/em&gt;, Steven Johnson here uses a dramatic historical story to explore themes that have long engaged him: innovation and the way new ideas emerge and spread, and the environments that foster these breakthroughs. As he did in &lt;em&gt;Everything Bad is Good for You&lt;/em&gt;, he upsets some fundamental assumptions about the world we live in—namely, what it means when we invoke the Founding Fathers—and replaces them with a clear-eyed, eloquent assessment of where we stand today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It-girl Betty White delivers a hilarious, slyly profound take on love, life, celebrity, and everything in between. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Drawing from a lifetime of lessons learned, seven-time Emmy winner Betty White's wit and wisdom take center stage as she tackles topics like friendship, romantic love, aging, television, fans, love for animals, and the brave new world of celebrity. &lt;i&gt;If You Ask Me&lt;/i&gt; mixes her thoughtful observations with humorous stories from a seven- decade career in Hollywood. Longtime fans and new fans alike will relish Betty's candid take on everything from her rumored crush on Robert Redford (true) to her beauty regimen ("I have no idea what color my hair is and I never intend to find out") to the Facebook campaign that helped persuade her to host &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; despite her having declined the hosting job three times already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Featuring all-new material, with a focus on the past fifteen years of her life, &lt;i&gt;If You Ask Me&lt;/i&gt; is funny, sweet, and to the point-just like Betty White.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debbie Macomber brings us to the Alaskan wilderness for a magical Christmas tale about finding love where it's least expected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning her dream job as sous chef in one of Seattle's hottest new restaurants, Josie Avery takes a summer position cooking at a lakeside lodge in the remote Alaskan town of Ponder. Josie falls for the rustic charms of the local community--including Jack Corcoran, the crotchety keeper of Ponder's famed sourdough starter, and, in particular, the quiet and intense Palmer Saxon, a famed master swordsmith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie and Palmer become close during the long Alaskan summer days, but Josie knows that, come fall, she'll be returning to reality and the career she's worked so hard for. Palmer, on the other hand, would like nothing better than to make Josie his wife and to keep her in Ponder. But Josie can't imagine abandoning her mother back in the Emerald City and sacrificing her career to stay in this isolated town--not even for a man she's quickly coming to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate has other plans. Josie misses the last boat out of town before winter sets in, stranding her in Ponder and putting her dream job at risk. As the holidays approach, Josie and Palmer must grapple with the complications that arise when dreams confront reality, and the Christmas magic that can happen when they put their faith in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie Macomber is at her best in this beautiful holiday story about the far journeys we travel to find a place to call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 4 hrs and 50 mins</description>

  <description>In this enchanting holiday novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nancy Thayer, family and friends gather on Nantucket for a gorgeous winter wedding with plenty of merry surprises in store.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As Christmas draws near, Felicia returns to her family’s home on the island to marry her adventurous, rugged boyfriend, Archie. Every detail is picture-perfect for a dream wedding: the snow-dusted streets, twinkling lights in the windows, a gorgeous red and white satin dress. Except a lavish ceremony is not Felicia’s dream at all; it’s what her mother, Jilly, wants. Jilly’s also worried that her daughter’s life with daredevil Archie will be all hiking and skydiving. Wondering if their handsome neighbor Steven Hardy might be a more suitable son-in-law, Jilly embarks on a secret matchmaking campaign for Felicia and the dashing stockbroker.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As the big day approaches and Jilly’s older daughter, Lauren, appears with rambunctious kids in tow, tensions in the household are high. With the family careening toward a Yuletide wedding disaster, an unexpected twist in Nancy Thayer’s heartwarming tale reminds everyone about the true meaning of the season.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Battle Cry of Freedom&lt;i&gt;, a powerful new reckoning with Jefferson Davis as military commander of the Confederacy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History has not been kind to Jefferson Davis. His cause went down in disastrous defeat and left the South impoverished for generations. If that cause had succeeded, it would have torn the United States in two and preserved the institution of slavery. Many Americans in Davis’s own time and in later generations considered him an incompetent leader, if not a traitor. Not so, argues James M. McPherson. In &lt;i&gt;Embattled Rebel&lt;/i&gt;, McPherson shows us that Davis might have been on the wrong side of history, but it is too easy to diminish him because of his cause’s failure. In order to understand the Civil War and its outcome, it is essential to give Davis his due as a military leader and as the president of an aspiring Confederate nation. Davis did not make it easy on himself. His subordinates and enemies alike considered him difficult, egotistical, and cold. He was gravely ill throughout much of the war, often working from home and even from his sickbed. Nonetheless, McPherson argues, Davis shaped and articulated the principal policy of the Confederacy with clarity and force: the quest for independent nationhood. Although he had not been a fire-breathing secessionist, once he committed himself to a Confederate nation he never deviated from this goal. In a sense, Davis was the last Confederate left standing in 1865. As president of the Confederacy, Davis devoted most of his waking hours to military strategy and operations, along with Commander Robert E. Lee, and delegated the economic and diplomatic functions of strategy to his subordinates. Davis was present on several battlefields with Lee and even took part in some tactical planning; indeed, their close relationship stands as one of the great military-civilian partnerships in history. Most critical appraisals of Davis emphasize his choices in and management of generals rather than his strategies, but no other chief executive in American history exercised such tenacious hands-on influence in the shaping of military strategy. And while he was imprisoned for two years after the Confederacy’s surrender awaiting a trial for treason that never came, and lived for another twenty-four years, he never once recanted the cause for which he had fought and lost. McPherson gives us Jefferson Davis as the commander in chief he really was, showing persuasively that while Davis did not win the war for the South, he was scarcely responsible for losing it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The touching prequel to the bestselling novel &lt;i&gt; A Dog Named Christmas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleeper hit of 2008, &lt;i&gt;A Dog Named Christmas&lt;/i&gt; became a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie a year later, seen by more than twelve million people in the United States alone. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Christmas with Tucker,&lt;/i&gt; Greg Kincaid brings back one of that book’s most endearing characters, sharing the moving story of George, a young boy dealing with the loss of his father, and the dog that comes into his life to offer him hope and a touch of courage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the winter of 1962, and Kansas is hit with one of the worst blizzards in its history. It is during this cruel season that twelve-year-old George is called upon to endure more than even most grown men could withstand—the death of his father and the upkeep of the family farm that is his legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother and sisters leave for Minnesota, George has only his grandparents and the companionship of Tucker, an Irish setter, to help him persevere through these most difficult challenges. Can he find the strength to walk the road that leads to healing, finding his true self and ultimately becoming a man? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coming-of-age story for readers of all ages, &lt;i&gt;Christmas with Tucker&lt;/i&gt; is a classic Christmas story about a young man’s love for his dog, his family, and his farm.</description>

  <description>On 10 June 1991, eleven-year-old Jaycee Dugard was abducted from a school bus stop within sight of her home in Tahoe, California. It was the last her family and friends saw of her for over eighteen years. On 26 August 2009, Dugard, her daughters, and Phillip Craig Garrido appeared in the office of her kidnapper's parole officer in California. Their unusual behaviour sparked an investigation that led to the positive identification of Jaycee Lee Dugard, living in a tent behind Garrido's home. During her time in captivity, at the age of fourteen and seventeen, she gave birth to two daughters, both fathered by Garrido. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dugard's memoir is written by the 30-year-old herself and covers the period from the time of her abduction in 1991 up until the present. In her stark, utterly honest and unflinching narrative, Jaycee opens up about what she experienced, including how she feels now, a year after being found. Garrido and his wife Nancy have since pleaded guilty to their crimes.</description>

  <description>Todd McCray, hero of A Dog Named Christmas, is now twenty-four years old and working at a local animal shelter, where he meets and quickly becomes best friends with Laura, a young volunteer. Laura, like Todd, has disabilities of her own, but her struggles are more physical than developmental. Their friendship is sealed when Todd -- with the help of his trusted companion, the tenacious Labrador retriever named Christmas -- trains a beautiful dog named Gracie to help Laura with the day-to-day life tasks that are difficult for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life seems good for Todd, but all is not well in his hometown. Struggling families unable to make ends meet are abandoning more and more dogs, and the shelter is swelling to capacity. The local government is struggling to meet its obligations too, and in early December, on the cusp of another holiday season, Todd’s boss delivers the bad news. Due to funding problems, the shelter will close its doors before the end of the year. But what will happen to all the animals? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Christmas holiday approaches, Todd has limited time to find homes for all the dogs. Not to mention that he needs to secure a new job and figure out what to do when his friendship with Laura takes an unexpected romantic turn. All this seems overwhelming unless you’ve got a loving family, dedicated friends, and a couple of very special dogs behind you. In which case, nothing is impossible.</description>

  <description>From the author of the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize-winning #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, a "dazzling" (Azar Nafisi, author of &lt;i&gt;Reading Lolita in Tehran&lt;/i&gt;) memoir about art and adventures in Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Doerr has received many awards—from the New York Public Library, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the American Library Association. Then came the Rome Prize, one of the most prestigious awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and with it a stipend and a writing studio in Rome for a year. Doerr learned of the award the day he and his wife returned from the hospital with newborn twins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exquisitely observed, Four Seasons in Rome describes Doerr's varied adventures in one of the most enchanting cities in the world. He reads Pliny, Dante, and Keats -- the chroniclers of Rome who came before him—and visits the piazzas, temples, and ancient cisterns they describe. He attends the vigil of a dying Pope John Paul II and takes his twins to the Pantheon in December to wait for snow to fall through the oculus. He and his family are embraced by the butchers, grocers, and bakers of the neighborhood, whose clamor of stories and idiosyncratic child-rearing advice is as compelling as the city itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This intimate and revelatory book is a celebration of Rome, a wondrous look at new parenthood, and a fascinating story of a writer's craft—the process by which he transforms what he sees and experiences into sentences.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Karen Kingsbury comes A Baxter Family Christmas, the first in a new series, combining the charm and holiday ambiance of The Bridge with the familiar members of fan-favorite family, the Baxters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two sorrowful years have passed since the terrible car accident that took the life of John Baxter's daughter, Erin, along with her husband and three of their four daughters. But this year John has invited a stranger for dinner - Kendra Bryant, the transplant recipient who now has Erin's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In light of her father's idea, Ashley and her brother Luke don't think it's right. They want to protect their ten-year-old niece, Amy - the only surviving member of the accident. But John is determined and believes meeting this woman is something his deceased daughter would want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, Maddie West, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Brooke Baxter West, is praying for meaning this Christmas. Could she find it in a newfound friendship with a boy she never expected to see again? Maddie believes in miracles, especially at Christmastime, but this is a stretch even she can't imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kendra Bryant has been struggling these past few years to find meaning in the tragedy that gave her a second chance. She believes this invitation to see the Baxters and witness their unwavering faith in God can instill hope and happiness back into her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartwarming and touching, filled with love and hope, A Baxter Family Christmas brings together two families in the aftermath of a tragedy and in the midst of an unfolding love story, all with the help of one very special child.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Orchid Thief&lt;/i&gt;, a compelling narrative set within the strange and genteel world of rare-book collecting: the true story of an infamous book thief, his victims, and the man determined to catch him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rare-book theft is even more widespread than fine-art theft. Most thieves, of course, steal for profit. John Charles Gilkey steals purely for the love of books. In an attempt to understand him better, journalist Allison Hoover Bartlett plunged herself into the world of book lust and discovered just how dangerous it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilkey is an obsessed, unrepentant book thief who has stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books from book fairs, stores, and libraries around the country. Ken Sanders is the self-appointed "bibliodick" (book dealer with a penchant for detective work) driven to catch him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bartlett befriended both outlandish characters and found herself caught in the middle of efforts to recover hidden treasure. With a mixture of suspense, insight, and humor, she has woven this entertaining cat-and-mouse chase into a narrative that not only reveals exactly how Gilkey pulled off his dirtiest crimes, where he stashed the loot, and how Sanders ultimately caught him but also explores the romance of books, the lure to collect them, and the temptation to steal them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immersing the reader in a rich, wide world of literary obsession, Bartlett looks at the history of book passion, collection, and theft through the ages, to examine the craving that makes some people willing to stop at nothing to possess the books they love.</description>

  <description>Strength in What Remains is a wonderfully written, inspiring account of one man’s remarkable American journey and of the ordinary people who helped him – a brilliant testament to the power of will and of second chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracy Kidder, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and author of the bestsellers The Soul of a New Machine, House, and the enduring classic Mountains Beyond Mountains, has been described by the Baltimore Sun as the “master of the non-fiction narrative.” In this new book, Kidder gives us the superb story of a hero for our time. Strength in What Remains is a wonderfully written, inspiring account of one man’s remarkable American journey and of the ordinary people who helped him – a brilliant testament to the power of will and of second chances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deo arrives in America from Burundi in search of a new life. Having survived a civil war and genocide, plagued by horrific dreams, he lands at JFK airport with two hundred dollars, no English, and no contacts. He ekes out a precarious existence delivering groceries, living in Central Park, and learning English by reading dictionaries in bookstores. Then Deo begins to meet the strangers who will change his life, pointing him eventually in the direction of Columbia University, medical school, and a life devoted to healing. Kidder breaks new ground in telling this unforgettable story as he travels with Deo back over a turbulent life in search of meaning and forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extraordinary writer, Tracy Kidder once again shows us what it means to be fully human by telling a story about the heroism inherent in ordinary people, a story about a life based on hope.</description>

  <description>This book is Palmer’s parting gift to the world―a treasure trove of entertaining anecdotes and timeless wisdom that readers, golfers and non-golfers alike, will celebrate and cherish. No one has won more fans around the world and no player has had a bigger impact on the sport of golf than Arnold Palmer. In fact, Palmer is considered by many to be the most important professional golfer in history, an American icon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In A Life Well Played, Palmer takes stock of the many experiences of his life, bringing new details and insights to some familiar stories and sharing new ones. This book is for Arnie's Army and all golf fans but it is more than just a golf book; Palmer had tremendous success off the course as well and is most notable for his exemplary sportsmanship and business success, while always giving back to the fans who made it all possible. Gracious, fair, and a true gentleman, "Arnie" was the gold standard of how to conduct yourself in your career, life, and relationships. Perfect for men and women of all ages, his final book offers advice and guidance, sharing personal stories of his career on the course, success in business, and the great relationships that gave meaning to his life.</description>

  <description>9 hours, 12 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, ten years after her abduction from her Salt Lake City bedroom, Elizabeth Smart reveals how she survived and the secret to forging a new life in the wake of a brutal crime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 5, 2002, fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, the daughter of a close-knit Mormon family, was taken from her home in the middle of the night by religious fanatic, Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She was kept chained, dressed in disguise, repeatedly raped, and told she and her family would be killed if she tried to escape. After her rescue on March 12, 2003, she rejoined her family and worked to pick up the pieces of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the first time, in her memoir, MY STORY, she tells of the constant fear she endured every hour, her courageous determination to maintain hope, and how she devised a plan to manipulate her captors and convinced them to return to Utah, where she was rescued minutes after arriving. Smart explains how her faith helped her stay sane in the midst of a nightmare and how she found the strength to confront her captors at their trial and see that justice was served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the nine years after her rescue, Smart transformed from victim to advocate, traveling the country and working to educate, inspire and foster change. She has created a foundation to help prevent crimes against children and is a frequent public speaker. In 2012, she married Matthew Gilmour, whom she met doing mission work in Paris for her church, in a fairy tale wedding that made the cover of &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; magazine.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sweeping narrative history of a terrifying serial killer--America's first--who stalked Austin, Texas in 1885&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1800s, the city of Austin, Texas was on the cusp of emerging from an isolated western outpost into a truly cosmopolitan metropolis. But beginning in December 1884, Austin was terrorized by someone equally as vicious and, in some ways, far more diabolical than London's infamous Jack the Ripper. For almost exactly one year, the Midnight Assassin crisscrossed the entire city, striking on moonlit nights, using axes, knives, and long steel rods to rip apart women from every race and class. At the time the concept of a serial killer was unthinkable, but the murders continued, the killer became more brazen, and the citizens' panic reached a fever pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before it was all over, at least a dozen men would be arrested in connection with the murders, and the crimes would expose what a newspaper described as "the most extensive and profound scandal ever known in Austin." And yes, when Jack the Ripper began his attacks in 1888, London police investigators did wonder if the killer from Austin had crossed the ocean to terrorize their own city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With vivid historical detail and novelistic flair, &lt;i&gt;Texas Monthly&lt;/i&gt; journalist Skip Hollandsworth brings this terrifying saga to life.</description>

  <description>The true story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock-therapy machine could provide entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running with Scissors is the true story of a boy whose mother (a poet with delusions of Anne Sexton) gave him away to be raised by her unorthodox psychiatrist who bore a striking resemblance to Santa Claus. So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctor’s bizarre family, and befriending a pedophile who resided in the backyard shed. The story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, and the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, where Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock- therapy machine could provide entertainment. The funny, harrowing and bestselling account of an ordinary boy’s survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thrilling new adventure of danger and deep-sea diving, historic mystery and suspense, by the author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Shadow Divers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finding and identifying a pirate ship is the hardest thing to do under the sea. But two men—John Chatterton and John Mattera—are willing to risk everything to find the &lt;i&gt;Golden Fleece,&lt;/i&gt; the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. At large during the Golden Age of Piracy in the seventeenth century, Bannister’s exploits would have been more notorious than Blackbeard’s, more daring than Kidd’s, but his story, and his ship, have been lost to time. If Chatterton and Mattera succeed, they will make history—it will be just the second time ever that a pirate ship has been discovered and positively identified. Soon, however, they realize that cutting-edge technology and a willingness to lose everything aren’t enough to track down Bannister’s ship. They must travel the globe in search of historic documents and accounts of the great pirate’s exploits, face down dangerous rivals, battle the tides of nations and governments and experts. But it’s only when they learn to think and act like pirates—like Bannister—that they become able to go where no pirate hunters have gone before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fast-paced and filled with suspense, fascinating characters, history, and adventure, &lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable story that goes deep to discover truths and souls long believed lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A great thriller full of tough guys and long odds . . . and: It’s all true.”&lt;b&gt;—Lee Child&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Action and adventure on land and sea—you can’t ask for more. But Robert Kurson raises the ante in &lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt; with an array of mystery and a fleet of colorful characters spanning four centuries. This is a great summer read!”&lt;b&gt;—Michael Connelly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “&lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt; is a fantastic book, an utterly engrossing and satisfying read. It tells the story of the hunt for the rare wreck of a pirate ship, which had been captained by one of the most remarkable pirates in history. This is a real-life &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island,&lt;/i&gt; complete with swashbuckling, half-crazy treasure hunters and vivid Caribbean settings—a story for the ages.”&lt;b&gt;—Douglas Preston&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “A terrific read. I was pulled in from page one. Kurson brings us face to face with some of the most swashbuckling pirates ever to sail the Caribbean, even as he takes us underwater on a high-tech quest to discover the relics they left behind.”&lt;b&gt;—Daniel James Brown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “There’s nothing in the world like buried treasure—and people hungry and obsessed enough to risk their lives for it. &lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt; isn’t just a good story—it’s a true one. Searching for the souls of its explorers, it takes you to the far tip of the plank and plunges you deep to the bottom of the ocean.”&lt;b&gt;—Brad Meltzer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “&lt;i&gt;Pirate Hunters&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping account of two courageous divers’ quest to uncover the shipwrecked vessel of Joseph Bannister, one of history’s most infamous pirates. Robert Kurson will keep you on the edge of your seat in this high-stakes journey around the globe that ultimately teaches these explorers about much more than an old ship.”&lt;b&gt;—Sen. John McCain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “Kurson’s own enthusiasm, combined with his copious research and an eye for detail, makes for one of the most mind-blowing pirate stories of recent memory.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An intimate book of inspiration by one of the great cultural icons of our time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Higher Is Waiting&lt;/i&gt; is a spiritual guidebook, a collection of teachings culled from the experiences of a lifetime, meant to inspire readers to climb higher in their own lives and pull themselves up to a better, more fulfilling place. In this gem of a book, Tyler Perry writes of how his faith has sustained him in hard times, centered him in good times, and enriched his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with his earliest memories of growing up a shy boy in New Orleans, Perry recalls the moments of grace and beauty in a childhood marked by brutality, deprivation, and fear. With tenderness he sketches portraits of the people who sustained him and taught him indelible lessons about integrity, trust in God, and the power of forgiveness: his aunt Mae, who cared for her grandfather, who was born a slave, and sewed quilts that told a story of generations; of Mr. Butler, a blind man of remarkable dignity and elegance, who sold penny candies on a street corner; and his beloved mother, Maxine, who endured abuse, financial hardship, and the daily injustices of growing up in the Jim Crow South yet whose fierce love for her son burned bright and never dimmed. Perry writes of how he nurtured his dreams and discovered solace in nature, and of his resolute determination to reach ever higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perry vividly and movingly describes his growing awareness of God's presence in his life, how he learned to tune in to His voice, to persevere through hard times, and to choose faith over fear. Here he is: the devoted son, the loving father, the steadfast friend, the naturalist, the philanthropist, the creative spirit--a man whose life lessons and insights into Scripture are a gift offered with generosity, humility, and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Long before the specter of terrorism haunted the public imagination, a serial bomber stalked the streets of 1950s New York. The race to catch him would give birth to a new science called criminal profiling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand Central, Penn Station, Radio City Music Hall for almost two decades, no place was safe from the man who signed his anonymous letters FP and left his lethal devices in phone booths, storage lockers, even tucked into the plush seats of movie theaters. His victims were left cruelly maimed. Tabloids called him the greatest individual menace New York City ever faced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, Police Captain Howard Finney sought the help of a little known psychiatrist, Dr. James Brussel, whose expertise was the criminal mind. Examining crime scene evidence and the strange wording in the bomber s letters, he compiled a portrait of the suspect down to the cut of his jacket. But how to put a name to the description? Seymour Berkson a handsome New York socialite, protege of William Randolph Hearst, and publisher of the tabloid &lt;i&gt;The Journal-American&lt;/i&gt; joined in pursuit of the Mad Bomber. The three men hatched a brilliant scheme to catch him at his own game. Together, they would capture a monster and change the face of American law enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1913, under the cover of London’s perpetual smoggy dusk, two brilliant minds are pitted against each other—a celebrated gentleman thief and a talented Scotland Yard detective—in the greatest jewel heist of the new century. An exquisite strand of pale pink pearls, worth more than the Hope Diamond, has been bought by a Hatton Garden broker. Word of the “Mona Lisa of Pearls” spreads around the world, captivating jewelers as well as thieves. In transit to London from Paris, the necklace vanishes without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Grizzard, “the King of Fences,” is the charming leader of a vast gang of thieves in London’s East End. Grizzard grew up on the streets of Whitechapel during the terror of Jack the Ripper to rise to the top of the criminal world. Wealthy, married, and a father, Grizzard still cannot resist the sport of crime, and the pearl necklace proves an irresistible challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspector Alfred Ward patrols the city’s dark, befogged streets before joining the brand-new division of the Metropolitan Police known as “detectives.” Ward earns his stripes catching some of the great murderers of Victorian London and, at the height of his career, is asked to turn his forensic talents to finding the missing pearls and the thief who stole them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of &lt;i&gt;The Great Train Robbery&lt;/i&gt; and the tales of Sherlock Holmes, this is the true story of a psychological cat-and-mouse game set against the backdrop of London’s golden Edwardian era. Thoroughly researched, compellingly colorful, &lt;i&gt;The Great Pearl Heist&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping narrative account of this little-known, yet extraordinary crime.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Richard Paul Evans, the next exciting holiday-themed novel in his &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Noel Collection&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Walther feels like her world is imploding. Publicly humiliated after her husband, a local councilman, is arrested for bigamy, and her subsequent divorce, she has isolated herself from the world. When her only friend insists that Maggie climb out of her hole, and embrace the season to get her out of her funk, Maggie decides to put up a Christmas tree and heads off to buy one — albeit reluctantly. She is immediately taken by Andrew, the kind, handsome man who owns the Christmas tree lot and delivers her tree. She soon learns that Andrew is single and new to her city and, like her, is also starting his life anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As their friendship develops, Maggie slowly begins to trust again — something she never thought possible. Then, just when she thinks she has finally found happiness, she discovers a dark secret from Andrew’s past. Is there more to this stranger’s truth than meets the eye? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This powerful new holiday novel from Richard Paul Evans explores the true power of the season, redemption, and the freedom that comes from forgiveness.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second novel in the bestselling trilogy from Richard Paul Evans about a man on an inspirational pilgrimage across Route 66 to find his way back to himself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicago celebrity and successful pitchman Charles James is supposed to be dead. Everyone believes he was killed in a fiery plane crash. But thanks to a remarkable twist of fate, he’s very much alive and ready for a second chance at life—and love. Narrowly escaping death has brought Charles some clarity: the money, the fame, the fast cars—none of it was making him happy. The last time he was happy—&lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; happy—was when he was married to his ex-wife Monica, before their connection was destroyed by his ambition and greed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Charles decides to embark on an epic quest: He will walk the entire length of Route 66, from Chicago to California, where he hopes to convince Monica to give him another shot. Along the way, Charles is immersed in the deep and rich history of one of America’s most iconic highways. But the greater journey he finds is the one he takes in his heart as he meets people along the road who will change his perspective on the world. But will his transformation be enough to earn redemption?</description>

  <description>As he is driving home from a minister's conference, Baptist minister Don Piper collides with a semi-truck that crosses into his lane. He is pronounced dead at the scene. For the next 90 minutes, Piper experiences heaven where he is greeted by those who had influenced him spiritually. He hears beautiful music and feels true peace. &lt;br /&gt;Back on earth, a passing minister who had also been at the conference is led to pray for Don even though he knows the man is dead. Piper miraculously comes back to life and the bliss of heaven is replaced by a long and painful recovery. &lt;br /&gt;For years Piper kept his heavenly experience to himself. Finally, however, friends and family convinced him to share his remarkable story.</description>

  <description>In this gripping narrative history, the beloved NBC weather personality vividly brings to life the Great Gulf Hurricane of 1900, the deadliest natural disaster in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the afternoon of September 8, 1900, 200-mile-per-hour winds and fifteen-foot waves slammed into Galveston, the prosperous and growing port city on Texas’s Gulf Coast. By dawn the next day, when the storm had passed, the city that existed just hours before was gone. Shattered, grief-stricken survivors emerged to witness a level of destruction never before seen: 8,000 corpses littered the streets and were buried under the massive wreckage. Rushing water had lifted buildings from their foundations, smashing them into pieces, while intensive winds had upended girders and trestles, driving them through house walls and into sidewalks. In less than twenty-four hours, one storm destroyed a major American metropolis—and awakened a nation to the terrifying power of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Storm of the Century&lt;/em&gt; brings this legendary disaster and its aftermath into brilliant focus. No other natural disaster has ever matched the havoc caused by the awesome mix of winds, rains, and flooding that devastated this bustling metropolis and shocked a young, optimistic nation on the cusp of modernity. Exploring the impact of the disaster on a rising nation’s confidence—the pain and trauma of the loss and the determination of the response—Al Roker illuminates both the energy and the limitations of the American Century, and of nature itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There is more to the Bible than we ever imagined...messages from God--both hopeful and troubling--hidden for ages, now revealed by modern computer technology. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chamberlain Key&lt;/i&gt;tells how Timothy Smith, an appraiser and conservator of artifacts and antiquities, discovered and decoded a complex message in an ancient Hebrew manuscript of the Bible--a message that applied startlingly and unmistakably to&lt;i&gt;him!&lt;/i&gt;The book relates the painstaking process Smith undertook to verify and authenticate this "contact"--a quest filled with adventure and mystery. But instead of using old maps to find buried treasure, this hunt uses the data calculation power of modern technology. The author's remarkable discovery shows how the Bible is even more amazing than we ever dreamed... layered with meaning and insight, a book like no other, prepared by a brilliant Creator who wants to explain his loving plans, as well as issue serious warnings that may apply to the generations alive today."</description>

  <description>The author of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;Proof of Heaven&lt;/i&gt; teams up with the sages of times past, modern scientists, and with ordinary people who have had profound spiritual experiences to show the reality of heaven and our true identities as spiritual beings. &lt;i&gt;The Map of Heaven&lt;/i&gt; takes the broad view to reveal how modern science is on the verge of the most profound revolution in recorded history—all around the phenomenon of consciousness itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dr. Eben Alexander told the story of his near-death experience and his vivid journey to the other side, many readers wrote to say it resonated with them profoundly. Thanks to them, Dr. Alexander realized that sharing his story allowed people to rediscover what so many in ancient times knew: there is more to life, and the to the universe, than this single earthly life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Alexander and his co-author Ptolemy Tompkins were surprised to see how often his readers’ visions of the afterlife synced up with each other and with those of the world’s spiritual leaders, as well as its philosophers and scientists. In &lt;i&gt;The Map of Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, he shares the stories people have told him and shows how they are echoed both in the world’s faiths and in its latest scientific insights. It turns out there is much agreement, across time and terrain, about the journey of the soul and its survival beyond death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Dr. Alexander makes the case for heaven as a genuine place, showing how we have forgotten, but are now at last remembering, who we really are and what our destiny truly is.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Expected One&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Book of Love&lt;/i&gt; comes a transformative book that unlocks the hidden power of the Lord's Prayer -- the prayer that can be recited by every Christian in the world.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;real secret&lt;/i&gt; to creating and sustaining an abundant, joyous, and fulfilled life has been hiding in plain sight -- in the power of the prayer that unites two billion Christians worldwide, the prayer that each one of them knows by heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True happiness and success can't just be wished for. The real secret to fulfillment lies in using the Lord's Prayer as part of an ongoing spiritual practice that leads to real and lasting change in the soul -- change that will manifest itself in earthly, tangible ways. Each chapter in &lt;i&gt;The Source of Miracles&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to one of seven steps in that process, corresponding to a primary teaching of the prayer: faith, surrender, service, abundance, forgiveness, obstacles, and love. Each chapter also includes meditations, affirmations, and other activities designed to help readers work through life's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her bestselling fiction, Kathleen McGowan has popularized the world of Christian esoterica, a unique place where New Age and Christianity meet, making ancient teachings new and powerful.&lt;i&gt; The Source of Miracles&lt;/i&gt; harnesses the wisdom of those traditions at a time of great material and spiritual uncertainty, when the need for signposts on the road to success has never been more acute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Wendy Harper inherits her family's beachside cottage in Seaside, Maine, she sees it as a way to finally pay off the debts that have mounted since her husband died. But before it can be sold, the neglected property must be renovated. She and her 12-year-old son Jackson move in--temporarily, she reminds him--in order to do the work themselves, even though Christmas is coming. The charming town, along with local craftsman Caleb Colton, pulls on both Wendy and Jackson, who even registers himself for school in a bid to get his mom to move them there permanently. Wendy knows that the most responsible thing to do is to sell the cottage and return to Ohio, but the lure of the sea is hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join award-winning author Melody Carlson for a Christmas story that will warm your heart and have you dreaming of your own enchanted seaside holiday.</description>

  <description>When a health scare puts him in the hospital, Eric Weiner-an agnostic by default-finds himself tangling with an unexpected question, posed to him by a well-meaning nurse. "Have you found your God yet?" The thought of it nags him, and prods him-and ultimately launches him on a far-flung journey to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weiner, a longtime "spiritual voyeur" and inveterate traveler, realizes that while he has been privy to a wide range of religious practices, he's never seriously considered these concepts in his own life. Face to face with his own mortality, and spurred on by the question of what spiritual principles to impart to his young daughter, he decides to correct this omission, undertaking a worldwide exploration of religions and hoping to come, if he can, to a personal understanding of the divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey that results is rich in insight, humor, and heart. Willing to do anything to better understand faith, and to find the god or gods that speak to him, he travels to Nepal, where he meditates with Tibetan lamas and a guy named Wayne. He sojourns to Turkey, where he whirls (not so well, as it turns out) with Sufi dervishes. He heads to China, where he attempts to unblock his chi; to Israel, where he studies Kabbalah, sans Madonna; and to Las Vegas, where he has a close encounter with Raelians (followers of the world's largest UFO-based religion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At each stop along the way, Weiner tackles our most pressing spiritual questions: Where do we come from? What happens when we die? How should we live our lives? Where do all the missing socks go? With his trademark wit and warmth, he leaves no stone unturned. At a time when more Americans than ever are choosing a new faith, and when spiritual questions loom large in the modern age, MAN SEEKS GOD presents a perspective on religion that is sure to delight, inspire, and entertain.</description>

      <![CDATA[Was an interesting read on the different religions that Eric Weiner researched for this book. As for the title, misleading. The subtitle nailed it. I got the feeling that the only reason Eric flirted with the Divine was to write another book. I never got the feeling he was actually looking for Go...]]>

  <description>On the evening of March 17, 1959, as the people of Tibet braced for a violent power grab by Chinese occupiers—one that would forever wipe out any vestige of national sovereignty—the twenty-four-year-old Dalai Lama, Tibet’s political and spiritual leader, contemplated the impossible. The task before him was immense: to slip past a cordon of crack Chinese troops ringing his summer palace and, with an escort of 300, journey across the highest terrain in the world and over treacherous Himalayan passes to freedom—one step ahead of pursuing Chinese soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mao Zedung, China’s ruthless Communist dictator, had pinned his hopes for total Tibetan submission on controlling the impressionable Dalai Lama. So beloved was the young ruler—so identified with his country’s essence—that for him to escape might mean perpetual resistance from a population unwilling to tolerate an increasingly brutal occupation. The Dalai Lama’s minders sent word to the Tibetan rebels and CIA-trained guerrillas who waited on the route:&lt;i&gt; His Holiness must escape&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;i&gt;at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was unprepared for the epic journey awaiting him. Twenty-two years earlier, government search parties, guided by prophecies and omens, had arrived at the boy’s humble peasant home and subjected the two-year-old to a series of tests. After being declared the reincarnation of Tibet’s previous ruler, the boy was brought to Lhasa to learn the secrets of Buddhism and the ways of ultimate power. Forced in the ensuing two decades to cope with aching loneliness and often stifling ritual—and compelled to suppress his mischievous personality—Gyatso eventually proved himself a capable leader. But no previous Dalai Lama had ever taken on a million Communist Chinese soldiers bent on stamping out Tibetan freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep his country’s dream of independence alive by means of a government in exile, the young ruler would not only have to brave battalions of enemy soldiers and the whiteout conditions waiting on the slopes of the Himalayas’ highest peaks, he’d have to overcome a different type of blindness: the naïveté intrinsic to his sheltered palace life and his position as leader of a people who considered violence deeply taboo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mind made up, the young Dalai Lama set off on his audacious journey to India while behind him a Chinese army rolled over Lhasa, its advance hunter patrols in fierce pursuit of the man they most coveted. The 14th’s escape was an act of daring and defiance that represented Tibet’s last hope, and so the world watched, transfixed, as the gentle monk’s journey unfolded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotionally powerful and irresistibly page-turning, &lt;i&gt;Escape from the Land of Snows&lt;/i&gt; is simultaneously a portrait of the inhabitants of a spiritual nation forced to take up arms in defense of their ideals, and the saga of an initially childlike ruler who at first wore his monk’s robes uncomfortably but was ultimately transformed by his escape into the towering figure the world knows today—a charismatic champion of free thinking and universal compassion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>How should an atheist respond to a sneeze? In an argument, how do you kick ass when you don't have a leg to stand on? After years of exploring the small pockets in life's backpack in his celebrated weekend &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; 'How to...' column, Guy Browning has become the authority on such matters. The runaway #1 British Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Never Hit a Jellyfish with a Spade&lt;/i&gt; offers intelligent, practical advice on the level you need it, the trivial level:&lt;br /&gt; o How to evaluate a bottle of wine (if the alcohol content is less than 15 percent, send it straight back)&lt;br /&gt; o How to get what you want at the barber's (no multipart instructions, please) &lt;br /&gt; o How to stay warm in bed (when your partner has cold feet and steals the covers) &lt;br /&gt; o How to be a fashionista (when your twenty-year-old wardrobe is suddenly back in vogue) &lt;br /&gt; o How to pretend to laugh at a friend's joke (the closest most men get to faking orgasm) &lt;br /&gt; o How to fix a computer (If restarting it doesn't work, turn it off and go back to a pre- industrial lifestyle.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Covering cooking and eating, sleeping and waking, men and women, love and marriage, religion and politics, hedges and neighbors, &lt;i&gt;Never Hit a Jellyfish with a Spade&lt;/i&gt; delivers the truth about the things that really matter. With a package as fun as its contents, it's the ideal gift for anyone who wants to live life with a sense of humor.</description>

  <description>Even before he was shot dead on the stairway of the tony Grand Central Hotel in 1872, financier James “Jubilee Jim” Fisk, Jr., was a notorious New York City figure. From his audacious attempt to corner the gold market in 1869 to his battle for control of the geographically crucial Erie Railroad, Fisk was a flamboyant exemplar of a new financial era marked by volatile fortunes and unprecedented greed and corruption. But it was his scandalously open affair with a showgirl named Josie Mansfield that ultimately led to his demise.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this riveting short history—the first in his American Portraits series—H. W. Brands traces Fisk’s extraordinary downfall, bringing to life New York’s Gilded Age and some of its legendary players, including Boss William Tweed, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and the railroad tycoon Jay Gould.</description>

  <description>A man receives the best Christmas present he could ask for: the chance to re-write the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Chercher is not doing well in love or life. Just two weeks after his wife leaves him he receives a phone call that his estranged mother has passed away, days before Christmas—leaving her home and all her belongings to him. Frankly, he would like to see everything just burned. But curiosity about his past and anxiety about his future fuels him to make the drive from Salt Lake City to her home in Medford, Oregon. Maybe cleaning out her house will be slightly less depressing than spending the holidays, alone, watching re-runs of Christmas classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While going through her things he comes upon her diary and the record of his childhood. He learns that his mother suffered from severe depression and during that difficult time he was taken care of by a young, unwed mother who was living with his family. The only clue he has to the woman’s identity is her name: Noel, which is an eerily fitting discovery on Christmas Eve. As Jason reads the diary he begins to uncover the source of his pain in relationships and understand that what he believed to be the truth of his past was actually a lie. That’s when he begins a journey to find Noel, wondering if she might hold the truth he needs to bring him peace and love.</description>

  <description>For out-starting upstarts of all ages, here is a wonderfully wise and blessedly brief graduation speech from the one and only Dr. Seuss. In his inimitable, humorous verse and pictures, he addresses the Great Balancing Act (life itself, and the ups and downs it presents) while encouraging us to find the success that lies within us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And will you succeed?&lt;br /&gt;Yes! You will indeed!&lt;br /&gt;(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A modern classic, &lt;i&gt;Oh, the Places You'll Go!&lt;/i&gt; was first published one year before Dr. Seuss's death at the age of eighty-seven. In a mere fifty-six pages, Dr, Seuss managed to impart a lifetime of wisdom. It is the perfect send-off for children starting out in the maze of life, be they nursery school grads or newly-minted PhD's. Everyone will find it inspired good fun.</description>

  <description>The award–winning creators of The New York Times best sellers What Do You Do With an Idea? and What Do You Do With a Problem? return with a captivating story about a child who isn't sure what to make of a chance encounter and then discovers that when you have courage, take chances, and say yes to new experiences, amazing things can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this story, a child is visited by his first chance and unsure what to do with it, he lets it go. Later on, when a new chance arrives he reaches for it, but this time he misses and falls. Embarrassed and afraid, he begins ignoring each new chance that comes by, even though he still wants to take them. Then one day he realizes that he doesn't need to be brave all the time, just at the right time, to find out what amazing things can happen when he takes a chance…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final addition to the award-winning What Do You Do With…? picture book series created by New York Times best selling author Kobi Yamada and illustrator by Mae Besom, What Do You Do With a Chance? inspires kids of all ages and parents alike to find the courage to go for the opportunities that come their way. Because you never know when a chance, once taken, might be the one to change everything.</description>

  <description>It's the twenty-first century and let's be honest-things are a little disappointing. Despite every World's Fair prediction and the advertisements in comic books, we are not living the future we were promised. By now, life was supposed to be a fully automated, atomic-powered, germ-free Utopia, a place where a grown man could wear a velvet spandex unitard and not be laughed at. Where are the ray guns, the flying cars, and the hoverboards that we expected? What happened to our moon colonies and servant robots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Where's My Jetpack? roboticist Daniel H. Wilson takes a hilarious look at the future we imagined for ourselves. You will learn which technologies are already available, who made them, and where to find them. If the technology is not public, you will learn how to build, buy, or steal it. And if doesn't yet exist, you will learn what stands in the way of making it real. With thirty entries spanning everything from teleportation to self-contained skyscraper cities, Where's My Jetpack? is an endlessly entertaining, one-of-a-kind look at the world that we always wanted.</description>

  <description>The #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Box&lt;/i&gt; and master of the holiday novel reimagines the biblical story of Joseph and the coat of many colors, presenting an inspiring modern story of family and forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Jacobson is the twelfth of thirteen siblings, all of whom are employed by their father’s successful Colorado advertising company. But underneath the success runs a poisonous undercurrent of jealousy; Joseph is his father’s favorite and the focus of his brothers’ envy and hatred. When the father seems ready to anoint Joseph as his heir, the brothers make their move, forcing Joseph from the company and his Denver home, severing his ties to his parents and ending his relationship with his soon-to-be fianceé. Alone and lonely, Joseph must start a new life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joseph joins a Chicago advertising agency where his creativity helps him advance high up in the company. He also finds hope for a lasting love with April, a kind woman with a secret. However, all secrets hold consequences, and when Joseph learns the truth about April’s past, his world is again turned upside down. Finally, Joseph must confront his own difficult past in order to make his dreams for the future come true.</description>

  <description>The second holiday love story in &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Richard Paul Evans’s Mistletoe Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-two Kimberly Rossi, a finance officer at a Lexus car dealership, has had her heart broken more times than she wants to remember. With two failed engagements, a divorce and again alone with no prospects, she hardly seems the type to dream of being a published romance author. Dreading another holiday alone, she signs up for The Mistletoe Retreat, a nine-day writing retreat in Burlington, VT. Deep inside Kimberly knows she’s at a junction in her life and it’s time to either fulfill her dream or let it go. The other reason she decides to attend the conference is because famed romance writer, H.T. Cowell, once the best selling romance writer in America, and the author whose books instilled in her the desire to be a writer, will be speaking in public for the first time in more than a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of her breakout sessions Kimberly meets another aspiring writer, and one of the few men at the conference, Zeke, an intelligent man with a wry wit who seems as interested in Kimberly as he is in the retreat. As Kimberly begins to open up to him about her stories and dreams, she inadvertently reveals her own troubled past. As Zeke helps her to discover why her books fail to live up to their potential she begins to wonder if he’s really talking more about her life than her literature. But as she grows closer to him, she realizes that Zeke has his own darkness, a past he’s unwilling to talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of &lt;i&gt;The Mistletoe Inn&lt;/i&gt; is that like literature, relationships must be lived with passion and vulnerability to succeed.</description>

  <description>From one of America’s most beloved storytellers comes his most spiritual book since The Christmas Box.&lt;br /&gt;“It has been said that sometimes the greatest hope in our lives is just a second chance to do what we should have done right in the first place. This is the story of my second chance.” —Prologue of Lost December&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Luke Crisp graduates from business school, his father, CEO and co-founder of Fortune 500 Crisp’s Copy Centers, is ready to share some good news: he wants to turn the family business over to his son. But Luke has other plans. Taking control of his trust fund, Luke leaves home to pursue a life of reckless indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his funds run out, so do his friends. Humbled, alone, and too ashamed to ask his father for help, Luke secretly takes a lowly job at one of his father’s copy centers. There he falls in love with a struggling single mother and begins to understand the greatest source of personal joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost December is Richard Paul Evans’s modernday holiday version of the biblical story of the prodigal son, a powerful tale of redemption, hope, and the true meaning of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning narrative account of the mysterious Jordanian who penetrated both the inner circle of al-Qaeda and the highest reaches of the CIA, with a devastating impact on the war on terror.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In December 2009, a group of the CIA’s top terrorist hunters gathered at a secret base in Khost, Afghanistan, to greet a rising superspy: Humam Khalil al-Balawi, a Jordanian double-agent who infiltrated the upper ranks of al-Qaeda. For months, he had sent shocking revelations from inside the terrorist network and now promised to help the CIA assassinate Osama bin Laden’s top deputy. Instead, as he stepped from his car, he detonated a thirty-pound bomb strapped to his chest, instantly killing seven CIA operatives, the agency’s worst loss of life in decades.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Triple Agent&lt;/i&gt;, Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter Joby Warrick takes us deep inside the CIA’s secret war against al-Qaeda, a war that pits robotic planes and laser-guided missiles against a cunning enemy intent on unleashing carnage in American cities. Flitting precariously between the two sides was Balawi, a young man with extraordinary gifts who managed to win the confidence of hardened terrorists as well as veteran spymasters. With his breathtaking accounts from inside al-Qaeda’s lair, Balawi appeared poised to become America’s greatest double-agent in half a century—but he was not at all what he seemed. Combining the powerful momentum of &lt;i&gt;Black Hawk Down&lt;/i&gt; with the institutional insight of Jane Mayer’s &lt;i&gt;The Dark Side&lt;/i&gt;, Warrick takes the readers on a harrowing journey from the slums of Amman to the inner chambers of the White House in an untold true story of miscalculation, deception, and revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;There is no hurt so great that love cannot heal it. &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Nathan Hurst hated Christmas. For the rest of the world it was a day of joy and celebration; for Nathan it was simply a reminder of the event that destroyed his childhood until a snowstorm, a cancelled flight and an unexpected meeting with a young mother and her very special son would show him that Christmas is indeed the season of miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Christmas season is supposed to be full of joy, but not for Mark Smart. Life had dealt him one blow after another until one snowy November night, when he finds a beautiful young woman who will change his life forever. Macy Wood has little memory of her birth parents, and memories she'd rather forget of her adopted home. A Christmas ornament inscribed with the word "Noel" is the only clue to the little sister she only vaguely remembers, a clue that will send her and Mark on a journey to reclaim her past, and her family.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>Mike Leonard is a lucky man. It’s not everyone who gets parents like Jack and Marge. At eighty-seven, Jack is a pathological optimist with an inexhaustible gift of gab. Marge, Jack’s bride of sixty years, though cut from the same rough bolt of Irish immigrant cloth, is his polar opposite–pessimistic and proud of it. What was their son, Mike, thinking when he took a sabbatical from his job with NBC News so he could pile these two world-class originals along with three of his grown kids and a daughter-in-law into a pair of rented RVs and hit the road for a month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike was thinking that he wanted to give his parents the ultimate family reunion. And so, one February morning, three generations of Leonards set out on their journey under the dazzling Arizona sky. Thirty minutes later, one of the humongous recreational vehicles has an unplanned meeting with a concrete island at a convenience store. Thus begins the adventure of a lifetime–and an absolute gem of a book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the course of their humorous, often poignant cross-country tour, from the desert Southwest to the New England coastline, the Leonards reminisce about their loves, their losses, and their rich and heartwarming (and sometimes heartbreaking) lives, while encountering a veritable Greek chorus of roadside characters along the way. The home stretch finds the clan racing back to Chicago, hoping to catch the arrival of the next generation, Jack and Marge’s first great-grandchild. Through it all, Mike pieces together acentury of family lore and lunacy–and discovers surprising sides to his parents that allow him to see them in a whole new light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Leonard has captivated millions of television viewers with his wry and witty feature stories for NBC’s Today. Now he brings that same engaging charm and keen insight to the foibles and passions of his own blessedly unique family. By turns uproariously funny and deeply moving, The Ride of Our Lives delivers a lifetime of laughs, lessons, and priceless memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Kirk Douglas has been one of the brightest stars in Hollywood, a hard-charging actor whose intensity on the screen has been mirrored in his personal life. In this poignant and inspiring memoir, Douglas contemplates what life is all about, weighing current events from his present frame of mind while summoning the passions of his younger days. Kirk Douglas is a born storyteller, and throughout Let's Face It he offers wonderful tales, favorite jokes, and hard-won insights. He explores the mixed blessings of growing older and looks back at his childhood, his young adulthood, and his storied, glamorous, and colorful life and career in Hollywood. He tells delightful stories of the making of such films as Spartacus, Lust for Life, Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful, and many others, and he includes anecdotes about such friends as Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall, Ronald Reagan, Ava Gardner, Henry Kissinger, Fred Astaire, Yul Brynner, John Wayne, and Johnny Cash. He reveals the secrets that have kept him and his wife, Anne, happily married for more than five decades and talks fondly and movingly of times spent with his sons and grandchildren. He also reflects upon his Jewish faith and offers strong opinions on everything from racism to corporate greed to the war in Iraq and the situation in Israel. A must-read for every fan, this engrossing memoir provides an indelible self-portrait of one of America's screen icons--while sharing the wit and wisdom Kirk Douglas has accumulated over a lifetime.</description>

  <description>Dr. Jan Pol is not your typical veterinarian. Born and raised the in Netherlands on a dairy farm, he is the star of Nat Geo Wild s hit show "The Incredible Dr. Pol" and has been treating animals in rural Michigan since the 1970s. Dr. Pol s more than 20,000 patients have ranged from white mice to 2600-pound horses and everything in between. &lt;br /&gt; From the time he was twelve years old and helped deliver a litter of piglets on his family s farm to the incredible moments captured on his hit TV show, Dr. Pol has amassed a wealth of stories of what it s like caring for this menagerie of animals. He has established himself as an empathetic yet no-nonsense vet who isn t afraid to make the difficult decisions in order to do what s best for his patients--and their hard-working owners. &lt;br /&gt; Reminiscent of the classic books of James Herriot, "Never Turn Your Back on an Angus Cow" is a charming, fascinating, and funny memoir that will delight animal lovers everywhere."</description>

  <description>Hidden amongst the photographs, uniforms, revolvers, and war medals of the Civil War are the remarkable stories of some of the most unlikely heroes-women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North, South, black, white, Native American, immigrant-the women in these micro-drama biographies are wives, mothers, sisters, and friends whose purposes ranged from supporting husbands and sons during wartime to counseling President Lincoln on strategy, from tending to the wounded on the battlefield to spiriting away slaves through the Underground Railroad, from donning a uniform and fighting unrecognized alongside the men to working as spies for either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book brings to light the incredible stories of women from the Civil War that remain relevant to our nation today. Each woman's experience helps us see a truer, fuller, richer version of what really happened in this country during this time period.</description>

  <description>In this irresistible memoir, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and winner of the Pulitzer Prize Anna Quindlen writes about looking back and ahead—and celebrating it all—as she considers marriage, girlfriends, our mothers, faith, loss, all the stuff in our closets, and more.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As she did in her beloved &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; columns, and in &lt;i&gt;A Short Guide to a Happy Life,&lt;/i&gt; Quindlen says for us here what we may wish we could have said ourselves. Using her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages, Quindlen talks about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marriage: &lt;/b&gt;“A safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn’t believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Girlfriends:&lt;/b&gt; “Ask any woman how she makes it through the day, and she may mention her calendar, her to-do lists, her babysitter. But if you push her on how she really makes it through her day, she will mention her girlfriends. Sometimes I will see a photo of an actress in an unflattering dress or a blouse too young for her or with a heavy-handed makeup job, and I mutter, ‘She must not have any girlfriends.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stuff:&lt;/b&gt; “Here’s what it comes down to, really: there is now so much stuff in my head, so many years, so many memories, that it’s taken the place of primacy away from the things in the bedrooms, on the porch. My doctor says that, contrary to conventional wisdom, she doesn’t believe our memories flag because of a drop in estrogen but because of how crowded it is in the drawers of our minds. Between the stuff at work and the stuff at home, the appointments and the news and the gossip and the rest, the past and the present and the plans for the future, the filing cabinets in our heads are not only full, they’re overflowing.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our bodies:&lt;/b&gt; “I’ve finally recognized my body for what it is: a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come. It’s like a car, and while I like a red convertible or even a Bentley as well as the next person, what I really need are four tires and an engine.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parenting:&lt;/b&gt; “Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward endeavor: We are good parents not so they will be loving enough to stay with us but so they will be strong enough to leave us.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; From childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, Quindlen uses the events of her own life to illuminate our own. Along with the downsides of age, she says, can come wisdom, a perspective on life that makes it satisfying and even joyful. Candid, funny, moving, &lt;i&gt;Lots&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of Candles, Plenty of Cake&lt;/i&gt; is filled with the sharp insights and revealing observations that have long confirmed Quindlen’s status as America’s laureate of real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In this irresistible memoir, the #1 New York Times bestselling author writes about her life and the lives of women today, looking back and ahead - and celebrating it all - as she considers marriage, girlfriends, our mothers, faith, loss, all that stuff in our closets, and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn't know who I was. Then I invented someone, and became her. Then I began to like what I'd invented. And finally I was what I was again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out I wasn't alone in that particular progression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she did in her beloved New York Times columns, and in A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen says for us here what we may wish we could have said ourselves. Using her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages, Quindlen talks about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriage: "A safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn't believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girlfriends: "Real friends offer both hard truths and soft landings and realize that it's sometimes more important to be nice than to be honest." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our bodies: "I've finally recognized my body for what it is, a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come. It's like a car, and while I like a red convertible or even a Bentley as well as the next person, what I really need are four tires and an engine."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parenting: "Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward: We are good parents, not so they will be loving enough to stay with us, but so they will be strong enough to leave us." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, Quindlen uses the events of her own life to illuminate our own. Along with the downsides of age, she says, can come wisdom, a perspective on life that makes it both satisfying and even joyful. So here's to lots of candles, plenty of cake.</description>

  <description>BONUS FEATURE: Enhanced CD featuring photos, maps, and illustrations from the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more than one hundred years, a submarine lay buried beneath the ocean floor near Charleston, South Carolina. This Civil War stealth weapon–the &lt;i&gt;H. L. Hunley&lt;/i&gt;–made history in 1864 as the first submarine ever to sink an enemy ship. But something went wrong during that daring mission. The &lt;i&gt;Hunley&lt;/i&gt; never returned to port. &lt;br /&gt; Despite decades of searching, the &lt;i&gt;Hunley&lt;/i&gt; remained unfound. In 1995 her story took a startling turn. As she had during the Civil War, the &lt;i&gt;Hunley&lt;/i&gt; once again made newspaper headlines. How the submarine came to be on the ocean floor, how she came to leave it, and what happened next make up one of the most compelling stories in the history of archaeology and the history of the Civil War–an amazing tale of bravery, mystery, bones, and gold.</description>

  <description>David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet--and it just might be his very best.</description>

  <description>After eight commanding works of fiction, the Pulitzer Prize winner now turns to memoir in a hilarious, moving, and always surprising account of his life, his parents, and the upstate New York town they all struggled variously to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone familiar with Richard Russo's acclaimed novels will recognize Gloversville once famous for producing that eponymous product and anything else made of leather. This is where the author grew up, the only son of an aspirant mother and a charming, feckless father who were born into this close-knit community. But by the time of his childhood in the 1950s, prosperity was inexorably being replaced by poverty and illness (often tannery-related), with everyone barely scraping by under a very low horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world elsewhere was the dream his mother instilled in Rick, and strived for herself, and their subsequent adventures and tribulations in achieving that goal—beautifully recounted here—were to prove lifelong, as would Gloversville's fearsome grasp on them both. Fraught with the timeless dynamic of going home again, encompassing hopes and fears and the relentless tides of familial and individual complications, this story is arresting, comic, heartbreaking, and truly beautiful, an immediate classic.</description>

  <description>In 1848, the British East India Company, having lost its monopoly on the tea trade, engaged Robert Fortune, a Scottish gardener, botanist, and plant hunter, to make a clandestine trip into the interior of China—territory forbidden to foreigners—to steal the closely guarded secrets of tea horticulture and manufacturing. &lt;i&gt;For All the Tea in China&lt;/i&gt; is the remarkable account of Fortune's journeys into China—a thrilling narrative that combines history, geography, botany, natural science, and old-fashioned adventure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Disguised in Mandarin robes, Fortune ventured deep into the country, confronting pirates, hostile climate, and his own untrustworthy men as he made his way to the epicenter of tea production, the remote Wu Yi Shan hills. One of the most daring acts of corporate espionage in history, Fortune's pursuit of China's ancient secret makes for a classic nineteenth-century adventure tale, one in which the fate of empires hinges on the feats of one extraordinary man.</description>

  <description>Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction. Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In Norse Mythology, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With over 100 combat missions, and 24 years as a Green Beret, Changiz Lahidji is an expert in military operations. &lt;i&gt;Full Battle Rattle&lt;/i&gt; is the legendary audiobook memoir of a soldier who served America in every war since Vietnam.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master Sergeant Changiz Lahidji served on Special Forces A teams longer than anyone in history, completing over a hundred combat missions in Afghanistan. Changiz is a Special Forces legend. He also happens to be the first Muslim Green Beret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changiz served this country starting with Operation Eagle Claw in 1980, when he entered Tehran on a one-man mission to spy on Iranian soldiers guarding the US Embassy where 52 US diplomats were being held hostage. Three years later, he was in Beirut, Lebanon when a suicide car bomb exploded in front of the US Embassy killing 83 people. Weeks after that, he was shot by Hezbollah terrorists on a night mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Operation Iraqi Freedom, he led a convoy that was ambushed on its way to Fallujah. He was clearing houses in Mogadishu, Somalia on October, 1993 when a US Black Hawk helicopter was shot down 50 feet away from him in the incident that inspired &lt;i&gt;Black Hawk Down&lt;/i&gt;. In 2002, he dressed as a farmer and snuck into Eastern Afghanistan and located Osama Bin Laden for the CIA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Changiz earned numerous commendations, including the Special Forces Legion of Merit, Purple Hearts, and many others. Last year he was nominated for induction in Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and cited as "the finest noncommissioned officer to ever serve in Special Forces."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written with Ralph Pezzullo, Changiz's story is an amazing audiobook of perseverance and courage, of combat and one man's love for his adopted country.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of The Prince of Providence comes a revelatory biography of Rocky Marciano, the greatest heavyweight champion of all time.The son of poor Italian immigrants, with short arms and stubby legs, Rocky Marciano accomplished a feat that eluded legendary heavyweight champions like Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson: he never lost a professional fight. His record was a perfect 49-0.Unbeaten is the story of this remarkable champion who overcame injury, doubt, and the schemes of corrupt promoters to win the title in a bloody and epic battle with Jersey Joe Walcott in 1952. Rocky packed a devastating punch with an innocent nickname, "Suzie Q," against which there was no defense. As the champ, he came to know presidents and movie stars-and the organized crime figures who dominated the sport, much to his growing disgust. He may have "stood out in boxing like a rose in a garbage dump," as one sportswriter said, but he also fought his own private demons.In the hands of prizewinning journalist and biographer Mike Stanton, Unbeaten is more than just a boxing story. It's a classic American tale of immigrant dreams, exceptional talent wedded to exceptional ambitions, compromises in the service of a greater good, astounding success, disillusionment, and a quest to discover what it all meant. Like Suzie Q, it will knock you off your feet.</description>

  <description>On the morning of August 15, 1945, Captain Jerry Yellin flew the last combat mission of World War II out of Iwo Jima. Today, Captain Yellin is a sharp, engaging, ninety-three-year-old veteran whose story is brought to life by bestselling author Don Brown (Treason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From April to August of 1945, Captain Jerry Yellin and a small group of fellow fighter pilots flew dangerous bombing and strafing missions out of Iwo Jima over Japan. Even days after America dropped the atomic bombs-on Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on August 9-the pilots continued to fly. Though Japan had suffered unimaginable devastation, the emperor still refused to surrender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Don Brown sits down with Yellin to tell the incredible true story of the final combat mission of World War II. Nine days after Hiroshima, on the morning of August 15, Yellin and his wingman First Lieutenant Philip Schlamberg took off from Iwo Jima to bomb Tokyo. By the time Yellin returned to Iwo Jima, the war was officially over-but his young friend Schlamberg would never get to hear the news. The Last Fighter Pilot is a harrowing first-person account of war from one of America's last living World War II veterans.</description>

  <description>Gold Dust Woman gives "the gold standard of rock biographers" (the Boston Globe) his ideal topic: Nicks' work and life are equally sexy and interesting, and Davis delves deeply into each, unearthing fresh details from new, intimate interviews and interpreting them to present a rich new portrait of the star. Just as Nicks (and Lindsay Buckingham) gave Fleetwood Mac the "shot of adrenaline" they needed to become real rock stars-according to Christine McVie-Gold Dust Woman is vibrant with stories and with a life lived large and hard: ●How Nicks and Buckingham were asked to join Fleetwood Mac and how they turned the band into stars ●The affairs that informed Nicks' greatest songs ●Her relationships with the Eagles' Don Henley and Joe Walsh, and with Fleetwood himself ●Why Nicks married her best friend's widower ●Her dependency on cocaine, drinking and pot, but how it was a decade-long addiction to Klonopin that almost killed her ●Nicks' successful solo career that has her still performing in venues like Madison Square Garden ●The cult of Nicks and its extension to chart-toppers like Taylor Swift and the Dixie Chicks</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling coauthor of &lt;em&gt;American Sniper &lt;/em&gt;brings the Pony Express to life in this rich and rollicking new history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"One can hear horse hooves pounding across the prairie and sense the fear and courage and excitement." —Tom Clavin, author of &lt;em&gt;Dodge City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;n the eve of the Civil War, three American businessmen launched an audacious plan to create a financial empire by transforming communications across the hostile territory between the nation’s two coasts. In the process, they created one of the most enduring icons of the American West: the Pony Express. Daring young men with colorful names like “Bronco Charlie” and “Sawed-Off Jim” galloped at speed over a vast and unforgiving landscape, etching an irresistible tale that passed into myth almost instantly. Equally an improbable success and a business disaster, the Pony Express came and went in just eighteen months, but not before uniting and captivating a nation on the brink of being torn apart. Jim DeFelice’s brilliantly entertaining &lt;em&gt;West Like Lightning &lt;/em&gt;is the first major history of the Pony Express to put its birth, life, and legacy into the full context of the American story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company—or “Pony Express,” as it came to be known—was part of a plan by William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William Waddell to create the next American Express, a transportation and financial juggernaut that already dominated commerce back east. All that stood in their way were almost two thousand miles of uninhabited desert, ice-capped mountains, oceanic plains roamed by Indian tribes, whitewater-choked rivers, and harsh, unsettled wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pony used a relay system of courageous horseback riders to ferry mail halfway across a continent in just ten days. The challenges the riders faced were enormous, yet the Pony Express succeeded, delivering thousands of letters at record speed. The service instantly became the most direct means of communication between the eastern United States and its far western territories, helping to firmly connect them to the Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Populated with cast of characters including Abraham Lincoln (news of whose electoral victory the Express delivered to California), Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody (who fed the legend of the Express in his Wild West Show), and Mark Twain (who celebrated the riders in &lt;em&gt;Roughing It&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;West Like Lightning &lt;/em&gt;masterfully traces the development of the Pony Express and follows it from its start in St. Joseph, Missouri—the edge of the civilized world—west to Sacramento, the capital of California, then booming from the gold rush. Jim DeFelice, who traveled the Pony’s route in his research, plumbs the legends, myths, and surprising truth of the service, exploring its lasting relevance today as a symbol of American enterprise, audacity, and daring.</description>

  <description>Dick Van Dyke, indisputably one of the greats of the golden age of television, is admired and beloved by audiences the world over for his beaming smile, his physical dexterity, his impeccable comic timing, his ridiculous stunts, and his unforgettable screen roles. &lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;His trailblazing television program, &lt;i&gt;The Dick Van Dyke&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Show &lt;/i&gt;(produced by Carl Reiner, who has written the foreword to this memoir), was one of the most popular sitcoms of the 1960s and introduced another major television star, Mary Tyler Moore. But Dick Van Dyke was also an enormously engaging movie star whose films, including &lt;i&gt;Mary Poppins &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&lt;/i&gt;, have been discovered by a new generation of fans and are as beloved today as they were when they first appeared. Who doesn’t know the word &lt;i&gt;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;A colorful, loving, richly detailed look at the decades of a multilayered life, &lt;i&gt;My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business, &lt;/i&gt;will enthrall every generation of reader, from baby-boomers who recall when Rob Petrie became a household name, to all those still enchanted by Bert’s “Chim Chim Cher-ee.” This is a lively, heartwarming memoir of a performer who still thinks of himself as a “simple song-and-dance man,” but who is, in every sense of the word, a classic entertainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The incredible untold story of WWII's greatest secret fighting force, as told by our great modern master of wartime intrigue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britain's Special Air Service--or SAS--was the brainchild of David Stirling, a young, gadabout aristocrat whose aimlessness in early life belied a remarkable strategic mind. Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II's African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel's desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war material. Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war, but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS's remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in the Africa and then on the Continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy. The result is not just a tremendous war story, but a fascinating group portrait of men of whom history and country asked the most.</description>

  <description>   In this powerful and culminating work about a group of inner-city children he has known for many years, Jonathan Kozol returns to the scene of his prize-winning books &lt;i&gt;Rachel and Her Children&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/i&gt;, and to the children he has vividly portrayed, to share with us their fascinating journeys and unexpected victories as they grow into adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   For nearly fifty years Jonathan has pricked the conscience of his readers by laying bare the savage inequalities inflicted upon children for no reason but the accident of being born to poverty within a wealthy nation. A winner of the National Book Award, the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, and countless other honors, he has persistently crossed the lines of class and race, first as a teacher, then as the author of tender and heart-breaking books about the children he has called “the outcasts of our nation’s ingenuity.” But Jonathan is not a distant and detached reporter. His own life has been radically transformed by the children who have trusted and befriended him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Never has this intimate acquaintance with his subjects been more apparent, or more stirring, than in &lt;i&gt;Fire in the Ashes&lt;/i&gt;, as Jonathan tells the stories of young men and women who have come of age in one of the most destitute communities of the United States. Some of them never do recover from the battering they undergo in their early years, but many more battle back with fierce and, often, jubilant determination to overcome the formidable obstacles they face. As we watch these glorious children grow into the fullness of a healthy and contributive maturity, they ignite a flame of hope, not only for themselves, but for our society.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   The urgent issues that confront our urban schools – a devastating race-gap, a pathological regime of obsessive testing and drilling students for exams instead of giving them the rich curriculum that excites a love of learning – are interwoven through these stories. Why certain children rise above it all, graduate from high school and do well in college, while others are defeated by the time they enter adolescence, lies at the essence of this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Jonathan Kozol is the author of &lt;i&gt;Death at an Early Age&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Savage Inequalities&lt;/i&gt;, and other books on children and their education. He has been called “today’s most eloquent spokesman for America’s disenfranchised.” But he believes young people speak most eloquently for themselves; and in this book, so full of the vitality and spontaneity of youth, we hear their testimony.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The definitive autobiography from hockey’s greatest living legend—“Mr. Hockey” himself, Gordie Howe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Big, skilled, tough on the ice, and nearly indestructible, Howe dominated both the sport and the record books like no one has before or since. Over an incredible six decades, the Hall of Famer had so many accomplishments that he set the record for the most records by any athlete ever in any sport. He also achieved the remarkable feat of playing for six years with his own two sons, Mark and Marty.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Howe did not inspire generations of hockey players simply by rewriting the record books. When people talk about him, it’s the man they revere even more than the player. Despite his ferocity on the ice, Howe’s name has long been a byword for decency and generosity. A family man, a man of his word, a lifelong ambassador for the game, he is a true icon, and now he takes us through it all, from his Depression-era childhood and early obstacles through the ups and downs of his spectacular career, to his enduring marriage and close relationship with his children, to his thoughts on the game of hockey today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There has never been a comprehensive account of Howe’s life from the man himself. Now is the time.</description>

  <description>He was the Sultan of Swat. The Caliph of Clout. The Wizard of Whack. The Bambino. And simply, to his teammates, the Big Bam. From the award-winning author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Ted Williams&lt;/i&gt; comes the thoroughly original, definitively ambitious, and exhilaratingly colorful biography of the largest legend ever to loom in baseball—and in the history of organized sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“[Montville is] one of America’s best sportswriters.” —&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babe Ruth was more than baseball’s original superstar. For eighty-five years, he has remained the sport’s reigning titan. He has been named Athlete of the Century . . . more than once. But who &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;this large, loud, enigmatic man? Why is so little known about his childhood, his private life, and his inner thoughts? In &lt;i&gt;The Big Bam&lt;/i&gt;, Leigh Montville, whose recent &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling biography of Ted Williams garnered glowing reviews and offered an exceptionally intimate look at Williams’s life, brings his trademark touch to this groundbreaking, revelatory portrait of the Babe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on newly discovered documents and interviews—including pages from Ruth’s personal scrapbooks —&lt;i&gt;The Big Bam&lt;/i&gt; traces Ruth’s life from his bleak childhood in Baltimore to his brash entrance into professional baseball, from Boston to New York and into the record books as the world’s most explosive slugger and cultural luminary. Montville explores every aspect of the man, paying particular attention to the myths that have always surrounded him. Did he really hit the “called shot” homer in the 1932 World Series? Were his home runs really “the farthest balls ever hit” in countless ballparks around the country? Was he really part black—making him the first African American professional baseball superstar? And was Ruth the high-octane, womanizing, heavy-drinking “fatso” of legend . . . or just a boyish, rudderless quasi-orphan who did, in fact, take his training and personal conditioning quite seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when modern baseball is grappling with hyper-inflated salaries, free agency, and assorted controversies, &lt;i&gt;The Big Bam&lt;/i&gt; brings back the pure glory days of the game. Leigh Montville operates at the peak of his abilities, exploring Babe Ruth in a way that intimately, and poignantly, illuminates a most remarkable figure.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Millionaires' Unit&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a gilded generation of young men from the zenith of privilege: a Rockerfeller, the son of the head of the Union Pacific Railroad, several who counted friends and relatives among presidents and statesmen of the day. They had it all and, remarkably by modern standards, they were prepared to risk it all to fight a distant war in France. Driven by the belief that their membership in the American elite required certain sacrifice, schooled in heroism and the nature of leadership, they determined to be first into the conflict, leading the way ahead of America's declaration that it would join the war. At the heart of the group was the Yale flying club, six of whom are the heroes of this book. They would share rivalries over girlfriends, jealousies over membership in Skull and Bones, and fierce ambition to be the most daring young man over the battlefields of France, where the casualties among flyers were chillingly high. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One of the six would go on to become the principal architect of the American Air Force's first strategic bomber force. Others would bring home decorations and tales of high life experiences in Paris. Some would not return, having made the greatest sacrifice of all in perhaps the last noble war. For readers of &lt;i&gt;Flyboys&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Generation&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Flags of Our Fathers&lt;/i&gt;, this patriotic, romantic, absorbing book is narrative military history of the best kind.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; Length: 6 hrs and 27 mins &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through the eyes of current and former Navy SEALs, EYES ON TARGET is an inside account of some of the most harrowing missions in American history-including the mission to kill Osama bin Laden and the mission that wasn't, the deadly attack on the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi where a retired SEAL sniper with a small team held off one hundred terrorists while his repeated radio calls for help went unheeded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The book contains incredible accounts of major SEAL operations-from the violent birth of SEAL Team Six and the aborted Operation Eagle Claw meant to save the hostages in Iran, to key missions in Iraq and Afganistan where the SEALs suffered their worst losses in their fifty year history-and every chapter illustrates why this elite military special operations unit remains the most feared anti-terrorist force in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We hear reports on the record from retired SEAL officers including Lt. Cmdr. Richard Marcinko, the founder of SEAL Team Six, and a former Commander at SEAL team Six, Ryan Zinke, and we come away understanding the deep commitment of these military men who put themselves in danger to protect our country and save American lives. In the face of insurmountable odds and the imminent threat of death, they give all to protect those who cannot protect themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No matter the situation, on duty or at ease, SEALs never, ever give up. One powerful chapter in the book tells the story of how one Medal of Honor winner saved another, the only time this has been done in US military history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; EYES ON TARGET includes these special features: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A detailed timeline of events during the Benghazi attack Sample rescue scenarios from a military expert who believes that help could have reached the Benghazi compound in time The US House Republican Conference Interim Progress Report on the events surrounding the September 11, 2012 Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi Through their many interviews and unique access, Scott McEwen and Richard Miniter pull back the veil that has so often concealed the heroism of these patriots. They live by a stringent and demanding code of their own creation, keeping them ready to ignore politics, bureaucracy and-if necessary-direct orders. They share a unique combination of character, intelligence, courage, love of country and what can only be called true grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They are the Navy SEALs, and they keep their Eyes on Target.</description>

  <description>Secret Service agents, acting as human surveillance cameras, observe everything that goes on behind the scenes in the president's inner circle. Ronald Kessler reveals what they have seen, providing startling, previously untold stories about the presidents, from John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as about their families, Cabinet officers, and White House aides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kessler portrays the dangers that agents face and how they carry out their missions—from how they are trained to how they spot and assess potential threats. With fly-on-the-wall perspective, he captures the drama and tension that characterize agents' lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this headline-grabbing book, Kessler discloses assassination attempts that have never before been revealed. He shares inside accounts of past assaults that have put the Secret Service to the test, including a heroic gun battle that took down the would-be assassins of Harry S. Truman, the devastating day that John F. Kennedy was killed in Dallas, and the swift actions that saved Ronald Reagan after he was shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While Secret Service agents are brave and dedicated, Kessler exposes how Secret Service management in recent years has betrayed its mission by cutting corners, risking the assassination of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and their families. Given the lax standards, "It's a miracle we have not had a successful assassination," a current agent says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since an assassination jeopardizes democracy itself, few agencies are as important as the Secret Service—and few subjects are as tantalizing as the inner sanctum of the White House. Only tight-lipped Secret Service agents know the real story, and Kessler is the only journalist to have won their trust.</description>

  <description>Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence, and God would provide clear, understandable answers? It happened to Neale Donald Walsch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversations with God is Neale Donald Walsch's account of his direct conversations with God, beginning in 1992 while Walsch was immersed in a period of deep depression. He composed a letter to God in which he vented his frustrations, and much to his surprise, even shock, God answered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focusing on the universal truths that influence all life, Conversations with God offers a picture of the could be better. Conversations with God challenges us to push past the imagined boundaries of what we believe ourselves capable and look instead to all that we can attain as co-creators with God.</description>

  <description>A tense, powerful, grand account of one of the most daring exploits of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On January 28, 1945, 121 hand-selected troops from the elite U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines. Their mission: March thirty miles in an attempt to rescue 513 American and British POWs who had spent three years in a surreally hellish camp near the city of Cabanatuan. The prisoners included the last survivors of the Bataan Death March left in the camp, and their extraordinary will to live might soon count for nothing—elsewhere in the Philippines, the Japanese Army had already executed American prisoners as it retreated from the advancing U.S. Army. As the Rangers stealthily moved through enemy-occupied territory, they learned that Cabanatuan had become a major transshipment point for the Japanese retreat, and instead of facing the few dozen prison guards, they could possibly confront as many as 8,000 battle-hardened enemy troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hampton Sides's vivid minute-by-minute narration of the raid and his chronicle of the prisoners' wrenching experiences are masterful. But &lt;b&gt;Ghost Soldiers&lt;/b&gt; is far more than a thrilling battle saga. Hampton Sides explores the mystery of human behavior under extreme duress—the resilience of the prisoners, who defied the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and unspeakable tortures; the violent cultural clashes with Japanese guards and soldiers steeped in the warrior ethic of Bushido; the remarkable heroism of the Rangers and Filipino guerrillas; the complex motivations of the U.S. high command, some of whom could justly be charged with abandoning the men of Bataan in 1942; and the nearly suicidal bravado of several spies, including priests and a cabaret owner, who risked their lives to help the prisoners during their long ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a gripping depiction of men at war and a compelling story of redemption, &lt;b&gt;Ghost Soldiers&lt;/b&gt; joins such landmark books as &lt;b&gt;Flags of Our Fathers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; The Greatest Generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rape of Nanking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;b&gt;D-Day&lt;/b&gt; in preserving the legacy of World War II for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Over the years, numerous professors have given talks entitled "The Last Lecture." For Carnegie Mellon University professor Randy Pausch, however, the topic was no mere formality. When he presented his "last lecture" to hundreds of faculty and students last September, he already knew that he had metastatic pancreatic cancer. Despite a grim prognosis, Dr. Pausch delivered an upbeat, urgent call for his listeners to achieve their childhood dreams. Since then, this good-natured computer science specialist has become a worldwide celebrity; named "Person of the Week" by ABC News and invited to be a guest on &lt;i&gt;Oprah&lt;/i&gt;. This memoir recounts the story of a brave man's encounter with a sense of his own mortality. An inspiring message for anyone who ages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4 1/2 hours)</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;"The life of a good dog is like the life of a good person, only shorter and more compressed."&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;p&gt; So writes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anna Quindlen about her beloved black Labrador retriever, Beau. With her trademark wisdom and humor, Quindlen reflects on how her life has unfolded in tandem with Beau's, and on the lessons she's learned by watching him: to roll with the punches, to take things as they come, to measure herself not in terms of the past or the future but of the present, to raise her nose in the air from time to time and, at least metaphorically, holler, "I smell bacon!" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the dog that once possessed a catcher's mitt of a mouth, Quindlen reminisces, "There came a time when a scrap thrown in his direction usually bounced unseen off his head. Yet put a pork roast in the oven, and the guy still breathed as audibly as an obscene caller. The eyes and ears may have gone, but the nose was eternal. And the tail. The tail still wagged, albeit at half-staff. When it stops, I thought more than once, then we'll know." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartening and bittersweet, &lt;i&gt;Good Dog. Stay.&lt;/i&gt; honors the life of a cherished and loyal friend and offers us a valuable lesson on our four-legged family members: Sometimes an old dog can teach us new tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Where do we search to find Happiness and Success? The deep happiness, the fulfilling and peaceful place we all desire. In Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success James Allen shows us where to begin to search and how to start building a strong foundation on which to build our happiness and success."It is wise to know what comes first, and what to do first. To begin anything in the middle or at the end is to make a muddle of it."James Allen was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and poetry and as a pioneer of self-help movement. Allen's practical philosophy for successful living has awakened millions to the discovery that "they themselves are makers of themselves." Allen insists that it is within the power of each person to form his own character and create his own happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Louisa May Alcott&lt;/i&gt; portrays a writer as worthy of interest in her own right as her most famous character, Jo March, and addresses all aspects of Alcott's life: the effect of her father's self-indulgent utopian schemes; her family's chronic economic difficulties and frequent uprootings; her experience as a nurse in the Civil War; and the loss of her health and frequent recourse to opiates in search of relief from migraines, insomnia, and symptomatic pain. Stories and details culled from Alcott's journals; her equally rich letters to family, friends, publishers, and admiring readers; and the correspondence, journals, and recollections of her family, friends, and famous contemporaries provide the basis for this lively account of the author's classic rags-to-riches tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alcott would become the equivalent of a multimillionaire in her lifetime based on the astounding sales of her books, leaving contemporaries like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Henry James in the dust. This biography explores Alcott's life in the context of her works, all of which are to some extent autobiographical. A fresh, modern take on this remarkable and prolific writer, who secretly authored pulp fiction, harbored radical abolitionist views, and completed heroic service as a Civil War nurse, &lt;i&gt;Louisa May Alcott&lt;/i&gt; is also the story of how the all-time beloved American classic &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; came to be. This revelatory portrait will present the popular author as she was and as she has never been seen before.</description>

  <description>In the classic tradition of Sun Tzu’s &lt;i&gt;The Art of War&lt;/i&gt;, here for the first time in English is the timeless wisdom of China’s greatest emperor Tang Taizong (598-649 AD) which will show anyone who leads or manages how to achieve unparalleled results and an enduring legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tang Taizong was arguably the greatest Emperor in Chinese history. In Asia, many historians rank him with such rulers as Augustus, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon. When he founded the Tang dynasty, Taizong was only twenty-eight years old, and his chief accomplishments were on the battlefield, where he personally slew 1,000 of the enemy. Ultimately, Taizong would defeat the descendants of Genghis Khan’s Huns, enact a vastly simplified code of laws, open up the Silk Road trading route, create a golden age of cosmopolitan culture, and by his attitudes on religious tolerance introduce Buddhism into Tibet and invite Catholicism into China. His dynasty would last 300 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ruler’s Guide &lt;/i&gt;is the first publication in English of the leadership principles modeled and articulated by this unusual ruler, who populated his court with advisors who were required to criticize him on a daily basis. Taizong’s dialogues with the wisest of his counselors form the core of this book, which is a manual for managing in &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;sphere, whether it be government, business, the military, athletics, philanthropy, or even parenting. Here, author Chinghua Tang presents conversations between Taizong and his advisers that explain how to attain self-knowledge; evaluate people and appraise talent; lead effectively; grow power and influence; compete with rivals; listen to others with different views; treat subordinates; enhance organizational effectiveness; practice the art of war; achieve long-term success; draw lessons from the rise and fall of great empires; and craft one’s legacy.</description>

  <description>In this timeless classic of personal time management, famed novelist Arnold Bennett writes: "You have to live on ... twenty—four hours of daily time. Out of it you have to spin health, pleasure, money, content, respect, and the evolution of your immortal soul. Its right use, its most effective use, is a matter of the highest urgency and of the most thrilling actuality." How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, a book that has helped millions throughout the world, tells you how to make the most of "the daily miracle"—the fresh allotment of time you receive every day of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Biography: Arnold Bennett (1867 1931) is the author of The Old Wives' Tale, Anna of the Five Towns, and numerous other novels. During his lifetime, however, he was best known for his Pocket Philosophies, of which How to Live on 24 hours a Day is by far the most famous. He reported that the book "brought me more letters of appreciation than all my other books put together."</description>

  <description>Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 – April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, and entertainer, remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and for founding the circus that became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey Circus.&lt;br /&gt;His successes may have made him the first "show business" millionaire. Although Barnum was also an author, publisher, philanthropist, and for some time a politician, he said of himself, "I am a showman by profession...and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me," and his personal aims were "to put money in his own coffers".

  <description>A New Yorker writer revisits the seminal book of her youth--Middlemarch--and fashions a singular, involving story of how a passionate attachment to a great work of literature can shape our lives and help us to read our own histories. Rebecca Mead was a young woman in an English coastal town when she first read George Eliot's Middlemarch, regarded by many as the greatest English novel. After gaining admission to Oxford and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage, and family, Mead read and reread Middlemarch. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people," offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not. In this wise and revealing work of biography, reportage, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that deftly mirrors that of the novel, My Life in Middlemarch takes the themes of Eliot's masterpiece--the complexity of love, the meaning of marriage, the foundations of morality, and the drama of aspiration and failure--and brings them into our world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an exploration of the way aspects of Mead's life uncannily echo that of the author herself, My Life in Middlemarch is for every ardent lover of literature who cares about why we read books, and how they read us.</description>

  <description>Packed with revelations, this is the first complete account of a career built on raw talent, sheer willpower--and criminal connections. Anthony Summers--bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe&lt;/i&gt;--and Robbyn Swan unveil stunning new information about Sinatra’s links to the Mafia, his crowded love life and his tangled relationships with U.S. presidents. Exclusive breakthroughs include the discovery of how the Mafia connection began--in a remote Sicilian village--and moving interviews with his lovers. Never-before-published conversations with Ava Gardner get to the core of the tragic passion that dominated his life, came close to destroying him, and made his best work heartbreakingly personal. &lt;i&gt;Sinatra&lt;/i&gt; delivers the full life story of a complex, flawed genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1979, Larry Jones was ministering in Haiti, where he was approached by a young boy who hadn't eaten all day. The child asked for a nickel to buy a roll. Recalling the wheat surplus back home in Oklahoma, Jones soon started Feed The Children, initially a wheat-exporting outreach, that grew into one of the world's largest and most respected charities. Year after year, it efficiently distributes food and other essentials to impoverished families throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world. In this audio, Jones describes his journey from a childhood as the son of two barbers in America's heartland to a career that takes him to war-torn countries and areas devastated by natural disasters-as well as into the halls of Congress and the offices of foreign governments to solicit support and funding. Rich in moving stories, Keep Walking offers vivid insights into the faith that moved Jones to do God's work and shows listeners that they, too, can make a difference.</description>

  <description>Nora Ephron returns with her first audiobook since the astounding success of &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck&lt;/i&gt;, taking a cool, hard, hilarious look at the past, the present, and the future, bemoaning the vicissitudes of modern life, and recalling with her signature clarity and wisdom everything she hasn’t (yet) forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ephron writes about falling hard for a way of life (“Journalism: A Love Story”) and about breaking up even harder with the men in her life (“The D Word”); lists “Twenty-five Things People Have a Shocking Capacity to Be Surprised by Over and Over Again” (“There is no explaining the stock market but people try”; “Cary Grant was Jewish”; “Men cheat”); reveals the alarming evolution, a decade after she wrote and directed &lt;i&gt;You’ve Got Mail&lt;/i&gt;, of her relationship with her in-box (“The Six Stages of E-Mail”); and asks the age-old question, which came first, the chicken soup or the cold? All the while, she gives candid, edgy voice to everything women who have reached a certain age have been thinking . . . but rarely acknowledging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with insights and observations that instantly ring true—and could have come only from Nora Ephron—&lt;i&gt;I Remember Nothing&lt;/i&gt; is pure joy.</description>

  <description>The author of &lt;em&gt;Passages&lt;/em&gt;, a book that changed millions of lives, now lays bare her own life passages in a captivating memoir that reveals her harrowing and ultimately triumphant path from groundbreaking 1960s "girl" journalist to fearless bestselling author who made a career of excavating cultural taboos—from sex, menopause, and midlife crisis to illness, caregiving, and death. Daring to blaze a trail in a "man's world," Gail Sheehy became one of the premier practitioners of New Journalism at the fledgling &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine, along with such stellar writers as Tom Wolfe, Gloria Steinem, and Jimmy Breslin. Sheehy dared to walk New York City's streets with hookers and pimps to expose violent prostitution; to march with civil rights protesters in Northern Ireland as British soldiers opened fire; to seek out Egypt's president Anwar Sadat when he was targeted for assassination after making peace with Israel; and to break the glass ceiling in a media world fueled by testosterone, competition, and grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring: My Passages&lt;/em&gt; is also the beguiling love story of Sheehy's tempestuous romance with Clay Felker, the charismatic creator of &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine and the mentor who inspired her to become a fearless journalist who won renown for her penetrating character portraits of world leaders, including Hillary Clinton, both Presidents Bush, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, among others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheehy reflects on desire, ambition, and &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; it all—career, love, children, friends, social significance—and coming to terms with waiting until midlife to achieve it all. With candor and humor, she describes her early failures; the pain of betrayal in a first marriage; her struggles as a single mother; the flings of an ardent, liberated young woman; the vertigo of becoming an internationally bestselling author; her adoption of a second daughter from a refugee camp; the poignant account of Clay's decline; and her ongoing passion for life, work, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinating and no-holds-barred, &lt;em&gt;Daring: My Passages&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to guts, resilience, and smarts, and offers a bold perspective on all of life's passages.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On March 14, 2012, more than three million people read Greg Smith's bombshell Op-Ed in the New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs." The column immediately went viral, became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, and drew passionate responses from former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous "take-the-money-and-run" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a "vampire squid" that referred to its clients as "muppets" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly. He walked away from his career and took matters into his own hands. This is his story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>By 2002, The Streak�a historic 13-year run of consecutive wins by the Spartans, a high-school football team from Concord, California, that couldn't be beat�was still going strong. In this revised edition of When the Game Stands Tall, author Neil Hayes, who had unrestricted access to the De La Salle team, writes from the inside about the games, the players, and their visionary coach, Bob Ladouceur, who managed to amass the highest winning percentage in football history (.995) through standing for something greater than winning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audiobook, which also features interviews with major sports figures like Bill Walsh and John Gruden, is a revealing portrait of the coach who believed above all in instilling basic life skills where winning is not the goal, but merely the byproduct of playing the game. The Streak had become a national story long before it ended in September 2004. In this revised edition, Neil Hayes catches up on the lives of the main characters and takes listeners through the final tumultuous year. What results is a timeless and inspirational story of struggle, tragedy, and triumph.</description>

  <description>Author Mitch Stephen has been a self-employed, creative real estate investor for over 20 years. He bought and sold well over 1,000 houses in his hometown and specializes in "The Art of Owner Financing." He has written two other books centered on his experience in real estate... MY LIFE &amp;amp; 1,000 HOUSES: Failing Forward to Financial Freedom MY LIFE &amp;amp; 1,000 HOUSES: 200+ Ways to Find Bargain Properties This book, MY LIFE &amp;amp; 1,000 HOUSES: The Art of Owner Financing, is an insider's look at a very powerful strategy for building wealth quickly. In this book you're going to learn... - How to get paid to build your cash flow. - How to generate cash flow without being a landlord. - How to get paid six ways on your deals. - How to recognize what properties are good to owner finance. - How to make money on the properties that aren't good to owner finance. - How to find private money for your deals. - How to sell notes with little to no discount. ...and much, much more! Tired of being a landlord? Are you tired of all the late night phone calls about leaking toilets, busted hot water heaters, broken air conditioners, and on and on and on? If so, this book is a must read! For years the gurus of the day have been selling us the "Buy &amp;amp; Hold" myth. Most landlords have fooled themselves into thinking they're making money. Year after year would-be-retirees have to postpone their retirement because the rental income they calculated on paper never makes it to their tax return. Mitch can show you exactly why this is happening and how to stop it from happening by using a strategy that is less known and grossly misunderstood. The owner financing strategy changes everything! Change your property's value. Change your community for the better. Change your buyer's life, and change your personal financial situation in the process. All kinds of doors open when we stop using broken down traditional techniques and start thinking outside the box. And best of all, 90% of the deals are done with none of your own money! The strategies in this book are mind-blowing! Mitch believes that real estate investing is a tremendous strategy for acquiring wealth. He has helped new investors find their place; He has helped veteran investors re-invent themselves by BECOMING THE BANK!

  <description>For the first time, legendary singer, songwriter, and guitarist Neil Young offers a kaleidoscopic view of his personal life and musical creativity. He tells of his childhood in Ontario, where his father instilled in him a love for the written word; his first brush with mortality when he contracted polio at the age of five; struggling to pay rent during his early days with the Squires; traveling the Canadian prairies in Mort, his 1948 Buick hearse; performing in a remote town as a polar bear prowled beneath the floorboards; leaving Canada on a whim in 1966 to pursue his musical dreams in the pot-filled boulevards and communal canyons of Los Angeles; the brief but influential life of Buffalo Springfield, which formed almost immediately after his arrival in California. He recounts their rapid rise to fame and ultimate break-up; going solo and overcoming his fear of singing alone; forming Crazy Horse and writing “Cinnamon Girl,” “Cowgirl in the Sand,” and “Down by the River” in one day while sick with the flu; joining Crosby, Stills &amp;amp; Nash, recording the landmark CSNY album, &lt;i&gt;Déjà vu, &lt;/i&gt;and writing the song, “Ohio;” life at his secluded ranch in the redwoods of Northern California and the pot-filled jam sessions there; falling in love with his wife, Pegi, and the birth of his three children; and finally, finding the contemplative paradise of Hawaii. Astoundingly candid, witty, and as uncompromising and true as his music, &lt;i&gt;Waging Heavy Peace &lt;/i&gt;is Neil Young’s journey as only he can tell it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt;, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albom's first nonfiction book since &lt;i&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt; begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt; is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this “powerful personal story woven with a rich analysis of what we all seek” (Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google), Mo Gawdat, Chief Business Officer at Google’s [X], applies his superior logic and problem solving skills to understand how the brain processes joy and sadness—and then he solves for happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2001 Mo Gawdat realized that despite his incredible success, he was desperately unhappy. A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for permanent happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen years later, Mo’s algorithm would be put to the ultimate test. After the sudden death of his son, Ali, Mo and his family turned to his equation—and it saved them from despair. In dealing with the horrible loss, Mo found his mission: he would pull off the type of “moonshot” goal that he and his colleagues were always aiming for—he would share his equation with the world and help as many people as possible become happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Solve for Happy&lt;/i&gt; Mo questions some of the most fundamental aspects of our existence, shares the underlying reasons for suffering, and plots out a step-by-step process for achieving lifelong happiness and enduring contentment. He shows us how to view life through a clear lens, teaching us how to dispel the illusions that cloud our thinking; overcome the brain’s blind spots; and embrace five ultimate truths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what obstacles we face, what burdens we bear, what trials we’ve experienced, we can all be content with our present situation and optimistic about the future.</description>

  <description>Celebrity health expert and four-time &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, JJ Virgin reveals how one life-altering event taught her to tap into an indomitable mindset, trust her instincts, and defy the odds, ultimately saving her son’s life…and her own. She’ll share the lessons she learned that can help you create your own resilient mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, JJ Virgin was in a hospital room next to her sixteen-year-old son who was struck by a hit-and-run driver and left for dead. She was told by doctors that he wouldn’t last through the night and to let him go. With every reason to give up, JJ chose instead to invest her energy into the hope that her son would not just survive, but thrive. In &lt;i&gt;The Miracle Mindset&lt;/i&gt;, she shares the lessons that gave her the courage to overcome the worst moment of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this difficult time, she learned valuable personal lessons that helped her rebuild her life and find success and purpose in herself, her work, and teach her sons and community how to face their own obstacles and trials. Lessons like “Don’t Wish It Were Easier, Make Yourself Stronger” and “Your Limitations will Become Your Life” will lead you to your own personal power and purpose, even when the deck seems stacked against you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With true stories from her life, her clients, and other well-known thought leaders, she can help you transform your mindset and your daily habits to endure the difficult battles that life sends your way. Insightful, personal, and completely relatable, &lt;i&gt;The Miracle Mindset&lt;/i&gt; proves that miracles are possible when you show up, remain positive, and do the work.</description>

  <description>Patriarch Miss Kay, Korie, Missy, Jessica, and Lisa Robertson speak out about their roles in the crazy Robertson family and the core values that make this family work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &lt;i&gt;Duck Dynasty &lt;/i&gt;already know that the women behind the men with the beards know their own minds and know how and when to speak out to their men. But this insightful audiobook will give readers a look into what goes on behind the scenes and the real character and spunk of the women who love these bearded men. Listeners will find that the Duck Commander women have real depth and character and, in addition to being the perfect companions for the Duckmen, are strong women of substance in their own rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each section of this audiobook, our leading ladies share their hearts and their thoughts on the spiritual foundation that guides their lives as well as some of the difficulties and challenges they have faced in a chapter titled “‘Happily Ever After’ Sometimes Takes a While.” They share about how each one became a Robertson and challenge myths about their motives for marriage into this family. The wives of these beloved men share precious stories about their love for Phil and Kay—with chapters titled “Oh, Kay!” and “Getting Our Phil”—as well as the core values that govern their lives. You’ll learn about all their children, their own parents and grandparents, and what made them the women they are today.</description>

  <description>The #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; bestseller from Steve Case—the co-founder of AOL—presents “a compelling roadmap for the future…that can help us make sense of the technological changes reshaping our economy and the world. A fascinating read” (Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.org).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Case—a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life—was on the leading edge of a revolution in 1985 when he co-founded AOL, the first Internet company to go public and the most successful business of the 1990s. Back then Case was an entrepreneur in an industry that hadn’t really been invented yet, but he had a sense how dramatically the Internet would transform business and society. In &lt;i&gt;The Third Wave&lt;/i&gt;, he uses his insights garnered from nearly four decades of working as an innovator, investor, and businessman to argue the importance of entrepreneurship and to chart a path for future innovators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are entering, as Case explains, the “Third Wave” of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leveraged the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we’re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major “real world” sectors such as health, education, transportation, energy, and food—and in the process change the way we live our daily lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future, &lt;i&gt;The Third Wave&lt;/i&gt; explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies—and how all of us can make sense of this ever-changing digital age.</description>

When 13-year-old surfer Bethany Hamilton lost her arm in a shark attack, the media spotlight turned her quiet life upside down. Many wondered how this rising star would find the inner strength to press on and realize her pro surfing ambitions. Would she be able to adapt her surfing style to compete? Now, Bethany’s mother, Cheri, pulls back the curtain on her family’s life to show how the seeds of Bethany’s eventual triumph were planted decades before her birth, when Cheri and her future husband, Tom, were surf-loving kids searching for life’s meaning in the next big wave. &lt;i&gt;Raising a Soul Surfer&lt;/i&gt; follows their unpredictable journey across a continent to find each other and Jesus, and traces the hand of God at work in their lives as they married and started a family. Long before Bethany lost her arm and nearly her life, God was preparing the hearts and minds of her whole family to trust Him when it mattered most. The story of the Hamilton family, told as only a mother could, is a vivid illustration of how a sovereign God can turn what we see as a tragedy into a hope-filled witness of His power, grace and blessing.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Stewardship&lt;/i&gt; was a provocative, even revolutionary, book when the first edition was published twenty years ago, and it remains as relevant and radical today as it was then. We still face the challenge of fostering ownership and accountability throughout our organizations. Despite all the evidence calling for profound change, most organizations still rely on patriarchy and control as their core form of governance. The result is that they stifle initiative and spirit and alienate people from the work they do. This in the face of an increasing need to find ways to be responsive to customers and the wider community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Block insists that what is required is a dramatic shift in how we distribute power, privilege, and the control of money. “Stewardship,” he writes, “means giving people at the bottom and the boundaries of the organization choice over how to serve a customer, a citizen, a community. It is the willingness to be accountable for the well-being of the larger organization by operating in service, rather than in control, of those around us.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This audiobook edition has been fully revised and updated by Block, including a new introduction addressing what has changed—and what hasn’t—in the twenty years since the book was published and a new chapter on applying stewardship to the common good of the wider community. He covers both the theory of stewardship (in particular how it ameliorates the shortcomings of traditional leadership) and the practice (how it transforms every function and department for the better). And he offers tactical advice as well on gearing up to implement these reforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a foundational and far-reaching rethinking of leadership, power, purpose, governance, and participation in organizations and communities that the ideas of this audiobook will continue to open our minds and change our thinking for decades to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and renowned prosecuting attorney Robert K. Tanenbaum provides the first insider’s account of the historic Wylie-Hoffert case, from the shocking double-murder to the wrenching interrogation of an innocent young man, and the heroic Assistant District Attorney who risked everything to unravel a disgraceful injustice. Here is a gripping chronicle of the unnerving crime that led to the Miranda Rights, and of the courageous stand that forever reformed the American justice system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a muggy summer day in New York when Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert were raped and murdered in their apartment on Manhattan’s fashionable Upper East Side. Months passed as their families grieved the unthinkable and a shaken city awaited answers. Finally, Brooklyn police arrested George Whitmore, Jr., a nineteen-year-old with an I.Q. of less than 70. But his incarceration would ultimately entail a host of shocking law enforcement missteps and cover-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitmore had confessed. Yet Mel Glass, a young Manhattan Assistant D.A. not even assigned to the Homicide Bureau, was troubled by the investigation. With the blessing of legendary D.A. Frank Hogan, Glass tirelessly immersed himself in the case. So began an epic quest for justice, culminating in a courtroom showdown in which the Brooklyn arresting cops refused to admit their flagrant errors, providing a complete defense to a vicious predator. The outcome would reach far beyond the individuals involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including trial transcripts and never before published crime scene photos, here is a captivating depiction of one of the most intense manhunts of our time. &lt;i&gt;Echoes of My Soul&lt;/i&gt; is also a testament to the power of individuals like Glass and Hogan, without whom the real killer would never have been convicted and an unjustly accused man would have been jailed for life. And we may never have gained the legal safeguards that protect us today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The rags-to-riches story of a groundbreaking, beloved entertainer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When &lt;i&gt;The Flip Wilson Show&lt;/i&gt; debuted in 1970, black faces were still rare on television, black hosts nonexistent. So how did Clerow “Flip” Wilson go from Jersey City grade-school dropout to national celebrity, heralded on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; as “TV’s First Black Superstar”?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flip&lt;/i&gt; is a candid, entertaining biography of a consummate comedian who changed the face of American popular culture. Kevin Cook chronicles Flip’s meteoric rise through the Chitlin’ Circuit of segregated nightclubs to his breakthrough on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show to his hit variety show, on which he created such outrageous and hilarious characters as the sassy Geraldine and flock-fleecing Reverend Leroy. As one of the biggest stars of his time, he performed and partied with Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, and other stars of the 1970s.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Drawing on interviews with family, friends, and celebrities, Cook delivers the inspiring story of a complex man who broke the prime-time color barrier,  blazing a trail for generations of African American performers who followed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>For centuries people have been tormented by one question above all: If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain? And what of the suffering of animals, who neither deserve pain nor can be improved by it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest Christian thinker of our time sets out to disentangle this knotty issue. With his signature wealth of compassion and insight, C. S. Lewis offers answers to these crucial questions and shares his hope and wisdom to help heal a world hungry for a true understanding of human nature.</description>

  <description>At age thirty-five, Cami Walker was burdened by a battle with multiple sclerosis, a chronic neurological condition that made it difficult for her to walk, work, or enjoy her life. Seeking a remedy for her depression after being hospitalized, she received an uncommon prescription from an African medicine woman: &lt;i&gt;Give to others for 29 days&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;29 Gifts&lt;/i&gt; is the insightful story of the author's life change as she embraces and reflects on the naturally reciprocal process of giving and receiving. Many of Walker's gifts were simple —a phone call, spare change, a Kleenex. Yet the acts were transformative. By Day 29, not only had Walker's health and happiness improved, but she had created a worldwide giving movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book also includes personal essays from others whose lives changed for the better by giving, plus pages for the reader to record their own journey. More than a memoir, &lt;i&gt;29 Gifts&lt;/i&gt; offers inspiring lessons on how a simple daily practice of altruism can dramatically alter your outlook on the world.</description>

  <description>Finally, the war between science and religion is over. The winner? All of us. With supporters from an incredibly wide spectrum of backgrounds and beliefs, including five Nobel laureates, &lt;i&gt;Thank God for Evolution&lt;/i&gt;! builds bridges, provides guidance, and restores realistic hope for humanity and the body of life as a whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A movement has been growing over the past few decades that takes our common creation story -- the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution revealed by science -- as the basis for a meaningful view of our place in the universe. Reverend Michael Dowd, America's evolutionary evangelist, is at the forefront of this movement. This well informed, thoroughly researched, and inspired book proclaims a gospel billions of years old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank God for Evolution&lt;/i&gt;! presents in a lively and accessible manner the reasons why it is now possible to view evolution as a divine process; how current science shows that evolution is not meaningless blind chance; practical methods for using evolutionary insights to achieve greater personal fulfillment and thriving relationships; and how aligning with evolutionary trends can guide activists and others hoping to make our world a better place. As a Christian minister, Dowd especially addresses the concerns that Christians have about evolution, but this book contains insights that will appeal to people of all faiths and of no faith. Fun and uplifting, Thank God for Evolution! goes beyond the current debate to offer up a whole new way of thinking about science, religion, and the meaning and purpose of our lives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In today's fast-moving Information Age, traditional business-planning tools are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet the competitive, ever-changing marketplace demands that executives move quickly or risk becoming relics. In Three Moves Ahead, business leader and chess expert Bob Rice offers an entertaining, practical response to this modern dilemma. He shows how the world's top executives use chess tactics to thrive in the face of incalculable complexities and unexpected change. Written for nonplayers, this witty, smart guide is filled with real-world examples of how to win the game of business by applying chess strategies honed from over 1,000 years of competition. With incisive prose, Rice clearly shows how to use these principles to attack competitors, defend turf, and crack new markets. He demonstrates how a ?Strong Square? strategy drove Adobe's rise from niche player to industry powerhouse, how Kodak is reviving its fortunes with an ?Exchange Sacrifice, ? and how Google is creating holes in Microsoft's position with a ?Minority Attack.? Most importantly, Three Moves Ahead also shows how to ?Stay Ahead On the Clock? and avoid the fate of companies like Polaroid, Gateway, and our dearly departed Ma Bell.</description>

  <description>Radio and television host Glenn Beck has experienced the rollercoaster of life like few others.  From the suicide of his mother when he was just thirteen, to his eventual alcoholism, depression, divorce, unemployment, and health scares—Glenn has weathered life’s darkest storms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any one of those struggles could’ve ruined him, yet Glenn was able to keep moving forward.  He saw past the darkness into the light; past his grief and addictions and into what his life &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU CAN DO IT TOO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of finding happiness through personal redemption was not easy, but it left Glenn with a blueprint for how to confront future adversity.  Glenn is living proof that these steps—he calls them &lt;i&gt;wonders&lt;/i&gt;—don’t just work on paper.  They helped transform his life and can they can help to transform yours as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE 7 WONDERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenn Beck and Dr. Keith Ablow—two of the most popular and influential personalities in American media today—have joined forces to present a powerful guide to personal transformation and fulfillment that is as unique as their own unlikely partnership.  They are called the “7 Wonders” and they can be used by anyone who has made the decision that they are ready to change their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the television talk show host and the bestselling psychiatrist struck up a fast friendship they realized that their experiences with life’s struggles were complementary.  What Keith had studied, Glenn had lived.  What Keith had counseled patients on for years, Glenn had suffered through for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeply personal insights they shared brought them to realize that their life stories had seven key principles in common; seven wonders that seemed to be essential ingredients for anyone attempting to transform their life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where does the courage to persevere come from when everything seems hopeless? Why is it nearly impossible to succeed without faith?  How much do family and friendships matter in our journey? How do we break down our walls and reveal our inner truths? What does having compassion &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; mean? How do you tell &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; friends apart from those who are holding you back? If there’s no one to blame for my past, what do you do with your anger and resentment? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kinds of questions are the starting point toward fundamentally changing how you view past damaging relationships, toward breaking the debilitating grip of addiction and depression, toward injecting life with new meaning and purpose and toward helping you embark on a new journey based on hope, strength, and personal empowerment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you unwrap each of the seven wonders for yourself, you’ll discover exactly what Glenn Beck found as he transformed his own life from darkness to light, from dead ends to endless possibilities, from addiction to freedom: it doesn’t take a superhero to find the strength to change—it just takes the courage to take the first step.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, which was only possible by combining together decades of personal struggle with world-class professional experience, can be that first step for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 7 Wonders&lt;/i&gt; grows out of a unique friendship that we’ve developed over the last five-years.&lt;/b&gt; It is unique because it brought together a psychiatrist who naturally burrows toward the truth, and a recovering addict who spent decades running from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we spent more time together we began to let our guards down.  Over time we reached a level of honesty with each other that is rare.  As a result, we learned that the principles that have guided the well-honed healing techniques of one of us are precisely the same principles that &lt;i&gt;instinctively&lt;/i&gt; guided the other to replace nearly unbearable pain with genuine happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We believe that it was God’s plan for us to meet; that it was God’s plan for us to speak so openly with one another; and it was God’s plan that we share with you the seven wonders we discovered together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also firmly believe that it was God’s plan that this book now finds you at this exact moment in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; —Glenn Beck &amp;amp; Dr. Keith Ablow</description>

  <description>Ever since Eve asked Adam, "Do I look fat in this fig leaf?" it has been apparent that husbands don't know how to relate to their wives. Men believe they understand women and vice versa, but really men know as much about women as a cocker spaniel knows about assembling a Weber grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Happy Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, Steve Doocy's laugh-out-loud perspective on love, marriage, and family. The book can be used for its hilarious husband and wife wisdom or, if things aren't going well, as a projectile to get somebody's attention. This is not an advice book. It is a don't even think of trying this book. The author, his family, and his collection of friends (some very famous in the worlds of entertainment, business, and politics) have already discreetly made almost every conceivable marriage mistake, and it is their hope that this irrev- erent manual can save you the trouble of being an idiot on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doocy, co-host of &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt;, who has been married for twenty consecutive years, provides real slice-of-life stories on everything from early marriage ("I love you, you're perfect, now wear this thong") and pregnancy ("You're eating for two? Who— you and Shaquille O'Neal?") to sending your child to college ("Is that a funnel?") and retirement (high-fiber appetizers on Viagra dates). Most of the stories conclude with "corrections" and additional wise words from Doocy's real-life wife, Kathy, who, after two decades of picking up Steve's socks in the garage, has developed a zany sense of humor herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a handy troubleshooting section for when things go haywire, like during the eye- opening experiment undertaken especially for this book, wherein the author wanted to prove to his wife that they were perfect for each other, so he had them join an on-line dating service. Out of a database of several hundred thousand guys, he was not in her top 532 &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; men. Despite the fact that their one- month experiment ended a year ago, she's still getting photographs of single men whose head shots appear to have been taken at a recent skinhead convention. Luckily for him, she still prefers "bonehead to skinhead."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a celebration of the pageantry that is wedlock, which starts with an "I do" and sometimes ends with a boiled rabbit. Let's face it, marriage isn't always as smooth as a forty-year-old's forehead after six months of Botox. In fact, marriage is ridiculously hard, but laughing about it is now incredibly easy with &lt;em&gt;The Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Happy Handbook&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>In 2003, Pat Tillman, serving in the US Army, hastily wrote a "just in case" letter to his wife, Marie. When he returned on leave before his departure to Afghanistan, he placed the letter on top of their bedroom dresser. For months it sat there, sealed and ever–present, like a black hole through which Marie knew her stable life would be pulled if she ever had reason to open it. Then, in April 2004, Marie's worst nightmare came true. In the days following his death, it was Pat's letter that kept her going and, more than that, it was his words that would help her learn to navigate a world she could no longer share with her husband. In &lt;i&gt;The Letter&lt;/i&gt;, Marie's talks for the first time about her journey to remake her life after Pat's death. In it, she recalls meeting and falling in love with Pat when they were kids, his harrowing decision to join the army after 9/11, and the devastating day when she learned he'd been killed. She describes how she withdrew from the public spotlight to grieve, learning along the way the value of solitude, self–awareness and integrity in the healing process. And, finally, Marie recounts her work to rebuild her life, including founding The Pat Tillman Foundation, an organization established to carry forth Pat's legacy of leadership, and her decision to step back into the public eye in order to inspire people to live with meaning and purpose. Filled with the lessons Marie learned and the wisdom she gained since Pat's death, &lt;i&gt;The Letter &lt;/i&gt;is both a heartrending love story and an inspiring tale for anyone, young or old, whose life has taken an unexpected hard turn—and who struggles to get back on the right path.</description>

  <description>Texas may well be America’s most controversial state. Evangelicals dominate the halls of power, millions of its people live in poverty, and its death row is the busiest in the country. Skeptical outsiders have found much to be offended by in the state’s politics and attitude. And yet, according to journalist (and Texan) Erica Grieder, the United States has a great deal to learn from Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Big, Hot, Cheap, and Right&lt;/i&gt;, Grieder traces the political history of a state that was always larger than life. From its rowdy beginnings, Texas has combined a long-standing suspicion of government intrusion with a passion for business. Looking to the present, Greider assesses the unique mix of policies on issues like immigration, debt, taxes, regulation, and energy, which together have sparked a bonafide Texas Miracle of job growth. While acknowledging that it still has plenty of twenty-first-century problems to face, she finds in Texas a model of governance whose power has been drastically underestimated. Her book is a fascinating exploration of America’s underrated powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This memoir by Dan Rather -- one of the most pre-eminent journalists of our time -- is told in a straightforward and conversational manner so that you hear his distinctive voice on every page. Rather, -- who has won every prestigious journalism award in his distinguished career -- discusses all the big stories from his decades of reporting. This very personal accounting includes (but is certainly not limited to) his dismissal from CBS, the Abu Ghraib story, the George W. Bush Air National Guard controversy, his coverage of the JFK assassination, the origin of "Hurricane Dan" as well as inside stories about all the top personalities Dan has either interviewed or worked with over his remarkable career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audiobook will also include Dan's thoughts and reflections on the state of journalism today and what he sees for its future, as well as never-before-revealed personal observations and commentary.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling novelist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Invention of Solitude&lt;/i&gt;, a moving and highly personal meditation on the body, time, and language itself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;That is where the story begins, in your body, and everything will end in the body as well.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing his sixty-third winter, internationally acclaimed novelist Paul Auster sits down to write a history of his body and its sensations—both pleasurable and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years after the publication of &lt;i&gt;The Invention of Solitude&lt;/i&gt;, in which he wrote so movingly about fatherhood, Auster gives us a second unconventional memoir in which he writes about his mother's life and death. &lt;i&gt;Winter Journal&lt;/i&gt; is a highly personal meditation on the body, time, and memory, by one of our most intellectually elegant writers.</description>

  <description>The life story of Ishi, the last Yahi Indian, lone survivor of an exterminated tribe, is unique in the annals of North American anthropology. Ishi stumbled into the twentieth century on the morning of August 29, 1911, when, desperate with hunger and terrified of the white murderers of his family, he was found in the corral of a slaughterhouse near Oroville, California. Finally identified as a Yahi by an anthropologist, Ishi was brought to San Francisco by Professor T. T. Waterman and lived there the rest of his life under the care and protection of Alfred Kroeber and the staff of the University of California's Museum of Anthropology.</description>

  <description>"This work offers wonderful wisdom for navigating the inflection points in our lives." - Mehmet Oz, MD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An iconic teacher. A warm friend. A generous mentor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than 40 years, Howard Stevenson has been a towering figure at Harvard Business School: the man who literally defined entrepreneurship and taught thousands of the world's most successful professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - spurred by Stevenson's heart-stopping brush with death - his student, colleague, and dear friend Eric Sinoway shares the man's wisdom and inspiration. Through warm and engaging conversations, we hear Howard's timeless and practical lessons on pursuing success and fulfillment, beginning with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Create a vision of your own legacy through a process called "business planning for life."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be entrepreneurial in driving your career ahead (even if you're not an entrepreneur).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Exploit the inflection points in your life - whether "friend," "foe," or "silent."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cut risk in tough career and life decisions by shining the "light of predictability" on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Plan for the ripples, not just the splash from your actions and choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to Howard's Gift is like having a wise, caring friend sit down and say, "Let's figure all this out together." &lt;br /&gt;"This book is truly a gift for all those seeking fulfilling careers." - Wendy Kopp, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Teach For America</description>

  <description>On my third tour of duty in Iraq as F -16 fighter pilot, I felt a powerful calling from God to share the miraculous fusion of people and experiences uniquely placed along my journey. During my reflection, I began to understand how the forces of synchronicity had shaped my life. Synchronicity, or, as I like to call it, "chance with a purpose," is all around us. These encounters with God's messengers are the sign-posts along the road of life guiding us toward our essence. We are here for a reason, each with a destined path. Our life's purpose lies in the realm between fear and faith. It is the ultimate reward for those that venture to the edges of life. This is my path - A PATRIOT'S CALLING</description>

  <description>After her plane crashes, a seventeen-year-old girl spends eleven days walking through the Peruvian jungle. Against all odds, with no food, shelter, or equipment, she gets out. A better-equipped group of adult survivors of the same crash sits down and dies. What makes the difference? Examining such stories of miraculous endurance and tragic death--how people get into trouble and how they get out again (or not)--Deep Survival takes us from the tops of snowy mountains and the depths of oceans to the workings of the brain that control our behavior. Through close analysis of case studies, Laurence Gonzales describes the "stages of survival" and reveals the essence of a survivor--truths that apply not only to surviving in the wild but also to surviving life-threatening illness, relationships, the death of a loved one, running a business during uncertain times, and even war. In the end, he finds, it is what's in your heart, not what's in your pack, that separates the living from the dead. Fascinating and absolutely essential for anyone who hikes in the woods, this book will change the way we understand ourselves and the great outdoors.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This father of ten thriving children delivers knock-out advice on the art of being a dad.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Foreman is an international symbol of a positive attitude, determination, and athleticism. He's also well known for having ten children, five boys and five girls. As a man who strives to live in obedience to the Ultimate Father, Foreman has a powerful perspective on effective, godly fatherhood. Through his own experiences as a son in a single-parent home, as a faithful father, and now as a grandfather, he knows what works and what doesn't--all with a dose of humor and humility. The goal of this book is to provide commonsense fathering advice and anecdotes to a wide variety of men who themselves are encountering the challenges of fatherhood.</description>

  <description>Read by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "New York Times" bestselling author of "Nickel and Dimed" returns with a powerful memoir of her quest, beginning in childhood, to discover the truth about the universe and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In middle age, Barbara Ehrenreich came across the journal she had kept during her tumultuous adolescence and set out to reconstruct that quest, which had taken her to the study of science and through a cataclysmic series of uncanny or as she later learned to call them, mystical experiences. A staunch atheist and rationalist, she is profoundly shaken by the implications of her lifelong search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part memoir, part philosophical and spiritual inquiry, "Living with a Wild God" brings an older woman s wry and erudite perspective to a young girl s uninhibited musings on the questions that, at one point or another, torment us all. Certain to be a classic, "Living with a Wild God" combines intellectual rigor with a frank account of the inexplicable, in Ehrenreich s singular voice, to produce a true literary achievement.</description>
