  <description>A painfully awkward love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incomprehensibly awkward Elizabeth Wilde is desperate for love. Connection. Intimacy. After a lifetime of romantic failures, the twenty-one-year-old gamer realizes she needs help. Professional help. She needs…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sex tutor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The devastatingly hot jock Austin Jacobs is just the man for the job. As the reigning campus sex god, he has the playboy act down pat. But underneath those six-pack abs beats a broken heart. He doesn’t trust people and he sure as hell doesn’t believe in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd couple strike a deal. Four weeks of ‘tutoring’ for five thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Austin coaxes Elizabeth out from behind her computer screen, the attraction they feel is undeniable. They’re both a little broken, but somehow their jagged edges fit. And when their world comes tumbling down on top of them, they each have to decide if this weird thing called love is worth fighting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader advisory: This book includes references to inadequate parenting, parental death, a parent with addiction. There are also scenes including the use of performance drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 24th December 2019</description>

      <![CDATA[Was lucky enough to read an early version of this and ADORED it! So excited to see it being out and available for others to read! It reminded me of a few other romances I'd read this year, but this one always stuck in my head as I read those others. Great book!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Listening time 2 hours 32 minutes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single dad and hockey star, Calder Weiss has put his love life on the back burner for the past five years, raising his daughter and keeping up with the demands of his profession. But all that changes the minute Rachel Perry runs into him in the most unlikely of places, right outside the men's bathroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant and enchanting, she captures his attention, making it impossible for him to walk away without scoring her number. Their connection is immediate, their attraction palpable, and their relationship undeniable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rachel isn't the only girl in Calder's life, which scares him, because Calder's daughter already lost her mother. He doesn't want Shea to lose someone close to her again, making Rachel's task of breaking through Calder's wall that much more difficult.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Dear Jerk Across the Street, sorry for accidentally walking in on you and catching an eyeful of your--equipment. And hard pass on the open invitation to join you in the shower "anytime", A-hole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the note I should've written. Instead I sent a pleasant and apologetic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known Phoenix "Nix" Russo would've been the neighbor from hell, I'd have told him right where he could shove my words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nix is the big man on campus with everyone lined up at his games to make sure he knows it. Sure, he's got piercing blue eyes, abs that don't quit and a smile that could set fire to a set of panties from a hundred yards away, but he's also the biggest pain in my ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Pink-Haired Menace, learn how to take a joke and stop being such a kill-joy...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Masterson called the cops on one of my parties--again. My sweet talking usually gets me out of trouble, but this time it got me into a nice pair of silver handcuffs. Now I'm on a reputation rehab tour with a stop at a spring break community service project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess who's my new boss?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we're shoulder to shoulder, sweaty, tired and...she's not anything like I expected. There might just be a heart under that hardass exterior. She's invading my dreams and I can't shake the feeling she's the key to unlocking a piece of me that I've hidden away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's only a matter of time until she finds out why I'm really here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can break through her walls and into her heart before that happens...one screw at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;em&gt;The Second We Met&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;standalone&lt;/strong&gt; new adult romance**</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Rian Thompson thought she joined the gym to get healthy. Little did she know she was about to add hundred and ninety pounds of swoonworthy abdominal muscles and arrogance to her life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day in Rians’s life follows a predictable pattern, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. She’s got a nice job, a nice place to live, and a nice family – even if they are a little wedding-zilla-ish at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t need anything spectacular to be happy. She just needs to get healthy – mentally, physically. . . and maybe spiritually if that happens. But she’ll settle for two out of three until her sister finally gets hitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carlos Davies thought his life was perfect. Little did he know it was about to be turned upside down by a woman who is not his type.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Carlos’s mind, his life is damn near perfect. He’s got a great job, a great place to live, and a great stash of pick up lines that always work. It has occurred to him that maybe no one actually takes him all that seriously. But with these bulging biceps and thick, dark hair, does that even matter since he’s never sleeping alone?&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Weight Expectations, where great—and unexpected—things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Weight Expectations' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Cipher Office series, Knitting in the City World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A man of few words, Ranger Jay Daniels values the calm, quiet solitude of the Great Smoky Mountains. Never quite fitting in with either side of his family, he prefers the company of birds and tress to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, he'd most definitely prefer a bird--any bird, any bird at all, take a vulture for instance--to the human-tornado hybrid that just blew onto his peaceful stretch of the Appalachian Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path of true love never has run smooth for Olive Perry. After getting dumped and promptly abandoned in the middle of her multi-month hike, Olive swears off men. Determined to finish the long trek by herself, she doesn't need a prince--or broody and taciturn ranger--to save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, when an early snowstorm threatens the mountains, and Ranger Daniels is charged with getting hikers to safety, that includes hot-tempered Olive Perry. Snowed in and forced to share an abandoned cabin, can Olive's heated intensity melt Jay's cool reserve?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if so, will this happy trail lead to true love? Or will their time together be just another bump in the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Happy Trail' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Park Ranger series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The storm of the century is about to hit Little Bridge Island, Florida—and it’s sending waves crashing through Sabrina “Bree” Beckham’s love life…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a massive hurricane severs all power and cell service to Little Bridge Island — as well as its connection to the mainland — twenty-five-year-old Bree Beckham isn’t worried... at first. She’s already escaped one storm — her emotionally abusive ex — so a hurricane seems like it will be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But animal-loving Bree does become alarmed when she realizes how many islanders have been cut off from their beloved pets. Now it’s up to her to save as many of Little Bridge’s cats and dogs as she can... but to do so, she’s going to need help — help she has no choice but to accept from her boss’s sexy nephew, Drew Hartwell, the Mermaid Café’s most notorious heartbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Bree starts falling for Drew, just as Little Bridge’s power is restored and her penitent ex shows up, she has to ask herself if her island fling was only a result of the stormy weather, or if it could last during clear skies too.</description>

  <description>How do you know if a risk is worth taking? If you knew, there wouldn’t be any risk.&lt;br /&gt;Following a disastrous appearance on a televised baking show, Sophie Copeland is certain things can’t get any worse. Several calamities later, Sophie finds herself in Green Valley, Tennessee with no plan, no place to stay, and no prospects. But at least she has a temporary seasonal arrangement with the famed Donner Bakery. And that's something, right?&lt;br /&gt;It's not permanent, and it's not a home, but it's still something.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Joel Barnes, a Green Valley mystery, wrapped in rumors, and a whispered connection to the local notorious biker gang. Joel’s got a name for being bad news, but he also has an apartment for rent.&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by the dichotomy of Joel’s reputation and sexy southern pull, Sophie can’t help but be tempted, even though she knows—given her (bad) luck—she should stay far, far away. . . &lt;br /&gt;Yet as everyone knows, without risk, there’s no reward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'No Whisk, No Reward' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#3 in the Donner Bakery series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 6 hours and 15 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowritten by USA Today best-selling author Tara Sivec and award-winning narrator Andi Arndt, a hysterically funny, heartfelt romance about starting over and taking chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing good ever comes from drinking a box of wine alone. So when I decided to entertain my drunken self by setting up some hand-me-down podcasting equipment and reading the steamy parts from romance novels, I never thought anyone would actually listen. The fact that I admitted my huge crush on my sexy next door neighbor made the whole thing even more mortifying. But sometimes life surprises you, and that’s how my podcast, Heidi’s Discount Erotica, was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I, Heidi Larsen, a sweet former kindergarten teacher in Waconia, Minnesota, lead a scandalous double life reading erotic novels to the listening world. And with each episode, I find myself embracing my new alter ego more and more. Now I’m starting to feel more comfortable in my own skin and do things I never would have dreamed of - like kissing my neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look out, Waconia, because Heidi’s on the loose! She’s in your ears, in your hearts, and down your pants...wait, that didn’t sound as good as it did in my head. Well, you get the picture, don’tcha know!</description>

  <description>Working at Bliss Lingerie, Sarah Harrison deals with all sorts of—interesting clientele. Yet no one sparks her interest more than Jared Gaines, the ultra-rich, ultra-sexy businessman who frequents her shop, buying delicate little “gifts” for the women in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day, Jared sends her a gift from Bliss. And when Sarah walks into his office, demanding to know why, he makes her an offer she somehow can’t refuse—be his fake girlfriend for the weekend while attending his brother’s engagement party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing Sarah knows, she’s in San Francisco, pretending to be in love with Jared. Not that it’s a hardship. Once you get the man away from the office, he’s much more relaxed. Sweet. Funny. Even… thoughtful? Oh, and sexier than ever, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their pretend relationship turns very real, very quickly. Soon Sarah’s in over her head. Could what she and Jared share turn into something real? Or is it all actually… fake?</description>

And the chemistry between Sarah and Jared was hot. Both families were really good ones, and I enjoyed their parts...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WANTED: ROOMMATE. Must be tidy, polite, and absolutely not my brother's hot as sin best friend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I'd had one too many wines. Maybe I'd done it accidentally. Maybe I'd been sleep-texting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I know for sure is this: I absolutely do not want Ethan Hawkins in my apartment, up in my business, taking over my space.&lt;br /&gt;Yet he's here. Moving his stuff into my spare bedroom. Sending a wave of panty-melting, musky man-scent my way every time he walks past me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the thing.&lt;br /&gt;We don't get along--at all. We never have, and I don't think we're going to start now that we're under one roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also that little issue where I'm kinda, sorta, totally in love with him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uh-oh.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>What do a wrong number text, a burning building, and a quirky florist have in common? &lt;br /&gt;A hunky firefighter with an extra-large…hosepipe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I never should have opened that text message. The last thing I needed first thing on a Monday was a picture of some stranger’s, um, eggplant, in my inbox. &lt;br /&gt;I also should have replaced the batteries in my fire alarm, because my Friday night did not need to end with my apartment building going up in flames. &lt;br /&gt;But it’s fine. It’s fine. Everything is fine. &lt;br /&gt;I’m only lying in a hospital bed with more split ends than I’ve ever had, almost all my Earthly possessions have turned to ash, and apparently, they don’t serve wine to patients in this place. &lt;br /&gt;But like I said, it’s fine. &lt;br /&gt;Until he walks in. &lt;br /&gt;The guy who saved my life. My hero. Noah Jacobs. &lt;br /&gt;And the universe is amusing itself at my expense, because the dirty photo I woke up to on Monday? &lt;br /&gt;It’s his.</description>

  <description>By day, seventeen-year-old Kiera Johnson is an honors student, a math tutor, and one of the only Black kids at Jefferson Academy. But at home, she joins hundreds of thousands of Black gamers who duel worldwide as Nubian personas in the secret multiplayer online role-playing card game, SLAY. No one knows Kiera is the game developer, not her friends, her family, not even her boyfriend, Malcolm, who believes video games are partially responsible for the "downfall of the Black man."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a teen in Kansas City is murdered over a dispute in the SLAY world, news of the game reaches mainstream media, and SLAY is labeled a racist, exclusionist, violent hub for thugs and criminals. Even worse, an anonymous troll infiltrates the game, threatening to sue Kiera for "anti-white discrimination."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven to save the only world in which she can be herself, Kiera must preserve her secret identity and harness what it means to be unapologetically Black in a world intimidated by Blackness. But can she protect her game without losing herself in the process?</description>

  <description>EAT. SLEEP. FOOTBALL. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those are Jackson Jennings, Jr’s three mantras . His entire life, he’s been a trained athlete with only one end-game: the Pro’s. No girls. No parties. No alcohol. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;EAT. SLEEP. FOOTBALL. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Repeat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every Friday night, Triple J cruises the strip on campus, bored, lonely and conditioned not to party. But the night he meets Charlotte Edmonds on the side of the road, he wonders if his three mantras will ever be enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BIG. DUMB. JOCK. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlie has no time for Jackson’s antics. Not when he’s stealing her food or teases her to no end, making her tingle in all the right places. But if she’s ever going to have a boyfriend, she’d choose one who isn’t a Neanderthal. One with manners and actual time to spend with her. Not a hulking man-child who cruises the strip at night, in his Big. Dumb. Truck.</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 6 hours and 57 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Program Type: Audiobook&lt;br /&gt;Version: Unabridged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A magnificent new romance by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Emma Chase - available in audio first!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean Walker is all about keeping life simple. He's effortlessly talented and intelligent - spending his summers playing drums in the local band and the rest of the year teaching high school in the same Jersey town where he grew up. He likes his love life simple too, enjoying the commitment-free hook-ups his good looks and sexy charm have always made oh so easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he meets Lainey Burrows. And his simple, easy life gets turned upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wild one-night stand was all it was ever supposed to be, so Lainey is shocked when she discovers that her sizzling summer fling is also her son's new math teacher. But that's nothing compared to the most unexpected twist of all - their hot hook-up left Lainey knocked up, and now they're about to become parents. Together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ensues is an addictive, insatiable, sweet and tender romance that won't be simple, but it will be more than worth the fight.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;When Elephants Fly&lt;/i&gt; comes an exceptional new novel about falling down, risking everything and embracing what makes us unique. Don't miss this compulsively readable novel about the most unlikely of heroes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger "Danny" Danielle Warren is no stranger to falling. After losing an eye in a childhood accident, she had to relearn her perception of movement and space. Now Danny keeps her head down, studies hard, and works to fulfill everyone else's needs. She's certain that her mom's bitterness and her TV star father's absence are her fault. If only she were &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;-more athletic, charismatic, attractive-life would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her dad calls with an offer to join him to film the next episode of his popular survivalist show, Danny jumps at the chance to prove she's not the disappointment he left behind. Being on set with the hottest teen movie idol of the moment, Gus Price, should be the cherry on top. But when their small plane crashes in the Amazon, and a terrible secret is revealed, Danny must face the truth about the parent she worships and falling for Gus, and find her own inner strength and worth to light the way home.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Don’t touch the nanny. It’s one rule I’m most certainly going to break.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since becoming a single father, I have two things that keep me sane—my daughter Lily and playing football for the NFL. But when my meddling sister hires a nanny without my knowledge, I’m not thrilled to come home and find the woman has taken over my house. Our instant attraction is one more complication I don’t need in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my daughter loves Amelia, and I will do anything for that tiny munchkin. Even if it means walking around with blue balls most of the time. Why does the &lt;i&gt;nanny&lt;/i&gt; have to be so sweet—and drop dead gorgeous? She’s driving me crazy. Never in my life have I wanted a woman more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to make it through this season. I can do that. Hands free, of course. But then there’s that moment, and I know she’s thinking what I’m thinking and, well, yeah. Screw the rules...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author K. Bromberg comes the raw, sexy, and jaw-dropping finale to the Wicked Ways series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I play to win, and I won’t let anything—or anyone—get in the way of what I want.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I met Vaughn Sanders, I knew I wanted her. Confident, intelligent, and downright sexy. I thought I knew how to play her game. I was ready and willing for the challenge. Little did I know she was full of secrets and surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But so am I.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming a woman into my bed has never been my problem. It’s the relationship part that is. They want it. I don’t. But can you blame me? Broken marriages are how I make a living. Hell, no self-respecting man would let a woman own his thoughts, invade his dreams, and steal his heart. So how in the world has Vaughn done that to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve fallen in love with her.&lt;/i&gt; There. I said it. But that acknowledgment comes with a heavy price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything and everyone seem to be working against us, leaving us both to question whether what we have is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll be damned if I go down without a fight.</description>

  <description>Nothing about being a librarian prepared Thuy Nguyen for such a wide variety of casseroles. Or life in a small town. Or becoming a farmer.&lt;br /&gt;But what can she do when her catastrophe-prone best friend begs her for help? After all, Maddy has always been there for Thuy. It’s time to return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;It’s simple really, all she has to do is: learn everything about farming ASAP, save her BBF’s family business from disaster, and avoid being caught staring at Maddy’s biker brother, and his muscles, and his smile, and his soulful, sexy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and she should definitely not fall in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;Easy, right? . . . Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Prose Before Bros' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#3 in the Green Valley Library series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

The single dad can’t seem to shake thoughts of shy Sabrina. Without quite understanding the impulse, Wyatt makes his mission finding her again, so he can . . . well, he’ll just have to reckon with that later.&lt;br /&gt;What Wyatt discovers is a woman who trusts too easily, but who’s afraid to live. Trust doesn’t come easily to Wyatt. But living? That’s never been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;And he’d sure like to show her how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Crime and Periodicals' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book #2 in the Green Valley Library series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Naomi Winters will be forty--soon-ish--and she's only been with one man. One night. One time. Long ago. She believes everything happens for a reason, and the universe spoke about Nathan Ryder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Ryder isn't the same man who hightailed his bike out of Green Valley eighteen years ago. As a rule breaker, women are one area he acts a fool. Case in point...the local librarian. He can't get a read on her, but she's one risk he's willing to take. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do an eccentric librarian and a sexy silver biker have in common? More than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The due date on their love might not be expired after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Love in Due Time' is a full-length, contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Green Valley Library series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I'm Levi Buchanan, and until five years ago, I thought the legend of my family's curse was a load of crazy, Southern nonsense.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No curse can make you fall in love at first sight. No curse can force a true, deep, passionate, all-consuming love that will haunt you all the days of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met Jocelyn Abernathy and I realized how completely wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Jocelyn guards her feelings like well-armed soldier. She's the most beautiful, stubborn, infuriating woman I've ever met. Every time she talks, I want to kiss the living daylights out of her. But I can't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because when we met, she didn't need true love. She needed a best friend. And that's what I've been to her... for five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jocelyn meets a handsome stranger her first day working at Donner Bakery and she lets him buy her a dill pickle cupcake, I realize with ominous regret that I may have missed my window with my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;If I can't get her to see past our friendship, my new curse may be to watch the love of my life move on with someone else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;'Baking Me Crazy' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Donner Bakery series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>He’s a hockey star with a headboard full of notches. She’s a shy NHL concession worker at who’s never been kissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lindy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don’t call me Belinda Boring for nothing. It’s my name, after all. And for a 23-year-old with plain brown hair who still lives at home and gets tongue tied over nothing, it’s a fitting one. I’m not even one of those quiet girls with a hidden talent, unless making a mean order of nachos at the NHL arena I work at counts. My life consists of working, reading and harboring a secret crush on a hockey player who doesn’t know I exist. At least, until we accidentally meet and become unlikely friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m living the dream. A poor kid who worked his way into the NHL, I’ll never forget where I came from, though I try to. My past follows me, a nagging reminder that I’ll never be what everyone thinks I am. As the threat of my secret being exposed looms closer, my game slips, leaving me in danger of being cut from my team--the only family I have. I’m losing my hold on everything when a new friend helps me find hope. She’s nothing like the women I’m used to, but by the time I figure out that’s exactly why she’s right for me, I’ve lost my chance with her. Somehow, I have to convince a woman who thinks she’s invisible that she’s the only one I see.</description>

  <description>Falling for my brother’s best friend is not an option—right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenzie Hill needs a place to stay the summer before college, so when a spot opens up at her brother Aaron’s ‘baseball’ house, she accepts. Living with a bunch of dudes who walk around shirtless won’t distract her—she has plans and nothing will get in her way. Not even her brother’s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanner Johnson has one thing on his mind—his future in the MLB. After choosing to wait another year before entering the draft, he now dedicates every second to getting better on the field, or letting loose. His best friend’s sister shouldn’t even register on his radar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first kiss is an accident and the second leads to more. They agree it’ll just be a fling and that Aaron can never know. Kenzie’s just starting her future, while Tanner’s is already planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling for her brother’s best friend was never an option—but what happens when suddenly, it is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader advisory: This book contains scenes of underage characters drinking. There are abusive and absent parents and a parent with cancer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 6th August 2019</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;12 hrs 23 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York’s Finest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogging as *The Socialmedialite*&lt;br /&gt;April 22&lt;br /&gt;LADIES AND GENTS! I have an announcement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that guy I featured on my blog a few months ago? The really, really hot Irish rugby player who plays the position of ‘hooker’ in the RLI (Rugby League International)? The one with the anger management issues, the body of a gladiator and the face of a movie star? The one with the questionable fashion choices leading me to ask whether he was the lovechild of a leprechaun and a hobbit? Ronan Fitzpatrick? Yeah, that guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have a confession to make…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HERMIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Catrel, social media expert extraordinaire at Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media and clandestine celebrity blogger, can make anyone shine in the court of public opinion. She is the Socialmedialite, anonymous creator of New York’s Finest and the internet’s darling. Virtual reality is Annie’s forte, but actual reality? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HOOKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronan Fitzpatrick, aka the best hooker the world of rugby has seen in decades, despises the media—social or otherwise. The press has spun a web of lies depicting him as rugby’s wild and reckless bad boy. Suspended from his team, Ronan has come to Manhattan to escape the drama, lay low, fly under the radar. Only, Ronan isn’t easy to overlook, and he can’t escape the notice of the Socialmedialite…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PLAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ronan is sent to Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media to reshape his public image, he never expects to cross paths with shy but beautiful Annie, nor does he expect his fierce attraction to her. He couldn’t be happier when her boss suggests pairing them together. &lt;br /&gt;What lengths will Annie take to keep her virtual identity concealed? And what happens when the hooker discovers who the hermit really is? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hooker and the Hermit is a collaboration between authors L.H. Cosway and Penny Reid, is a full length 100k word novel, and is a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Callie Canter knows all about screwing up--&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; being screwed over. After her so-called boyfriend publicly humiliated her senior year, taking a fifth year of high school at Beaufort Hills Academy is her second chance to leave behind a painful past. But her need for social acceptance follows, and going along with the in-crowd is the difference between survival and becoming a target. Staying off the radar is top priority. So, falling for an outsider is the last thing on Callie's "to-do" list. Too bad her heart didn't get the memo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his strict, religious upbringing and former identity far away in Florida, Jayden Morrissey can finally be true to himself at Beaufort Hills Academy. But life as a trans man means keeping secrets, and keeping secrets means not getting too close to anyone. If he can just get through his fifth year unnoticed, maybe a future living as the person he was born to be is possible. Yet love is love, and when you fall hard enough, intentions crumble, plans detour, and secrets are revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From multi-award-winning author Mia Kerick, comes a powerful, timely, and life-changing novel, which follows two teenagers nursing broken hearts and seeking acceptance, and who together realize running away isn't always the answer.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

A guy you can’t have when you’ll be leaving at the end of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check. Check. Check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add - especially when the guy is your sexy, tattooed god of a boss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when he not only owns your place of employment but inherited half of the town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when he’s mean to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one night when he demanded I get in his car so he could drive me home because he didn’t want me walking in the dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was sort of how it all started with Rush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then little by little, some of the walls of this hardass man started to come down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never expected that the two of us, seemingly opposites from the outside, would grow so close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't supposed to fall for the rebel heir, especially when he made it clear he didn’t want to cross the line with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the temperature turned cooler, the nights became hotter. My summer became a lot more interesting - and complicated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except our ending was one I didn’t see coming.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan Quinn’s second book in the Getting Lucky series brings heart, humor, and heat back to Port Snow.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two little words every small-town man dreads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She’s back.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper Sanders, the girl who was supposed to be my forever, has returned to Port Snow, Maine, for good—and she’s bringing back memories of our shared past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We once had a bright future together, but when tragedy struck, I threw it all away and pushed her out of my life. People in our small town think I’m cursed, but I know better. I did it all to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now she’s creating a life of her own in the place where we first fell in love. I can’t fight my feelings for her—or the strong attraction that keeps pulling us together. But after all this time, can she forgive the past and fall in love with me all over again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone hopes to find that forever girl…I just hope I haven’t lost mine for good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This spinoff of &lt;/i&gt;The Replacement Crush&lt;i&gt; featuring Amy and Toff is sure to melt your heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shy bookworm Amy McIntyre is about to compete for the chance to interview her favorite author, who hasn't spoken to the press in years. The only way to win is to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight, but that level of confidence has never come easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution? A competition coach. The problem? The best person for the job is the guy she's secretly crushing on…local surfer celebrity Toff Nichols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a player. He’s a heartthrob. He makes her forget basic things, like how to breathe. How can she feel any confidence around &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her surprise, Toff agrees to help. And he’s an excellent teacher. Amy feels braver—maybe even brave enough to admit her feelings for him. When their late night practices become less about coaching and more about making out, Amy’s newfound confidence wavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does Toff really like her or is this just another lesson?</description>

It might take a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it’s not like we’re on a deadline or anything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Westworld&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt; in this stunning fantasy adventure from debut author Charlotte Nicole Davis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aster, the protector&lt;br /&gt;Violet, the favorite&lt;br /&gt;Tansy, the medic&lt;br /&gt;Mallow, the fighter&lt;br /&gt;Clementine, the catalyst&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD LUCK GIRLS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The country of Arketta calls them Good Luck Girls--they know their luck is anything but. Sold to a "welcome house" as children and branded with cursed markings. Trapped in a life they would never have chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clementine accidentally murders a man, the girls risk a dangerous escape and harrowing journey to find freedom, justice, and revenge in a country that wants them to have none of those things. Pursued by Arketta's most vicious and powerful forces, both human and inhuman, their only hope lies in a bedtime story passed from one Good Luck Girl to another, a story that only the youngest or most desperate would ever believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to take more than luck for them all to survive.</description>

Before she has time to think about how to spend her new fortune, she’s hit with an even bigger shock than unexpected wealth. She has three months to live unless she finds a one-in-a-million bone marrow donor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While her medical team scrambles to locate her miracle, Liz throws together a bucket list, charters a private jet, and takes off to see the world. The journey of a lifetime holds even more surprises, including the hunky pilot she’s falling for at the most inconvenient time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Liz die before she can realize her happily-ever-after, or will the universe come through for her one more time? Find out in this humorous tale of true love and adventure! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This romantic comedy kindle book is free for Kindle Unlimited subscribers! A seasoned romance for the ages, perfect for later in life readers who enjoy an older heroine and midlife love.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Isabel has one rule: no dating.&lt;br /&gt;It's easier--&lt;br /&gt;It's safer--&lt;br /&gt;It's better--&lt;br /&gt;--for the other person.&lt;br /&gt;She's got issues. She's got secrets. She's got rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets another sick kid.&lt;br /&gt;He's got a chronic illness Isabel's never heard of, something she can't even pronounce. He understands what it means to be sick. He understands her more than her healthy friends. He understands her more than her own father who's a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;He's gorgeous, fun, and foul-mouthed. And totally into her.&lt;br /&gt;Isabel has one rule: no dating.&lt;br /&gt;It's complicated--&lt;br /&gt;It's dangerous--&lt;br /&gt;It's never felt better--&lt;br /&gt;--to consider breaking that rule for him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Pucked series comes a romantic comedy about instant attraction, second chances, and not-so-little white lies.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need an escape from the demands, the puck bunnies, and the notoriety that come with being an NHL team captain. I just want to be a normal guy for a few weeks. So when I leave Chicago for some peace and quiet, the last thing I expect is for a gorgeous woman to literally fall into my lap on a flight to Alaska. Even better, she has absolutely no idea who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lainey is the perfect escape from my life. My plan for seclusion becomes a monthlong sex fest punctuated with domestic bliss. But it ends just as abruptly as it began. When I’m called away on a family emergency, I realize too late that I have no way to contact Lainey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, a chance encounter throws Lainey and me together again. But I still have a lie hanging over my head, and Lainey’s keeping secrets of her own. With more than lust at stake, the truth may be our game changer.</description>

  <description>Slapped with court ordered community service for brawling—again, Miller Cassidy, the Indianapolis Panther’s star player, is forced into laboring under stodgy non-profit supervisor, Kate Gallagher. Her saving grace—she happens to be best friends with Stella, the woman he’s been chasing for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the masses falling for his charm, Kate doesn’t care for Miller’s notorious reputation or his flippant behavior. But wanting to impress her strict boss, she agrees to a trade that could give them both a shot at success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propelled into an unlikely alliance, Miller finds himself taking a defensive stance when he sees beyond Kate’s hard exterior. And Kate is equally thrown off guard when she discovers there’s more to Miller than games.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But is love worth sacrificing friendship? And can Miller let go of the feelings for Stella he’s held onto for years?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In love and basketball, it’s five fouls and you’re out, and every play counts.</description>

  <description>All I want is to play hockey on the Ice Knights, instead, I’m in a viral video for all the wrong reasons and my mom—yes, my mom—has taken over my dating apps. Then, when I think it can’t get any worse, the fates deliver Zara Ambrose, a five-feet-nothing redhead with more freckles than inches and who’d rather be anywhere other than on a date with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a bet with her friends and my PR nightmare have us both stuck in this go-on-five-dates-with-the-same-person hell situation. But if we band together, we can get the whole thing over with and go on with our lives. It’s perfect! No feelings. No future. No fuc— *ahem* fun. No naked fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could go wrong? Nothing—as long as I remember the rules. Don’t notice the way she looks in a dress. Don’t react when she does that little shivery sigh thing whenever we touch. Don’t think about the fact that she’s never had a toe-curling orgasm that wasn’t self-delivered and just how badly I want to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five dates—that’s it—and then we go our separate ways. At least, that was the plan..</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of the #Lovestruck novels comes a rousing romance about following your dreams, second chances, and playing the game of love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgraced college quarterback Logan Hunt was on his way to NFL stardom when he messed up big-time. Now the Texas star player with a bad temper has a new option: Seattle’s EOL College—as in &lt;i&gt;End of the Line&lt;/i&gt;, to his fellow misfit recruits. It’s Logan’s last chance. &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; he can follow the rules. No parties, no fighting, no swearing, and oh, no dating the coach’s daughter, Jess. Simple. Yeah, right. For Logan, there has never been a rule he’s more tempted to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deal is “just friends.” The pretty, confident, and fiercely smart math whiz is fine with pizza, tutoring, and keeping Logan in line. But the closer Jess gets, the more receptive she is to his warm heart and spirit—not to mention his irresistible off-field passes. With defenses down, they’re both heading into the danger zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s more than thrilling. It’s love. It’s also a game changer that could sideline Logan’s NFL goals—and more important, a future with Jess. But dreams are worth fighting for, right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing an epic new trilogy from Taran Matharu, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times–&lt;/i&gt;bestselling Summoner series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout history, people have vanished with no explanation. A group of teenagers are about to discover why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade is settling into a new boarding school, contemplating his future, when he finds himself transported to another realm. He soon discovers their new world is populated with lost remnants from the past: prehistoric creatures, ancient relics, and stranger still — people. Overwhelmed by his new surroundings, Cade has little time to adjust, for soon he and his fellow classmates are forced to become contenders in a brutal game, controlled by mysterious overlords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who are these beings and why did they choose these teens? Cade must prepare for battle . . . because hiding is not an option.</description>

  <description>What do you do when you’re the reigning kissing booth champion but the only person you want to kiss is your best friend’s brother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make this clear right here, right now: I, Halley Dawson, do not care that Preston Wright is kissing other women. &lt;br /&gt;Not a lick. Not at all. Nuh-uh-freakin’-uh.&lt;br /&gt;I do care that he’s doing it six feet away from me behind a gaudy velvet curtain—making him my competition in this year’s kissing contest.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I care, you ask? Because I’ve had an unfortunate crush on the insufferable idiot since I was sixteen years old, but I also know it’s never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;He’s the Creek Falls bachelor to die for, and I’m the Creek Falls racoon lady who puts peanut butter sandwiches out for them every night.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going to let him break my four-year-long reign—no matter how many times he breaks the rules and slides the curtain across to do the one thing he’s not allowed to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss me.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**He's a Brute is LIVE! Listen as you go with this &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/qfq1otxsfya9p2smfzmic6lg7/playlist/6prmqdxqNBoiNstKEKmIFg?si=69O5LqKkSSmSbztpJzw-XQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;SpotifyPlaylist&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One dark and handsome control-freak sports star meets one smarty pants bioengineer with hair to match her fiery temper. It's an experiment straight out of sexual thermodynamics.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every good scientist knows the second law of thermodynamics: the universe's disorder, entropy, is always increasing. Professionally and personally speaking, Nairne’s familiar with the principle. After a streak of costly fame, now she’s set on saving the world, microscope in hand, and there’s no time for romance. Problem is, when a rude, despicably sexy Adonis shows up to run their board meeting, chemistry and its ensuing chaos become more than a formula—now they’re a burning hot reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mafia prince. Professional footballer. Bad boy demeanor and a reputation for being as talented between the sheets as he is on the pitch. Rumors are the man's an absolute brute. And he turns out to be just as demanding, controlling and vicious in person as he is on paper. The Law of Attraction’s proven true, as Nairne finds herself accepting Zed’s proposal: rough, wild &lt;em&gt;stress release&lt;/em&gt;, more orgasms than she can count, and most importantly—no falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreement in place. End date secured.&lt;/p&gt;No attachments. No forever.What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book One in the Tough Love Series—an enemies to lovers, suspenseful romance, full of sexy Italians, bedroom negotiations, feisty heroines, and an ending that’ll both satisfy you and leave you ready for more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;**CONTAINS SEXUAL CONTENT &amp;amp; EXPLICIT LANGUAGE 18+**&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One hundred years ago when I was young and impulsive (okay, it was five, alright? Five years ago...) I let my boyfriend take, let's just say... compromising pictures of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Shut up. It made sense at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise! The sleazy back-stabbing jerk posted them on a website and, well, you can guess what happened. That's right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a meme. A really gross one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've seen the pictures. And if you haven't - don't ask. And don't look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As face recognition software online improves, I get tagged on social media whenever anyone shares my pictures. You try getting a thousand notifications a day, all of them pictures of your tatas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. I'm done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time for revenge. Let him see how it feels! But how do you get embarrassingly intimate pictures of your jerkface ex who double-crossed you five years ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when he's a member of the U.S.House of Representatives now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting sweet between the sheets with a congressman is pretty much every political roadie's dream, right? I'm one in a crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except to this day, he swears he didn't do it. Pursued me for months after I dumped him five years ago. Begged me to take him back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I almost did it. Almost. I was weak and stupid and in love a hundred years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay. Fine. Five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still have the upper hand. Second chance romance has all the emotional feels, doesn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait to punch him in the feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I need to do is sleep with him once, take some hot-and-sweaty pics of him in... delicate positions, and bring him down. That's it. Nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures first. Revenge after. And then I win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that's how it was supposed to happen. But then I did something worse than sexting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with him. Again.</description>

  <description>Lena and Campbell aren't friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena has her killer style, her awesome boyfriend, and a plan. She knows she's going to make it big. Campbell, on the other hand, is just trying to keep her head down and get through the year at her new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When both girls attend the Friday-night football game, what neither expects is for everything to descend into sudden mass chaos. Chaos born from violence and hate. Chaos that unexpectedly throws them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren't friends. They hardly understand the other's point of view. But none of that matters when the city is up in flames, and they only have each other to rely on if they're going to survive the night.</description>

Which I think was a great way to do it. So you can see how each is feeling and reacting, and how each situation unfolds in their eye...]]>

  <description>Listening Length: 7 hours and 4 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Program Type: Audiobook&lt;br /&gt;Version: Unabridged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-new STANDALONE from New York Times bestselling author Julia Kent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with the wrong Help Wanted ad. Of course it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a professional fluffer. It’s NOT what you think. I stage homes for a living. Real estate agents love me, and my work stands on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. Get your mind out of the gutter. Go ahead. Laugh. I’ll wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See? That’s the problem. My career has used the term “fluffer” for decades. I didn’t even know there was a more… lascivious definition of the term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad for a “professional fluffer” on Craigslist seemed like divine intervention. My last unemployment check was in the bank. I was desperate. Rent was due. The ad said cash paid at the end of the day. The perfect job! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staging homes means showing your best angle. The same principle applies in making a certain kind of movie. Turns out a “fluffer” doesn’t arrange decorative pillows on a couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrange other soft, round-ish objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job isn’t hard. Er, I mean, it is — it’s about being hard. Or, well… helping other people to be hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, man…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s the other problem. A man. No, not one of the stars on the movie set. Will Lotham – my high school crush. The owner of the house where we’re filming. Illegally. In a vacation rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time the cops show up, what I thought was just a great house staging gig turned into a nightmare involving pictures of me with an undressed star, Will rescuing me from an arrest, and a humiliating lesson in my own naivete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job turned out to be so much harder than I expected. But you know what’s easier than I ever imagined?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having all my dreams come true.</description>

  <description>I knew within moments of meeting Mason Holt that he would change my life forever. &lt;br /&gt;I just didn’t realize how much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my world spirals out of control, he continues to stay by my side, protecting and taking care of me. Being &lt;i&gt;just friends&lt;/i&gt; is all he’s been able to offer, that is until both of our lives are threatened. Now that our relationship is blossoming into something more, I can’t be what &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; needs even if I wished I could. &lt;br /&gt;Bad timing strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think we can finally be together, someone threatens to tear us apart. I’m not the same girl Mason met three years ago, but I’m determined to fight for what I’ve always wanted—&lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is book 2 in the Mason &amp;amp; Sophie duet and must be read after Truly Mine. Recommended for ages 18+** &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The night we met in the dimly lit bar, she looked like a brunette bombshell, and I wanted to learn her deepest secrets. With sun-kissed skin and soulful bedroom eyes, she was pure temptation, and I was mesmerized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one drink led to two, I craved more of her playful banter and taunting lips. Resisting her wasn’t an option, and we quickly became a desperate mess of tangled limbs and hot kisses. She tasted like the sweetest sin, but I was no saint. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we caught our breaths, and it became obvious that meeting her wasn’t a coincidence, everything changed. Now I must deny her at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝐹𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠. It’s all we can ever be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of lying to myself and keeping her at a distance, I want to pull her close. Sophie’s on my mind more than ever as my instincts to protect her take over. Regardless of my attempts to help, she pushes me away and makes it clear she doesn’t need me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe, to show her I’m the good guy, but one night takes a tragic turn for the worse when her boyfriend and I start throwing punches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘐’𝘮 𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘶𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**TRULY MINE is an angsty, slow-burn, friends to lovers romance wrapped up in a tragically beautiful love story. It's book 1 in the Mason &amp;amp; Sophie duet and must be read before Truly Yours.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[ I was so excited to get back to find out what Mason and Sophie's story would be. We were left at the end of Hunter and Lennon's duet with a bit of a shocker that made me need this book right then!

  <description>HE WANTS TO LOSE CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;Between his parents’ messed up marriage and his narcissistic younger brother, Lincoln Moorehead has spent the majority of his life avoiding his family. After the death of his father, Lincoln finds himself in the middle of the drama. To top it all off, he’s been named CEO of Moorehead Media, much to his brother’s chagrin. But Lincoln’s bad attitude softens when he meets the no-nonsense, gorgeous woman who has been given the task of transforming him from the gruff, wilderness guy to a suave businessman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE’S TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.&lt;br /&gt;Wren Sterling has been working double time to keep the indiscretions at Moorehead Media at bay, so when she’s presented with a new contract, with new responsibilities and additional incentives, she agrees. Working with the reclusive oldest son of a ridiculously entitled family is worth the hassle if it means she’s that much closer to pursuing her own dreams. What Wren doesn’t expect is to find herself attracted to him, or for it to be mutual. And she certainly doesn’t expect to fall for Lincoln. But when a shocking new Moorehead scandal comes to light, she’s forced to choose between her own family and the broody, cynical CEO.</description>

      <![CDATA[Another perfect story from this author. The hated Armstrong was back, and we got an even closer view at his horribleness, but it was more amusing this time as we weren't watching him actually ruin someone's life. The romance between Lincoln and Wren was a really good one. And I liked a lot how th...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Beard With Me’ is the origin story of Billy Winston and Scarlet St. Claire (aka Claire McClure) and is just the beginning of their epic love story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at surviving than Scarlet St. Claire and making the best out of circumstances beyond her control is Scarlet’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, she’d be the last person on earth, hermitting like a pro, singing along to her CD Walkman, and dancing like no one is watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet is clever, Scarlet is careful, and Scarlet is smart . . . except when it comes to Billy Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at fighting than Billy Winston and raging against his circumstances—because nothing is beyond his control—is Billy’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, he’d be the first person on earth to lead others to safety, overcome catastrophe, or die trying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy is fearless, Billy is disciplined, and Billy is honorable . . . except when it comes to Scarlet St. Claire.</description>

  <description>As everyone at her Brooklyn high school announces their summer adventures, Olivia harbors a dirty secret: Her plan is to binge-watch horror movies and chat with her online friend, Elm. Olivia and Elm have never shared personal details, apart from their ages and the fact that Elm’s aunt is a low-budget horror filmmaker. Then Elm pushes Olivia to share her identity and sends her a selfie of his own. Olivia is shocked by how cute he is! In a moment of panic, assuming she and Elm will never meet in real life, she sends a photo of her gorgeous friend Katie. But things are about to get even more complicated when Olivia’s parents send her to the Catskills, and she runs into the one person she never thought she would see. This sweet and funny summertime romance is perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Love and Gelato &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Unexpected Everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>The worst day of my life happened when Brandon died. &lt;br /&gt;We had our entire future mapped out. &lt;br /&gt;Careers, marriage, kids—in that order. &lt;br /&gt;Then the universe threw a curveball and ended it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I come to terms with everything, I learn I’m carrying his baby. Now I’m living with his roommate, the guy who’s made my life a living hell the past two years. Hunter’s now the one to hold me up when all I want to do is fall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing my religious parents will never accept the pregnancy out of wedlock, Hunter offers to be my fake husband. While I think he’s gone crazy, it’s the only plan that’ll keep them in my life. So I do whatever it takes to make our relationship believable—kissing, touching, even letting him hold me when we sleep. The lines are so blurred neither of us want to admit we’re no longer pretending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guilt of what we’re doing eats me alive as I struggle to deal with my emotions. I push him away, but he pulls me closer, showing me how he’s always felt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I begin to follow my heart, I learn Hunter’s been keeping secrets.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m left to make the hardest decision of my life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is book 2 in the Hunter &amp;amp; Lennon duet and must be read after Baby Mine. Recommended for ages 18+**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Edwin Green's ex-girlfriend is famous. We're talking cover-of-every-tabloid-in-the-grocery-store-line famous. She dumped Edwin one year ago on what he refers to as Black Saturday, and in hopes of winning her back, he's spent the last twelve months trying to become famous himself. It hasn't gone well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a history class assignment pairs Edwin with Parker Haddaway, the mysterious new girl at school, she introduces him to Garland Lenox, a nursing-home-bound World War II veteran who will change Edwin's life forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three escape to France, in search of the old man's long-lost love, and as word of their adventure spreads, they become media darlings. But when things fall apart, they also become the focus of French authorities. In a race against time, who will find love, and who will only find more heartache?</description>

  <description>Ambitious graduate Marin Collins accepts a four-month internship at a prestigious public relations firm to work on a tech account, but her plans are derailed when she’s assigned to go on the road with touring rock band Kings Quarters, hailed by Rolling Stone as the next big thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Brad Osterhauser, the reluctant rock star who would rather be coding computer games than penning Grammy-nominated songs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling by bus, city to city with a group of practical joking bandmates and a greedy manager, Marin and Brad forge a friendship and forbidden romance over a shared love of Seinfeld episodes, stolen moments and Red Vines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Marin’s accused of betraying her company and the band, will Brad come to her defense or believe she was disloyal to him for the sake of her career? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating perspectives of Marin and Brad, Starfish is a contemporary romance of unexpected love, the redemptive power of music and hogging the bed.</description>

  <description>He likes a challenge…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the deal: I’m the best center fielder in the major leagues. I’m also the guy who cost his team the championship game and acted very unsportsmanlike. So, when the team hires a social media manager to repair the damage to my reputation, I don’t argue. But then I meet Chloe Conrad, and I suddenly understand what people mean when they say they have an instant connection to someone. Which means I’m in serious trouble. Chloe’s a smart, sexy distraction I can’t afford, but one date can’t hurt, right? Only she turns me down. And just like that, it’s game on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s sworn off love…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finn Auprince is the hottest player in the major leagues. Look up “It Factor” in the dictionary and there’s his handsome face. He’s also my biggest client and I don’t care how easy it is to talk to him or how fun it is to manage his social media accounts, I will not give in to his charms. Then one drunken night, I tell him about my curse: all my previous boyfriends have found their soul mates while dating me. One more heartbreak, and I’ll never recover. But Finn doesn’t believe in curses—he believes in me. Professionally and personally. He sets out to prove the universe isn’t against me, and that his one true love isn’t waiting around the next corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is…can we play the game of love and both come out on top?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan Quinn delivers a smart and cheeky romance about love’s power to lift hearts . . . and curses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was supposed to be an innocent night, celebrating my brother’s birthday. Nothing was supposed to go wrong. We’d vowed to be on our best behavior after all . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it only took one rowdy night with my brothers to flip my world upside down. One unlucky encounter saddled us with a family curse and the promise of doomed relationships. I laughed it off immediately. “Yeah, right,” I thought. “A love curse. Ha!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word spreads quickly in a town like mine; rumors about that night soon made us the most eligible yet untouchable bachelors in Port Snow, Maine. As a subject of endless gossip and speculation, I could kiss my dating life goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have stayed that way if Ren Winters, the new girl in town, hadn’t crashed into my life. Brave, beautiful, and smart—her vivacious thirst for a fresh start has given me hope that maybe, just maybe, I can have one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wishes for that second chance . . . but could this really be mine?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;‘A must-read modern fairytale!’ Lisa Dickenson on &lt;em&gt;Perfect Match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Surely fairy tales don’t happen in real life? &lt;p&gt;After being jilted at the altar, high-flying journalist Sam doesn’t believe in love any more – and she certainly doesn’t believe in fairy tales! So, when she’s asked to cover the Royal Wedding, it’s the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing she wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when she crashes into a ridiculously handsome stranger, Fredrik, later that day, things are going from bad to worse. But as the big day draws closer, Sam finds herself being swept up in the excitement – as well as swept off her feet by Fredrik!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;But there’s something that Fredrik’s hiding from her – and when he finally reveals his secret, might Sam just have the happy-ever-after she never thought she wanted…?&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes an all-new novel in her beloved With Me In Seattle Series, Dance With Me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Starla. Just Starla. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t have a last name, and she doesn’t need one. Not with that many Grammys on her mantel. Everyone knows her kick-ass, no-holds-barred style of singing, dancing, and living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one knows that America’s Sweetheart is still living with the wreckage of four years ago, when her world was torn apart. Losing her fiancé was devastating, but she’s channeled all of that into her music. Closing off her heart opened a hundred new doors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Officer Levi Crawford, Seattle PD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For almost twenty years, Levi has been consumed by the law. He eats, sleeps, and breathes work. Not just because he’s a workaholic, but because he loves it. Sure, he doesn’t have time for a woman and barely sees the rest of his family, but it’s a trade he’s always been happy to make. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Starla. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two lonely hearts could learn to beat again, if they’re willing to dance together. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new standalone, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy by New York Times bestselling author Helena Hunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosy Felton is great at her job—she knows just how to handle the awkwardness that comes with working at an adult toy store. So when the hottest guy she’s ever seen walks into the shop looking completely overwhelmed, she’s more than happy to turn on the charm and help him purchase all of the items on his list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Mills is using his business trip in Las Vegas as a chance to escape the broken pieces of his life in New York City. The last thing he wants is to be put in charge of buying gag gifts for his friend’s bachelor party. Despite being totally out of his element, and mortified by the whole experience, Griffin is pleasantly surprised when he finds himself attracted to the sales girl that helped him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As skeptical as Cosy may be of Griffin’s motivations, there’s something about him that intrigues her. But sometimes what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas and when real life gets in the way, all bets are off. Filled with hilariously awkward situations and enough sexual chemistry to power Sin City, Making Up is the next standalone in the Shacking Up world.</description>

  <description>From Annie Sullivan, author of &lt;em&gt;A Touch of Gold&lt;/em&gt;, comes &lt;em&gt;Tiger Queen&lt;/em&gt;, a sweeping YA adventure that tells the story of a fierce desert princess as she fights to save her kingdom. Fans of &lt;em&gt;Rebel of the Sands&lt;/em&gt; and Meagan Spooner will devour this retelling of Frank Stockton’s famous short story “The Lady, or the Tiger?”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mythical desert kingdom of Achra, an old law forces sixteen-year-old Princess Kateri to fight in the arena against twelve suitors to prove her right to rule. For Kateri, losing is not an option because in order to fulfil her promise to her late mother, she must win to keep her crown and lead her people. The situation outside the palace is uneasy. The harsh desert is unforgiving, water is scarce, and Kateri’s people are thirsty. To make matters worse, the gang of thieving Desert Boys, the same group that killed Kateri’s mother and her new baby, frequently raids the city wells and steals water, forcing the king to ration what little water is left. The punishment for stealing water is the choice between two doors. Behind one door lies freedom and behind the other is a tiger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Achra are growing restless and distrustful of the monarchy, and when Kateri’s final opponent is announced, she knows she cannot win. In her desperation, Kateri turns to the desert and the one person she never thought she’d side with. Her future now, too, is behind two doors—only she’s not sure which holds the key to keeping her kingdom and which will release the tiger.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A sound awakens her. There's darkness all around. And then she's falling...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;She has no idea who or where she is. Or why she's dead. The only clue to her identity hangs around her neck: a single rusted key. This is how she and the others receive their names—from whatever belongings they had when they fell out of their graves. Under is a place of dirt and secrets, and Key is determined to discover the truth of her past in order to escape it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needs help, but who can she trust? Ribbon seems content in Under, uninterested in finding answers. Doll’s silence hints at deep sorrow, which could be why she doesn't utter a word. There's Smoke, the boy with a fierceness that rivals even the living. And Journal, who stays apart from everyone else. Key's instincts tell her there is something remarkable about each of them, even if she can't remember why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the murders start. Bodies that are burned to a crisp. And after being burned, the dead stay dead. Key is running out of time to discover who she was—and what secret someone is willing to kill to keep hidden—before she loses her life for good…</description>

  <description>Hannah Rae &lt;br /&gt;On stage at a Man Candy night with the music blaring and her hands trailing the oily, well-defined abs of another man is where Hannah-Rae realises that maybe she isn’t as heartbroken about her cheating ex as she had first thought. She had known she needed to make some big decisions about life before flying out to NYC, she just hadn’t expected her heart would be calling all the shots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt&lt;br /&gt;Matt didn’t know why or how his passion for dance had come about. All he knew is that when he was on that stage throwing shapes down, he felt so alive in the moment that he almost forgot about the fact that his family were drowning and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it. Almost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When chance circumstances bring us together, will dancing bring us something more than either of us expected? After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;Each Story is completely stand-alone, but you’ll want to read them all, trust me.</description>

      <![CDATA[It took me about a third of the book to really get into it, but overall this was a pretty sweet story. I like that the two main characters were able to see past their issues in what I felt was a realistic way. Really their back stories were pretty original and I liked that I felt like I was readi...]]>

  <description>ARYA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I can make you blush. &lt;br /&gt;It’s a weird claim to fame, but a perk of my dream job: being the voice of your favorite romance audio books. Laughter, hijinks, adventure. Passion. Sweet heaven, the passion. It’s everything I could ever want. Except… &lt;br /&gt;The problem with this fabulous life? &lt;br /&gt;It’s all just fantasy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking between Chinese and Thai delivery doesn’t count as adventure. &lt;br /&gt;The bestie who always makes me laugh is thousands of miles away. &lt;br /&gt;As for the hunky hero? It’s not like he’s just going to come crashing into my apartment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the night a bearded stranger does exactly that… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GAVIN &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the job. Get the bad guy. Go home. &lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, don’t get involved. &lt;br /&gt;Those are the rules. The agency’s and mine. And they work. Even better, they give me the perfect excuse to keep my distance. &lt;br /&gt;The perfect escape from getting burned again. Except… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can’t I stop watching her? &lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t care more about what she’s doing than my target. &lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t let her distract me from the job. &lt;br /&gt;And I sure as hell shouldn’t fantasize about a woman I’ll never meet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the night I surprise us both by kicking down her apartment door. Rules or no rules, it's true that... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each story in the series is completely standalone.</description>

  <description>Jameson &lt;br /&gt;She hates me. I can’t say I blame her, in fact, I thought it was best this way. That was until I realized just how much I really cared for her. Now all I want to do is protect her. It wasn’t supposed to be this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia &lt;br /&gt;I hate him. He's always been a thorn in my side. When my life is flipped upside down, and I'm fighting to stay above water, things between us shift, and I begin to question everything I thought I knew about the boy next door. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I never should have kissed him. It was only a matter of time. After all, 425 Madison Ave is the perfect place to fall in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the 425 Madison series and all the amazing stories, check out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.425madisonseries.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.425madisonseries.com/&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Dex Mitchell has wanted to play baseball for as long as he can remember. His life was going exactly as it should until a failing grade threatens it all. Dex has no choice, but to go looking for help and where better to look than the quiet girl that sits next to him. If Dex can get her to agree, he might end up needing her for a whole lot more than just tutoring. Callie Fisher is scared, timid, and being held captive by a night that turned horribly wrong. She's happy being invisible to people around her. Except for the guy that sits next to her. He's always noticed her and now he needs her help. What Callie thinks is supposed to just be a couple lessons in the stars turns into a whole lot of unexpected. Callie never anticipated that agreeing to help Dex would in turn help her also. These two come together when they need it most, but as the rules change can they still win the game or will secrets give them a loss?</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; Cassie McKinney has always believed in the Hive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Social media used to be out of control, after all. People were torn apart by trolls and doxxers. Even hackers - like Cassie's dad - were powerless against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But then the Hive came. A better way to sanction people for what they do online. Cause trouble, get too many "condemns," and a crowd can come after you, teach you a lesson in real life. It's safer, fairer and perfectly legal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Entering her senior year of high school, filled with grief over an unexpected loss, Cassie is primed to lash out. Egged on by new friends, she makes an edgy joke online. Cassie doubts anyone will notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the Hive notices everything. And as her viral comment whips an entire country into a frenzy, the Hive demands retribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One moment Cassie is anonymous; the next, she's infamous. And running for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With nowhere to turn, she must learn to rely on herself - and a group of Hive outcasts who may not be reliable - as she slowly uncovers the truth about the machine behind the Hive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; New York Times bestselling authors Barry Lyga and Morgan Baden have teamed up for the first time to create a novel that's gripping, terrifying and more relevant every day, based on a story proposal by Jennifer Beals and Tom Jacobson.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was so good. So much of it relates to what is going on today, our President, our social media issues, society, mob mentality, all of it. It was really scary and had me gasping even at certain parts. It definitely reminded me of one episode of the show Black Mirror that starred Bryce Dal...]]>

  <description>Pretending to date your best friend is always a good idea…right? Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greta Aske has a lot on her mind, and a string of bad dates has her giving up on men, at least for the time being. Her life contains a little too much drama, meaning she needs a break and to save money and get good grades. The perfect solution presents itself—pretend to date the campus playboy. That’ll keep the guys away for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaron Hill is desperate to save his baseball career because, with his dad fighting cancer, he damn well knows he can’t ask for a single penny from his parents. Baseball is his past, present and future, so when a scandal threatens his chance in the MLB, he turns to his best friend for help. A fake relationship will keep him out of trouble. It’s perfect, really. Greta’s taking a break from dating and Aaron needs to focus on training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing could go wrong…as long as neither falls for the other. But when lines are crossed, what’s real and fake blurs and the two are forced to face their fears. Could Greta be the game changer Aaron needs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader advisory: This book contains scenes of underage characters drinking and scenes of violence. There is also a family member with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 2nd April 2019</description>

  <description>Poor judgment: knowing better yet doing it anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flint Stone is a professional in every way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a police officer with the K-9 unit and works at Gun Barrel High as the school resource officer. In his spare time, he’s working his heart out to create a successful gym from the ground up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s loved by every single person he ever encounters—student, faculty, and employees—Everyone but Camryn Elvis Presley. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing they have in common is their mothers’ poor excuses for names. &lt;br /&gt;Period. The end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why is it every time she crosses his path that he has the urge to mess up her perfectly curled hair? Or unbutton a few of her prim and proper buttons? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he should stay away, yet like the high schoolers he’s around every day, he has no choice but to react first and think about the consequences later. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Side note—bad decisions are made, leading to lapses in judgment that threaten both of their jobs. Yet when the time comes, neither one can seem to find the wherewithal to care. Why? Because being bad feels so good.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm pretty sure that Lani Lynn Vale is one of my new favorite authors. I mean, this book started off with a reference to the Final Destination movie series, something that I think about all the time from that movie! It's funny to read my updates on Goodreads as I was reading this, I keep going on...]]>

  <description>I saw her first.&lt;br /&gt;Blonde. Gorgeous. Feisty.&lt;br /&gt;I was &lt;i&gt;smitten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn’t matter because she chose him and he was my best friend and roommate. I’d never be able to compete with that, so I pushed her away instead. It was easy when she lived hours away, and I didn’t have to see her every day, but then she moved in with us. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m &lt;i&gt;screwed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her singing in the shower every morning, dancing in the kitchen while she makes coffee, and doing yoga in our living room, I can’t stop thinking about her in all the wrong ways. She’s not mine and never will be, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to push her against a wall and claim her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s constantly on me for making messes, bringing chicks home every weekend, and being a smartass when their PDA gets on my nerves. Considering neither of them know how I feel, it’s not fair for the way I act toward them. I should move out so I can get over her for good; however, the selfish part of me can’t let go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the unthinkable happens... &lt;br /&gt;When my best friend dies in a motorcycle accident, the two of us are left to grieve our loss together. Instead of pushing her away, I pull her closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as we come to terms with our new reality, she finds out she’s pregnant with his baby. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m left to make the &lt;i&gt;hardest&lt;/i&gt; decision of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**BABY MINE is an angsty, emotional, slow-burn romance wrapped up in a heartbreakingly delicious love story. It's book 1 in the Hunter &amp;amp; Lennon duet of the Roommate Duet Series and must be read first.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>"Hands down, this is the hottest book I've ever read!" ~ Author Elle Thorpe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One woman. Three men. Some things are best kept secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Creslyn Knight auditions for the role of a life time, she never expects three things:&lt;br /&gt;1.To know the casting director—intimately.&lt;br /&gt;2.To be insanely attracted to the three stand-in actors at the audition.&lt;br /&gt;3.That she’d soon be putting her morals to the test when her resolve weakens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting is in Creslyn’s blood, and she’s focused her sights on one thing: landing the role of a lifetime. But she’s always been told that everything comes at a cost. The casting director names his when he tells her she must make him believe she can surrender to a harem of men, or he can’t justify giving her the lead role. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to prove him wrong and show him she can tap into a passion that deep, Creslyn throws herself into rehearsals. But the fine line between script and reality soon starts to blur, leading her and three men into unchartered territory. The only problem? She has a jealous roommate, a disgruntled mother, and a string of paparazzi hot on her trail, making Creslyn question the cost of everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where some things are best kept secret, is the price of fame too high when it comes to the heart? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stars in Her Eyes is a new adult, steamy contemporary romance that features all the heat you expect from a multi-partner romance, with a storyline and HEA readers crave with a contemporary love story. Finally, the best of both worlds!</description>

      <![CDATA[ I really enjoyed this book. Might even be closer to 4.5 stars instead of just 4 stars. Most of the time you see the reverse harem books they seem to be fantasy or science fiction. As I'm not a big fan of those types of romances, I am glad to see more and more that are contemporary, or at least m...]]>

  <description>Savannah&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think I was missing anything. I had my son, a great career, and a home that I’d made for both of us. One puck over the glass at a hockey game made me realize I wanted more. The larger-than-life hockey player inserted himself into our world and I never wanted to let him go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, I don’t know if I’m strong enough to keep him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porter&lt;br /&gt;My home was on the ice, with a stick in my hand and a puck on my tape. It took one little boy with a toothless smile and his spitfire mother to change all that. I wanted them to be my home and I was willing to take all the penalties necessary to make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just have to convince her that we can handle it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melding three lives into one isn’t as easy as it seems, especially with the traveling, the media, and the insecurities. Savannah and Porter have to decide whether to use the breakaway to head to the goal or take a seat on the bench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the 425 Madison series and all the amazing stories, check out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.425madisonseries.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.425madisonseries.com/&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;Ask Me Anything &lt;i&gt;isn't just any YA romance. This is a badass YA romance…"&lt;/i&gt; -Hypabale.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should’ve kept my mouth shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wilmont Academy’s been living in the Dark Ages when it comes to sex ed, and someone had to take matters into her own hands. Well, I’m a kickass coder, so I created a totally anonymous, totally untraceable blog where teens can come to get real, honest, nothing-is-off-limits sex advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And holy hell, the site went viral overnight. Who knew this school was so hard up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the school administration is on a war path to shut me down, and they have Dean—my coding crush—hot on my trail. If he discovers my secret, I could lose his trust forever. And thousands of teens who need real advice won’t have anyone to turn to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask me anything…except how to make things right.</description>

  <description>New Sports Romance coming in Spring 2019!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the red zone is the hardest place to score.&lt;br /&gt;But for me, those last twenty yards were my sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;They didn't call me Lukas "Last Minute Lucy" Callihan for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I was at the top of my game...until life sacked me harder than any linebacker ever could.&lt;br /&gt;Losing my mom was devastating and left me as the sole person responsible for my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking care of Ella and juggling my career was like playing the hardest game of my life. &lt;br /&gt;My only saving grace was Scarlett Knox, Ella's sexy, red-headed, no-nonsense teacher. &lt;br /&gt;She loved Ella. She hated me. &lt;br /&gt;She thought I sucked at this parenting thing, and she wasn’t wrong. &lt;br /&gt;But whenever she was around I got the same earth-shattering, heart-stopping feeling I did when I was only twenty yards from the goal line.&lt;br /&gt;She made me feel like I was back in the red zone, a place I’d never fumbled.&lt;br /&gt;Until now. </description>

  <description>Coming May 16!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALLIE HARRIS WANTS PAYBACK. &lt;br /&gt;Her cheating ex deserves to see her living her best life; a one-night-stand with a hot South African soccer player would be the perfect revenge. Right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. Allie is so, so wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROAN DEWALT HAS ALL THE MOVES. &lt;br /&gt;On and off the field he’s at the top of his game. Roan respects hard-work, dedication—and follow through. He’s not a one and done kind of man, and he’s far from being done with Allie Harris. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One sexy night and two years later, Allie’s job brings her back to town. An opportunity for the perfect replay Roan has been fantasizing about since they slept together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROBLEM? &lt;br /&gt;Allie Harris has a secret; one she’s been keeping from Roan all this time. Video proof of their one night together—taken without his consent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Allie’s payback plan come back to bite them both? Or can she erase her past mistake and embrace a new future with Roan?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“How long do you last in bed?” Those were her first words to me, swiftly followed up with, “And how big would you say you are?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persephone Alexander. Math genius. Lover of blazers. The only girl I know who can make Heidi braids look sexy as hell. And she’s on a mission. Lose her virginity by the end of the semester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked in on her interview session for potential candidates (who even does that?) and saw straight through her brave front. She’s got a list of Firsts to accomplish like she’s only got months to live. I’ve decided to be her guide for all her firsts except one. Someone’s got to keep her out of trouble. I have one rule, no sex. We even shook on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll help her find the right guy for the job. Someone like her doesn’t need someone like me and my massive...baggage for her first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking at a bar. Check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partying all night. Double check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny dipping. Triple check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met. The walls I’d put up around my heart are slowly crumbling with each touch that sets fire to my soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the first to bend the rules. One electrifying kiss changes everything and suddenly I don’t want to be her first, I want to be her only. But her plan was written before I came onto the scene and now I’m determined to get her to re-write her future with me.</description>

  <description>Listening length: 7 hours, 6 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a good idea at the time. Look up Landon Roderick, that boy from childhood whom I’d never been able to forget—even though he so easily forgot about me—and call him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, anything sounds like a good idea when you’ve had a little too much wine before bed, right? It was supposed to be just a quick, meaningless, prank call. Instead, I went off on him—unloading thirteen years of pent-up emotions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think he’d call me back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly could never have anticipated the weeks of sexually tense phone conversations that followed as I got to know the man he’d become. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out, Landon had never really forgotten me, either. That special connection we had was still there. I opened up to him, but there were also things about me he didn’t know. And he had his own secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the countless hours we talked on the phone, I wondered what would happen if we actually saw each other. One night, I did something impulsive again. Only this time, I went to the airport and booked a ticket to California. We were about to find out if one phone call could bring two lost souls together or if my drunk dial really was all just a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete STANDALONE.</description>

      <![CDATA[My third book by this author and once again I really enjoyed it! At first, I was a little unsure. I figured that the main character must have some kind of scar or something, but the reason that she didn't want to show her face to Landon was a total surprise to me. Although I was unable to underst...]]>

  <description>Top Tip: Don’t put out an online ad offering your services as a fake date. Someone will take you up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it won’t just be for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up being Mason Jackson’s fake girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t even want me to be. No—his sister was solely responsible for me being his date for his ten-year high school reunion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s responsible for telling his parents our relationship is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no choice. We have to act like this isn’t all a mistake, like it’s not all fake, like we’re totally, completely, utterly, head-over-heels in love with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanted: one hot guy with rock-hard abs and a big stick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broke and desperate, Sugar Ryan has no use for arrogant, bad boy athletes . . . until she’s forced to bargain with the cockiest of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he knew she was alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mission? Get on this hockey player’s radar any way possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack Morgan is the king of the ice and the bedroom—but nothing prepares him for the mystery girl who shows up everywhere he does—frat parties, his favorite bar, and finally his front door with an offer he can’t refuse. The only rule in her boyfriend bargain: &lt;b&gt;no falling in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one (um, two) smoking-hot hookups, he’s done with pretending and vows to make their fake relationship real. Too bad she can’t trust a player with a reputation for breaking hearts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this hockey star score his forever girl or will their Boyfriend Bargain end in heartbreak? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A standalone hockey romance.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“The Silence Between Us is eminently un-put-down-able.” (&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a great YA contemporary (clean) romance that follows Maya as she navigates a new school and plans for her future. The addition of representation by a Deaf character was really beautifully done. Highly recommend for people looking for a sweet, engaging, and educational romantic read.” (&lt;em&gt;YA and Kids Book Central&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#OwnVoices YA novel features Deaf / Hard of Hearing Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s time we see more Deaf characters in books. It’s time we see more books celebrating sign language and Deaf culture,” said author Alison Gervais.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deaf teen Maya moves across the country and must attend a hearing school for the first time. As if that wasn’t hard enough, she also has to adjust to the hearing culture, which she finds frustrating—and also surprising when some classmates, including Beau Watson, take time to learn ASL. As Maya looks past graduation and focuses on her future dreams, nothing, not even an unexpected romance, will not derail her pursuits. But when people in her life—Deaf and hearing alike—ask her to question parts of her Deaf identity, Maya stands proudly, never giving in to the idea that her Deafness is a disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Silence Between Us&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features a Deaf protagonist and an #OwnVoices perspective on Deaf and Hard of Hearing culture&lt;br /&gt;Is a clean YA romance by Wattpad sensation Alison Gervais&lt;br /&gt;Is perfect for fans of Nicola Yoon and CeCe Bell</description>

It’s the perfect place to hide from her family and the tragic events that led to their estrangement. However, when her father, the person she loves most in the world, needs her Dahlia has no choice but to return to Boston to face her ghosts. One of those happens to be her ex-boyfriend’s best friend, Michael Sullivan. The man she was never supposed to fall in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Sullivan has never forgotten Dahlia McGuire. Some might say he’s never gotten over her. For years he lived with the anger of her desertion, and now, newly-divorced, he’s finally ready to move on. That proves impossible when Dahlia returns to Boston and reawakens their explosive connection. Despite everything, Michael wants her back, but Dahlia can’t seem to let go of the tangled emotions of the past. When she flees home to Hartwell, Michael follows, determined to do everything in his power to convince her they belong together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the unthinkable hits the quiet seaside town, Michael finds himself trying to unravel more than the mystery of Dahlia’s broken heart. It’s time for truths left unsaid to finally be spoken or Michael and Dahlia might find themselves torn apart forever…</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Proby… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fallon McCarthy has climbed the corporate ladder. She’s had the office with the view, the staff, and the plaque on her door. The unexpected loss of her grandmother taught her that there’s more to life than meetings and conference calls, so she quit, and is happy to be a nomad, checking off items on her bucket list as she takes jobs teaching yoga in each place she lands in. She’s happy being free, and has no interest in being tied down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Noah King gets the call that an eagle has been injured, he’s not expecting to find a beautiful stranger standing vigil when he arrives. Rehabilitating birds of prey is Noah’s passion, it’s what he lives for, and he doesn’t have time for a nosy woman who’s suddenly taken an interest in Spread Your Wings sanctuary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Fallon’s gentle nature, and the way she makes him laugh, and feel again draws him in. When it comes time for Fallon to move on, will Noah’s love be enough for her to stay, or will he have to find the strength to let her fly? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kristen Proby Crossover Collection features a new novel by Kristen Proby and six by some of her favorite writers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristen Proby – Soaring with Fallon &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Bennett – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401055.Wicked_Force" title="Wicked Force" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;K.L.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new best-friends-to-lovers romcom from Emma Hart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let your homeless best friend stay with you, he said. Being roommates will be fun, he said. It's only temporary, he said.&lt;br /&gt;He never said I'd fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what isn't 'temporary?' The endless stream of dirty socks in my bathroom and empty food packets under the sofa—and don't even get me started on the hot guys who take over my living room every Sunday to watch sports.&lt;br /&gt;I can't take anymore. &lt;br /&gt;So I propose a roommate agreement. One that will bring peace and order back to my life, complete with rules that might just stop my newfound crush on my best friend in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;After all, there’s only so many times you can see your best friend naked before you start to lose your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules. They're meant to be broken... Aren't they?</description>

  <description>Eliza: My life is perfect. I have a luxurious apartment and my dream job. I also have a sister willing to sign me up for a dating app against my better judgment. I promise her one week before the app is deleted forever. &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one week before I’m matched with two amazing men and my perfect life becomes a perfect disaster. &lt;br /&gt;Murphy: I needed a drastic change and I got it. My move from the middle of nowhere to the city lands me in a classy part of town with an upscale job. All I need is a personal life to match. So, I join the masses and download an app.&lt;br /&gt;A match with the woman of my dreams has me considering a future. The only problem is that &lt;br /&gt;I’m not the only one wanting to make her mine. &lt;br /&gt;After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love!</description>

  <description>The only reason Lauren entered the Hashtag Hunt was for the $10,000 grand prize. She needed seed money for her startup, and it sounded easy enough: twelve hours to text twelve photos to someone called the Wizard. For hashtag number five, Lauren needs a #HottieInTheWild, and with the help of her best friend, Ivy, she finds the perfect subject. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason Brenner entered Barkley’s Pub was to have beers with Scott, an Army brother back in town. The reunion is interrupted when a woman is caught crouched in a dark corner, taking pictures of Brenner. Lauren explains, and though embarrassed, she accepts Scott and Brenner’s offer to help with hashtag number six. &lt;br /&gt;While hunting for hashtags, Lauren finds adventure and romance with her #Hottie, but she must stay focused to beat the clock and win the cash.</description>

  <description>In life, you can't only fight for what you believe in . . .sometimes you have to fight for what you love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan fights for lost causes. Probably because she used to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental issues, civil rights, education—you name it, she's probably been involved in a protest. When her latest cause lands her in jail for a few hours, she meets Silas Moore. He's in for a different kind of fighting. And though he's arrogant and not at all her type, she can't help being fascinated with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another lost cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football and trouble are the only things that have ever come naturally to Silas. And it's trouble that lands him in a cell next to do-gooder Dylan. He's met girls like her before—fixers, he calls them, desperate to heal the damage and make him into their ideal boyfriend. But he doesn't think he's broken, and he definitely doesn't need a girlfriend trying to change him. Until, that is, his anger issues and rash decisions threaten the only thing he really cares about, his spot on the Rusk University football team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan might just be the perfect girl to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Silas Moore needs some fixing after all.</description>

  <description>Josh Matthews had a childhood he would rather forget...and he never really knew what it meant to be in a family or to call a place home. His circle of friends are the closest he has come to a family as are his teammates on the Kansas City Chiefs. He is their quarterback and loves playing football. When he sees a fan holding a sign up in the first regular season game, his superstitious teammates tease him that she could be his lucky charm. Dillon Winters knows all to well how being star-struck can hurt you. She got away from her ex-husband and is working hard to take care of her daughter, Lilly. She goes to a football game to drum up business for her bar and meets Josh Matthews, who makes her realize that giving love a second chance can fulfill her life in ways she didn't even know she was missing.</description>

  <description>Have you heard the rumor around campus about the locker room?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't, let me enlighten you: Legend has it if you bring a girl into the sacred after-game domain of the baseball locker room, it will end with a walk down the aisle. One rowdy and naked encounter against the lockers with the girl of your dreams will make her your wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Translation: baseball players are stupidly superstitious and believe the locker room has magical powers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all baseball players are superstitious, me included. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the girl I've fallen for brushes me off, I start to question if I need to switch my way of thinking. Maybe it's time I finally hand out a coveted invitation to the locker room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question is, will she accept?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is nothing in the world as magical and terrifying as a girl.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Guinevere has come to Camelot to wed a stranger: the charismatic King Arthur. With magic clawing at the kingdom's borders, the great wizard Merlin conjured a solution -- send in Guinevere to be Arthur's wife... and his protector from those who want to see the young king's idyllic city fail. The catch? Guinevere's real name -- and her true identity -- is a secret. She is a changeling, a girl who has given up everything to protect Camelot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep Arthur safe, Guinevere must navigate a court in which the old -- including Arthur's own family -- demand things continue as they have been, and the new -- those drawn by the dream of Camelot -- fight for a better way to live. And always, in the green hearts of forests and the black depths of lakes, magic lies in wait to reclaim the land. Arthur's knights believe they are strong enough to face any threat, but Guinevere knows it will take more than swords to keep Camelot free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly jousts, duplicitous knights, and forbidden romances are nothing compared to the greatest threat of all: the girl with the long black hair, riding on horseback through the dark woods toward Arthur. Because when your whole existence is a lie, how can you trust even yourself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Kiersten White comes a new fantasy series reimagining the Arthurian legend, set in the magical world of Camelot.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From Danielle Vega, YA’s answer to Stephen King, comes a new paranormal novel about dark family secrets, deep-seated vengeance, and the horrifying truth that evil often lurks in the unlikeliest of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hendricks Becker-O’Malley is new in town, and she’s bringing baggage with her. With a dark and wild past, Hendricks doesn’t think the small town her parents moved her to has much to offer her in terms of excitement. She plans on laying low, but when she’s suddenly welcomed into the popular crowd at school, things don’t go as expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hendricks learns from her new friends that the fixer-upper her parents are so excited about is notorious in town. Local legend says it’s haunted. Hendricks doesn’t believe it. Until she’s forced to. Blood-curdling screams erupt from the basement, her little brother wakes up covered in scratches, and something, or someone pushes her dad down the stairs. With help from the mysterious boy next door, Hendricks makes it her mission to take down the ghosts . . . if they don’t take her first.</description>

Now it’s senior year, and Alicea has taken over the business and given it an upgrade using an automated matchmaking program designed to help her classmates find their perfect match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alicea has no interest in using the program herself. She already knows who her perfect match is … Ty. She doesn’t need an app to tell her that (or worse, match her up with someone else). In a moment of weakness, Alicea allows her friends to convince her to give the program a try. To her horror, it matches her with the last boy on earth she'd ever want to date — Darius Groves, the class deadbeat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she and Darius are paired up for a class project, Alicea learns there's more to him than his bad reputation. But the more she spends time with Darius, the more she questions their match. They have so little in common. Why did her program match them? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Alicea defy the odds and make a match of her own heart’s desire? Or will the matchmaker remained unmatched?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Andrew Smith comes the stunning, long-awaited sequel to the groundbreaking Printz Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Grasshopper Jungle&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been sixteen years since an army of horny, hungry, six-foot-tall praying mantises forced Arek’s family underground and into the hole where he was born; it’s the only home he’s ever known. But now, post-end-of-the-world, the army of horny, hungry praying mantises might finally be dying out, and Arek’s ready to leave the hole for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he has are mysterious letters from Breakfast, a naked, wild boy traveling the countryside with his silent companion, Olive. Together, Arek and his best friend Mel, who stowed away in his van, navigate their way through the ravaged remains of the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This long-awaited sequel to the irreverent, groundbreaking Printz Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Grasshopper Jungle&lt;/i&gt; is stunning, compelling, and even more hilarious and beautifully bizarre than its predecessor.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Driven series comes a powerful romance about reaching great heights through low depths.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who says you have to play by the rules to get what you want?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to meet Ryker Lockhart is my first mistake. Rich, handsome, and more than intriguing, he thinks blackmail will bend me to his will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he’s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have done a few things that weren’t exactly legal, but I have my own reasons for that. The last thing I’m going to do is let some high-powered divorce attorney come into my life, have my body, and rule my heart. Not to mention ruin everything that I have carefully built in just a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as much as I try to resist him, and against my better judgment, there is something about him that has me agreeing to his proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m putting everything on the line for him. I just hope I won’t lose everything when this is all over.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Samantha Young… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn O’Dea has always tried to see the best in people while her big brother, Killian, has always tried to protect her from the worst. While their lonely upbringing made Killian a cynic, it isn’t in Autumn’s nature to be anything but warm and open. However, after a series of relationship disasters and the unsettling realization that she’s drifting aimlessly through life, Autumn wonders if she’s left herself too vulnerable to the world. Deciding some distance from the security blanket of her brother and an unmotivated life in Glasgow is exactly what she needs to find herself, Autumn takes up her friend’s offer to stay at a ski resort in the snowy hills of Montana. Some guy-free alone time on Whitetail Mountain sounds just the thing to get to know herself better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, she wasn’t counting on colliding into sexy Grayson King on the slopes. Autumn has never met anyone like Gray. Confident, smart, with a wicked sense of humor, he makes the men she dated seem like boys. Her attraction to him immediately puts her on the defense because being open-hearted in the past has only gotten it broken. Yet it becomes increasingly difficult to resist a man who is not only determined to seduce her, but adamant about helping her find her purpose in life and embrace the person she is. Autumn knows she shouldn’t fall for Gray. It can only end badly. After all their lives are divided by an ocean and their inevitable separation is just another heart break away… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kristen Proby Crossover Collection features a new novel by Kristen Proby and six by some of her favorite writers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristen Proby – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401054.Soaring_with_Fallon" title="Soaring with Fallon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soaring with Fallon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Bennett – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401055.Wicked_Force" title="Wicked Force" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;K.L.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Full of dark mystery and unexpected twists.”&lt;/i&gt; —Meg Kassel, author of &lt;i&gt;Keeper of the Bees&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A sound awakens her. There's darkness all around. And then she's falling...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;She has no idea who or where she is. Or why she's dead. The only clue to her identity hangs around her neck: a single rusted key. This is how she and the others receive their names—from whatever belongings they had when they fell out of their graves. Under is a place of dirt and secrets, and Key is determined to discover the truth of her past in order to escape it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needs help, but who can she trust? Ribbon seems content in Under, uninterested in finding answers. Doll’s silence hints at deep sorrow, which could be why she doesn't utter a word. There's Smoke, the boy with a fierceness that rivals even the living. And Journal, who stays apart from everyone else. Key's instincts tell her there is something remarkable about each of them, even if she can't remember why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the murders start. Bodies that are burned to a crisp. And after being burned, the dead stay dead. Key is running out of time to discover who she was—and what secret someone is willing to kill to keep hidden—before she loses her life for good…</description>

  <description>As the brains behind wedding site TyingTheKnot.com, Callie sees it all: from the ring to the dress, the smiles... to the tears. It's that last part that keeps her single and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; looking. Getting left at the altar will do that to a girl. But when Callie returns to her old hometown, she finds that her sweet high school crush is sexier than ever. And he makes it hard to remember why she's sworn off love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanner is a deep-sea diver with a wild, adrenaline-junkie past-and now his teenage son is back in his life. How can Tanner be a role model when he's still paying for his own mistakes? It's hard enough that gorgeous Callie has appeared in town like a beautiful dream, challenging his best-laid plans to keep his heart on lockdown. Though there's something about being around her again that makes him feel like he can be the man she—and his son—deserve. Little Lucky Harbor holds their past; can it hold a beautiful new future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording (8 hours, 48 minutes).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was my first book by this author, and while I had some issues with it, I definitely enjoyed it enough that I am going to want to read more. Sometimes I have trouble listening to books that are in third person, especially romance, I kind of like the first person better. I think I'd have liked...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 25 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristen Leonard is done with setups. She’s not interested in your son or your nephew or your butcher or the guy who mows your lawn, thank you very much, grandma! After all, she’s a modern woman—she’ll take her chances on the algorithms of online dating to find her ideal man. Before long, she meets a man who might just be the one—he’s hilarious, quick-witted, and full of heart. And when she meets up with Cameron in real life, he certainly looks exactly like his profile picture…but something’s not quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s really no telling what brought them together and all bets are off as to whether or not they can trust their hearts over their heads. After all, can you fall in love with someone you’re not sure you really even know?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She hid secret messages in frosting, thinking no one would notice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abby Tyler welcomes you to the witty, well-meaning busybodies of Applebottom, Missouri, where the community takes its pies -- and its matchmaking -- very seriously.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Sandy Miller emerges from her shack on the edge of town after eighteen years, she finds a job making tea cakes for a little shop on Town Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then everyone starts spotting secret words of love and longing on her cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew McCallister is the first to admit that he never got over Sandy Miller when she dropped out of high school and disappeared. But now she’s back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He just has to get the guts to talk to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the town summons the pair to a meeting to plan the school’s centennial bash, Andrew and Sandy discover they are the only two members of the committee. As they attempt to rekindle the long-lost flame, they realize the community must come together for more than an anniversary party. For their new relationship to flourish, the old guard must learn to support their most vulnerable members even when times get hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today bestselling author Meghan Quinn comes a forbidden romance about an Irish rebel who falls in love with the wrong girl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Diary, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have gotten myself into a wee bit of trouble—and I'm not talking about the "court mandated community service," or “therapy sessions from bashing a bloke in the head" kind of trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were that simple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. I’m talking about the "falling in love with one of my client's daughters,” kind of trouble . . . The kind of problem I can’t talk my way out of when the truth gets out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I ended up with her phone is a long story—and when she called to get it back, I took things a bit too far. One innocent exchange wound up leading to so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun, new, and totally immune to my charm, Sutton is different. And I had no idea she was the daughter of Foster Green. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blame it on the dark colored stout running through my veins, pushing me toward one bad decision after another. Pushing me toward her even though I know right from wrong; even though she's my client's daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating her might be the best or worst decision I've ever made. Only time, whiskey, and one more roll around the mattress with her will tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roark</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Lucky in Love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the name of the dating app I picked, hoping to find Mr. Better Than Average so I can hold off planning my future as a cat lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been distracted eyeballing a tall, dark, and handsome Latin hottie who works in the library with me. He is way out of my league, and a woman has needs if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a man shouldn’t be hard when all I have to do is swipe left or right. It’ll weed out the slimy men who have Bad Date written all over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I’m learning quickly that I’m rather unlucky in love after all. The men I pick need warning labels, kissing lessons, and a good talking-to about manners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I throw in the towel, or will this series of bad dates be exactly what I need to win Mr. Right?</description>

  <description>Evalina Cassano’s life in an Italian-American family in 1941 is everything it “should be” until she falls in love with Taichi Hamasaki, the son of Japanese immigrants. Despite the scandal it would cause and that inter-racial marriage is illegal in California, Evalina and Taichi vow they will find a way to be together. But anti-Japanese feelings erupt across the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Taichi and his family are forced to give up their farm and move to an internment camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degrading treatment make life at Manzanar Relocation Center difficult. Taichi’s only connection to the outside world are treasured letters from Evalina. Feeling that the only action she can take to help Taichi is to speak out on behalf of all Japanese Americans, Evalina becomes increasingly vocal at school and at home. Meanwhile, inside Manzanar, fighting between different Japanese-American factions arises. Taichi begins to doubt he will ever leave the camp alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tensions running high and their freedom on the line, Evalina and Taichi must hold true to their values and believe in their love to make a way back to each other against unbelievable odds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jock-jerk. Arrogant hockey player who thinks he’s god’s gift to women.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;That’s the Tucker Kane I know.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago we hooked-up, and he walked away like it was nothing. Like I meant nothing. Now, he needs my help to pass a class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a message from PuckMe_69 in response to my tutoring post, I have no idea it’s Tucker. He has no clue I’m the girl from his past who still hates his guts. At first, I tell him to go puck himself and walk away. But he’s as persistent as he is sexy. And I need the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we come to an agreement. One that ends with us breaking all the rules… and if I’m not careful, my heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The task is simple: don a disguise. Survive the Labyrinth. Best the boys.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a thrilling new fantasy from the bestselling author of the Storm Siren Trilogy, one girl makes a stand against society and enters a world made exclusively for boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year for the past fifty-four years, the residents of Pinsbury Port have received a mysterious letter inviting all eligible-aged boys to compete for an esteemed scholarship to the all-male Stemwick University. The poorer residents look to see if their names are on the list. The wealthier look to see how likely their sons are to survive. And Rhen Tellur opens it to see if she can derive which substances the ink and parchment are created from, using her father’s microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the province of Caldon, where women train in wifely duties and men pursue collegiate education, sixteen-year-old Rhen Tellur wants nothing more than to become a scientist. As the poor of her seaside town fall prey to a deadly disease, she and her father work desperately to find a cure. But when her mum succumbs to it as well? Rhen decides to take the future into her own hands—through the annual all-male scholarship competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her cousin, Seleni, by her side, the girls don disguises and enter Mr. Holm’s labyrinth, to best the boys and claim the scholarship prize. Except not everyone is ready for a girl who doesn’t know her place. And not everyone survives the deadly maze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Labyrinth.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling Winternight Trilogy, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Winternight Trilogy introduced an unforgettable heroine, Vasilisa Petrovna, a girl determined to forge her own path in a world that would rather lock her away. Her gifts and her courage have drawn the attention of Morozko, the winter-king, but it is too soon to know if this connection will prove a blessing or a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.</description>

  <description>Look up the word “nerd” and you’ll find Lily Bailey’s picture. She’s got one goal: first stop valedictorian, next stop Harvard. Until a stint in the hospital from too much stress lands her in the last place a klutz like her ever expected to be: salsa dance lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up the word “popular” and you’ll find Stone Torres’s picture. His life seems perfect—star of the football team, small-town hero, lots of friends. But his family is struggling to make ends meet, so if pitching in at his mom's dance studio helps, he’ll do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lily’s dad offers Stone extra cash to volunteer as Lily’s permanent dance partner, he can’t refuse. But with each dip and turn, each moment her hand is in his, his side job starts to feel all too real. Lily shows Stone he's more than his impressive football stats, and he introduces her to a world outside of studying. But with the lines blurred, can their relationship survive the secret he's been hiding?</description>

      <![CDATA[As you can tell by my rating of 5 stars, I adored this story! It was one I picked up and was immediately sucked into what was happening. The characters were extremely relatable, but also realistic. While we had the klutziness of our heroine like we see a lot of times, she was able to get over it...]]>

  <description>No one tells you what happens when you fall in love with your best friend. &lt;br /&gt;They don’t tell you it’s like waiting for the answer to a question no one can hear you ask. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Brynn Darling, a successful event coordinator at the top of her game. The future is hers for the taking, except for one thing. After many failed attempts at finding love, and a realization that her best friend is clueless, she decides it’s time to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton Cole has been in the friend zone since . . . well, forever. So, he fills the void with unimportant people and never gets attached. That is until Brynn begins seeing a guy who threatens everything he’s ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’ll never happen.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe she’ll fall in love with the wrong guy.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe they’ll get their ever after . . . after all.</description>

      <![CDATA[So, I loved the Comic-Con aspect to this story so much! Now, names were changed, but basically they were doing conventions for a tv show a lot like one of my favorites, Supernatural. Only in this world, the obvious play on my favorite actor on the show, Jensen Ackles, is single. And he's into our...]]>

  <description>When she was a child, Joey Kinkaid, assigned as a boy at birth—wearing Mom’s purple sundress and an imaginary crown—ruled the Baker Street neighborhood with a flair and imagination that kept the other kids captivated. Day after day, she led them on fantastic after-school adventures, but those innocent childhood days are over, and the magic is gone. The princess is alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Eric Sinclair, the Prince Eric to Joey’s Princess Ariel, has turned his back on his former friend, watching in silence as Joey is tormented at school. Eric isn’t proud of it, but their enchanted youth is over, and they’ve been thrust into a dog-eat-dog world where those who conform survive and those who don’t… well, they don’t. Eric has enough to deal with at home, where his mother has abandoned him to live in isolation and poverty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Eric can’t stay on the sidelines forever. When Joey finally accepts her female gender and comes to school wearing lip gloss, leggings, and a silky pink scarf, the bullies readily take the opportunity she hands them, driving Joey to attempt suicide and leaving Eric at a crossroads—one that will influence both their lives in not just the present, but the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a chance the two teens can be friends again, and maybe even more?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Debut YA author Natasha Diaz pulls from her personal experience to inform this powerful coming-of-age novel about the meaning of friendship, the joyful beginnings of romance, and the racism and religious intolerance that can both strain a family to the breaking point and strengthen its bonds.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is Nevaeh Levitz?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in an affluent suburb of New York City, sixteen-year-old Nevaeh Levitz never thought much about her biracial roots. When her Black mom and Jewish dad split up, she relocates to her mom's family home in Harlem and is forced to confront her identity for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevaeh wants to get to know her extended family, but one of her cousins can't stand that Nevaeh, who inadvertently passes as white, is too privileged, pampered, and selfish to relate to the injustices they face on a daily basis as African Americans. In the midst of attempting to blend their families, Nevaeh's dad decides that she should have a belated bat mitzvah instead of a sweet sixteen, which guarantees social humiliation at her posh private school. Even with the push and pull of her two cultures, Nevaeh does what she's always done when life gets complicated: she stays silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's only when Nevaeh stumbles upon a secret from her mom's past, finds herself falling in love, and sees firsthand the prejudice her family faces that she begins to realize she has a voice. And she has choices. Will she continue to let circumstances dictate her path? Or will she find power in herself and decide once and for all who and where she is meant to be?</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

      <![CDATA[Maybe 2.5 stars. I was really excited about this one. I mean, the cover, the synopsis, it just all sounded really good. But it took so long for anything really to happen. And then, when it did, it wasn't really anything that exciting. It was about a third of the way through, and I got excited, bu...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My first crush. My first heartbreak. My brother’s best friend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butterflies in my stomach turned into full blown eagles the second our lips touched. A kiss under the stars that changed our relationship forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of wishing, I stared up into Ford’s eyes with his fingers caressing my cheek and my heart racing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening ended with my heart bleeding on the ballroom floor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He destroyed my heart two years ago...but now he wants back in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I won’t fall under his spell. I’ll resist his sexy, scruffy beard, and panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was over him. Hell, I fully planned to wave to him through my rearview mirror...but with one text, in the middle of the night, I know I'm in over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ford: I need you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Two minutes in the box or a lifetime out&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey player Aidan Lefèvre’s professional and personal life is on ice. Recovering from an injury and traded to a new team, Aidan is attempting to prove his viability to his coaches, fans, and teammates. Just when he believes he’s succeeded, another accident during the playoffs threatens to unravel all of his progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having relocated away from family and friends, Aidan turns to his extroverted team captain, Christophe Fontenot, whose jovial nature lifts everyone’s spirits. But when Aidan discovers his attraction for Christophe changes the meaning of “body checking,” Aidan questions more than his hockey skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should he deny what he feels or come out of the “box?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the Game On Collection.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;It’s been ten years.&lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t stopped loving her for one second. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the woman who broke my heart a decade ago is something I’m not prepared for. Though I’ve forgiven Savannah, I’ve never forgotten what she did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time to confront the secret she’s kept from me. Though it won’t be easy, I’m determined to make things right between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night together is all it takes for our feelings to come rushing back. As memories of us flood in, truths are finally revealed. When the present collides with our past, I’ll do anything to win her back, even when Savannah tries to run again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I’ll stop at nothing for a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**Forever Mine is a 35k word novella that introduces you to the Roommate Duet Series. It's suggested to read before Baby Mine, but can be read anytime throughout the series.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shadow and Bone is the first installment in Leigh Bardugo's Grisha Trilogy.</description>

  <description>Have you ever set out to have a one night stand with a sexy stranger?&lt;br /&gt;No? I’m the only one?&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding, I would never. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Not usually. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then I figured, why not? My entire life I’ve been good and it’s gotten me nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;No job. &lt;br /&gt;No apartment. &lt;br /&gt;No boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m owed a little fun, aren’t I? A reward for being good.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, a new pair of shoes would be more appropriate, but Mr. Sexy Stranger is more appealing. And when he speaks—in that British accent—it’s a done deal. Every American woman has a hot British guy fantasy. Well, most do. I haven't taken a poll or anything, but I’m pretty sure it’s a fact. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except… &lt;br /&gt;You know that saying about best-laid plans? &lt;br /&gt;Good, because I don’t either, but I assume they go awry.&lt;br /&gt;Like my one night stand…</description>

Hey, just realized this is two audiobooks in a row that the main character was named Violet! Although in this story, she had to go by the name Daisy, because she was pretending to be her twin.

  <description>Nova Lane is having the worst week possible. Her latest relationship ended while on her much-needed vacation, then upon her first day back at work, she learns that her beloved boss has quit – and despite having worked so hard for it, she’s not being considered for his position. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who is being considered for the position is none other than Kessler Rocha. Her ex-coworker and ex-lover, Kessler’s the man who broke her heart five years earlier and the reason she moved thousands of miles away, switched jobs, and created numerous voodoo dolls in Kessler’s (very burly, very handsome) liking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yup. Worst week ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New in town and on her turf, Kessler promises he’s not the same man he was – and considering he’s now a single father to a precocious toddler, he’s telling the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s still an arrogant and devilishly charming man who’s taking over the position Nova feels she deserves. The fact that he’s gotten even more sexy over the years doesn’t help either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Nova and Kessler have the choice to let bygones be bygones, or fight with each other every chance they get, with unresolved sexual tension only adding fuel to the flames, creating a fire that might just burn down the whole office. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the corporate world they say it’s just business, nothing personal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nova and Kessler are about to show just how personal things can get.</description>

      <![CDATA[ The first book I read by this author was Smut, and I loved it. But I also enjoyed The Artists trilogy, even though it was much darker. This book is back along the lines of Smut, light, funny, and just plain fun. And once again, I loved it! I love how realistic the reactions were of the character...]]>

  <description>7 hours, 16 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no rule in the Man Code as unbreakable as this: no matter how beautiful, smart, clever, and witty she is, &lt;b&gt;do not—under any circumstances—fall in love with your best friend’s woman.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah. So there’s that. Look, it’s not like I didn’t know I screwed up by falling for her. &lt;br /&gt;Also, for the record, unrequited love sucks big time.&lt;br /&gt;And, I might have cut myself some slack by now, given everything that went down in the last few years, but Lulu just walked back into my life in a big way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;There are three things I've never been able to resist—&lt;b&gt;my friends, my family, and chocolate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo Hennessy? He was nowhere on that list. He's been a true friend—a friend who walked through hell and back with me.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I'm stepping into my new future. I didn't expect it to include a riddle-filled, race-against-the-clock scavenger hunt across New York City.&lt;br /&gt;With Leo.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I'm looking at this man with new eyes...&lt;br /&gt;But my life spun out because of a man once before, and I can’t risk my fresh start, no matter what the temptation. &lt;b&gt;And Leo is most definitely a temptation of the sexiest, sweetest, and most dangerous variety. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More irresistibly delicious than chocolate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This audiobook is performed by: Andi Arndt (Lulu), Sebastian York (Leo), Erin Mallon (Ginny), R.C. Bray (George), January Lavoy (Kingsley), Dion Graham (Cameron), Shane East (Dean), Jason Clarke (Tripp), Joe Arden (Noah), Julia Whelan (Tabitha), Robin Miles (Mariana and Vivian), and Savannah Peachwood (RaeLynn).</description>

      <![CDATA[So this book had a full cast of narrators, almost one for every main character! That was definitely fun, but you could tell it was also definitely written for this type of an audiobook. It was a lot of fun to listen to it this way, and of course to swoon over Sebastian York's voice. Although ther...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this eerie and suspenseful YA, a teen girl discovers what connects her to the hotel she calls home as horrifying visions lead her to the truth. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nell Martin is moving again, this time to the Winslow Grand Hotel, built in 1878. As Nell is settling in, strange things begin to happen. Doors lock of their own accord, writing appears on bathroom walls--and most horrifying of all--visions of a dead boy permeate her waking life. Thinking it was her mind playing tricks on her, she soon finds the past and the present colliding as she learns horrific details of a murder that happened at the hotel in 1905 involving a girl named Lea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nell and a mysterious bellboy must relive that day in hopes of finally breaking a curse that imprisons them both. And Nell discovers what truly links her to the history of the Winslow Grand Hotel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy concludes with Sinful Empire!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s mine, I keep, and that includes Keira Kilgore.&lt;br /&gt;It’s no longer enough to have her in my debt. No longer enough to own her body.&lt;br /&gt;I want something more.&lt;br /&gt;She can try to resist, but I’ll never give her up.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt;Not her. Not my enemies. No one.&lt;br /&gt;Her debt will only be paid one way—with her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt; is the third and final book in the Mount Trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 8 hrs</description>

      <![CDATA[Meghan March made me love the really, really, really bad guy. Even if his "bad" was in a way, kinda good. So this one started up not exactly right where the last one left off, which would normally be frustrating seeing as how the last one ended on a cliffhanger. However it wasn't, because we got...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy continues with &lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m his entertainment. His toy. Payment on a debt.&lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I hate him, but every time he walks into the room, my body betrays me. How can I want him and fear him in the same moment?&lt;br /&gt;They told me he’d mess with my head. Make it go to war with my body.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t realize it would be complete anarchy.&lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known better. When Mount’s involved, there are no rules.&lt;br /&gt;I will not surrender. I will not show weakness. I’ll stand my ground and make it out of this bargain with my heart and soul intact.&lt;br /&gt;But he has other plans . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira's story concludes in &lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 5 hrs and 27 mins</description>

  <description>Get ready for the darker and dirtier side of New Orleans with a brand new alpha romance from USA Today bestselling author Meghan March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans belongs to me. &lt;br /&gt;You don’t know my name, but I control everything you see—and all the things you don’t. &lt;br /&gt;My reach knows no bounds, and my demands are always met. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t need to loan money to a failing family distillery, but it amuses me to have them in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;To have her in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t know she caught my attention. &lt;br /&gt;She should’ve been more careful. &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to own her. Consume her. Maybe even keep her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to collect what I’m owed. &lt;br /&gt;Keira Kilgore, you’re now the property of Lachlan Mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ruthless King is book 1 of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira’s story is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2017 with Defiant Queen and Sinful Empire.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My dick never got me in half as much trouble as my heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were high school sweethearts. I was head over heels for her and no one could tell me we weren’t going to last forever. College? Going pro? My family’s money? None of it mattered. She was all I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she ripped my heart out. But I’m not going to let that happen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s back. Invading my life and acting like she was the wronged one. The pain is still there, but I can’t keep my eyes off her. I can’t stop thinking about her and how much was left unsaid between us. Being this close is making me question everything I thought I knew about her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time everything will be on my terms. Everything…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I'm here to take you to live with your father. In Tokyo, Japan! Happy birthday!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Land of the Rising Sun, where high culture meets high kitsch, and fashion and technology are at the forefront of the First World's future, the foreign-born teen elite attend ICS-the International Collegiate School of Tokyo. Their accents are fluid. Their homes are ridiculously posh. Their sports games often involve a (private) plane trip to another country. They miss school because of jet lag and visa issues. When they get in trouble, they seek diplomatic immunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter foster-kid-out-of-water Elle Zoellner, who, on her sixteenth birthday discovers that her long-lost father, Kenji Takahari, is actually a Japanese hotel mogul and wants her to come live with him. Um, yes, please! Elle jets off first class from Washington D.C. to Tokyo, which seems like a dream come true. Until she meets her enigmatic father, her way-too-fab aunt, and her hyper-critical grandmother, who seems to wish Elle didn't exist. In an effort to please her new family, Elle falls in with the Ex-Brats, a troupe of uber-cool international kids who spend money like it's air. But when she starts to crush on a boy named Ryuu, who's frozen out by the Brats and despised by her new family, her already tenuous living situation just might implode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Almost Flawless Tokyo Dream Life is about learning what it is to be a family, and finding the inner strength to be yourself, even in the most extreme circumstances.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The history books say I died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don’t know the half of it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anastasia “Nastya” Romanov was given a single mission: to smuggle an ancient spell into her suitcase on her way to exile in Siberia. It might be her family’s only salvation. But the leader of the Bolshevik army is after them, and he’s hunted Romanov before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nastya’s only chances of saving herself and her family are to either release the spell and deal with the consequences, or enlist help from Zash, the handsome soldier who doesn’t act like the average Bolshevik. Nastya has only dabbled in magic, but it doesn’t frighten her half as much as her growing attraction to Zash. She likes him. She thinks he might even like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she’s on one side of a firing squad . . . and he’s on the other.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout comes the next installment in her Wicked series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Caden and Brighton's attraction grows despite the odds stacked against a happily ever after, they must work together to stop an Ancient fae from releasing the Queen, who wants nothing more than to see Caden become the evil Prince once feared by fae and mortals alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

The lengths that the author lets her characters go to, their suffering, their emotions, their connections, their daring, these are the reasons that Armentrout wins me over with each new book.

  <description>When Evelyn Dasher crossed paths with Luc, she was thrown headfirst into the world of the Lux—only to discover that she was already far more involved in their world than she ever suspected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Luxen aren’t the only ones with a hidden past. There’s a gap in Evie’s memory, lost months of her life and a lingering sense that something happened, something she can’t remember and nobody is willing to tell her. She needs to find out the truth about who she is—and who she was. But every answer she finds only brings up more questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her search for the truth brings her ever closer to Luc, the Origin at the center of it all. He’s powerful, arrogant, inhumanly beautiful, extremely dangerous…and possibly in love with her. But even as Evie falls for him, she can’t help but wonder if his attraction is to her, or to the memory of a girl who no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the while, a new threat looms: reports of a flu-like, fatal virus that the government insists is being spread by Luxen. A horrifying illness that changes whoever it touches, spreading panic across a country already at its breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times, USA Today, &lt;/i&gt;and internationally bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout returns to the world of the Lux with this steamy, shocking second installment of the Origin series that will leave readers reeling.</description>

  <description>9 hours, 7 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For two sworn enemies, anything can happen during the Hawaiian trip of a lifetime—even love—in this witty and swoonworthy romance from the&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling duo who “hilariously depict modern dating” (&lt;i&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) and authors of &lt;i&gt;Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roomies&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Amy, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of...lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Christina Lauren’s “uniquely hilarious and touching voice” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;The Unhoneymooners &lt;/i&gt;is a fun and charming romance that is perfect for anyone who has ever felt unlucky in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brilliantly funny, scorchingly sexy new romance from #1 New York Times bestselling author Lauren Blakely!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Picture this - I’m ready to win back the love of my life, and I’m going big this time.&lt;/b&gt; We’re talking boom box, sing her name in the rain, let the whole damn neighborhood know I'm good and ready this time around. After all, if you're going to grand gesture the ever-loving hell out of a second chance, you need to pull out all the stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one little problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My college girlfriend isn't the one who shows up when I play my "I'll do anything to win you back" tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman who flings open the second-floor window tells me my ex doesn’t live here anymore. But she'll help me win her back. Anything for romance, anything for a guy so willing to go big for love. And that's what I want at first. Until I get to know my new “romance coach” and discover she’s funny, clever, and keeps me on my toes. And boy, do I ever need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don't want to win anyone else’s heart. I want the woman who's been helping me all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trouble is - she thinks I'm in love with someone else, and when we take off on a road trip, everything I think I know about women is about to be unzipped and turned inside out.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 7 hours, 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Bestselling authors of Stuck-Up Suit and Mister Moneybags, comes a new, sexy &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Bridget,&lt;br /&gt;I'm writing this letter because it's highly doubtful I'll ever garner the courage to say this to your face.&lt;br /&gt;So, here goes.&lt;br /&gt;We're totally wrong for each other. You're the proper single mum with a good head on your shoulders. I'm just the carefree British doctor passing through town and temporarily living in your converted garage until I head back to England.&lt;br /&gt;But here's the thing... for some bloody reason, I can't stop thinking about you in very inappropriate ways.&lt;br /&gt;I want you.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I'm even admitting all of this to you right now is because I don't believe it's one-sided. I notice your eyes when you look at me, too. And as crass as I appear when we're joking around about sex, my attraction to you is not a joke.&lt;br /&gt;So, what's the purpose of this note? I guess it's a reminder that we're adults, that sex is healthy and natural, and that you can find me just through the door past the kitchen. More specifically, it's to let you know that I'm leaving said door cracked open from now on in case you'd like to visit me in the middle of the night sometime.&lt;br /&gt;No questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;Think about it.&lt;br /&gt;Or don't.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you choose.&lt;br /&gt;It's doubtful I'll even end up sliding this letter under your door anyway.&lt;br /&gt;--Simon</description>

      <![CDATA[This book had one of the best beginnings. I loved the fish hook in the butt! As I listened to this, it made me think about how I need to try to start any books I write that way if I want to get people reading. So much that I could relate to, even though I'm not a single mother. There was the part...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time ever, the beloved songs from &lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; are collected here in a charmingly-illustrated treasury, sure to be cherished by adults who grew up with Mister Rogers, and a new generation of children alike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; had a revolutionary impact on children's television, and on millions of children themselves. Through songs, puppets, and frank conversations, Mister Rogers instilled the values of kindness, patience, and self-esteem in his viewers, and most of all, taught children how loved they were, just by being themselves. &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; reimagines the songs from the show as poetry, ranging from the iconic ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") to the forgotten gems. The poem are funny, sweet, silly, and sincere, dealing with topics of difficult feelings, new siblings, everyday routines, imagination, and more. Perfect for bedtime, sing-along, or quiet time, this book of nostalgic and meaningful poetry is the perfect gift for every child--including the child in all of us.</description>

      <![CDATA[As the synopsis points out, this book really made me so nostalgic. So many of the songs/poems that were in the book I could hear being recited or sung in Mister Rogers' voice. I recently saw the documentary about Mister Rogers, and this book is coming out at the perfect time to tie in with those...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What fate awaits a girl who hears monsters at night…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Jaclyn looks up to her father. An honest man who once fought for the king, he now teaches Jaclyn how to use her wits—and her sword. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he has a secret. And his secret may have a connection to the one thing Jaclyn is hiding from him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon hearing “monsters” are terrorizing the small villages around Black Mountain, Jaclyn’s father and his friends head out to hunt them … but they don’t return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed only with her sword and three magic beans—a gift from a mysterious old woman—Jaclyn sets out for Black Mountain to save her father. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her climb, one bean drops and grows into a beanstalk, catching her when she falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn’t the only one that takes the ride. Jack, her childhood friend and secret crush, is following her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaclyn and Jack will have to work together to save not only their fathers, but the townspeople the beasts plan to lay waste to before it’s too late.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had read another book in the series, True to You, and really enjoyed it. Although in that story, I had trouble with something the guy, Asher, had done to the girl, Olivia, and so that kept me from being able to give it 5 stars. But the couple in this book, Jason and Tessa, well I got all of the...]]>

  <description>Mia's best friend Robyn is known for her matchmaking skills, which is perfect, because homecoming is just around the corner. But Robyn refuses to set Mia up with the guy of her dreams, which forces Mia to take matters into her own hands. She uses Robyn's matchmaking service to make sure popular Vince Demetrius falls for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vince asks her out, but Mia doesn't count on Logan, the persistent school newspaper photographer who seems to like her out of the blue. Now she has to choose between Vince - the guy she knows is right for her - and Logan, who insists that she give him a chance. And she needs to make sure Robyn doesn't find out that Mia's been matchmaking behind her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia has two weeks before homecoming. Can she fix the mess she made or will she have to kiss her perfect match goodbye forever?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book grabbed me from the very first page. It was cute and funny, and in a lot of ways, very realistic for teenagers. There was a point late in the book when I was thinking how much drama the characters were adding to the whole thing, but I can't complain about a teen book having teens acting...]]>

  <description>It's been a year since fifteen-year-old Mia Hopkins was in the car crash that killed her older sister and left her terribly scarred. The doctors tell her she was lucky to survive. Her therapist says it will take time to heal. The police reports claim there were trace amounts of alcohol in her bloodstream. But no matter how much she tries to reconstruct the events of that fateful night, Mia's memory is spotty at best. She's left with accusations, rumors, and guilt so powerful it could consume her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the rest of Mia's family struggles with their own grief, Mia is sent to New York City to spend the summer with a grandmother she's never met. All Mia wants to do is hide from the world, but instead she's stuck with a summer job in the bustling kitchens of the cafe down the street. There she meets Fig--blue-haired, friendly, and vivacious--who takes Mia under her wing. As Mia gets to know Fig and her friends--including Cooper, the artistic boy who is always on Mia's mind--she realizes that she's not the only one with a painful past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the summer, Mia begins to learn that redemption isn't as impossible as she once thought, but her scars inside run deep and aren't nearly so simple to heal ... especially when Mia finally pieces together her memories of the night Rachel died.</description>

  <description>How do you date your best friend's sister? Easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one: Pretend you want her to set you up with someone else. That will bring the two of you closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two: Go on date with lots of random women, proceed to get stupid drunk and talk about your best friend's sister, thus gaining the courage to finally make a move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step three: Randomly show up at her apartment and confess your love. Women love that, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all seemed so simple. A fool-proof three step process that will guarantee the love of you life to fall madly in love with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least--that's what I thought was going to happen. But my attempts to win over Julia Westin backfired in more ways than I can count. The thing about Julia? She's smart--really smart--and her wicked gaze cuts through all the charm I've tried slinging her way. She's not interested in games, my gifts, or my stories. She might want me too; but she's not giving in that easy...</description>

  <description>I haven’t left my house in over a year. My doctor says it’s social anxiety, but I know the only things that are safe are made of paper. My room is paper. My world is paper. Everything outside is fire. All it would take is one spark for me to burst into flames. So I stay inside. Where nothing can touch me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my mom hires a tutor. Jackson. This boy I had a crush on before the world became too terrifying to live in. Jackson’s life is the complete opposite of mine, and I can tell he’s got secrets of his own. But he makes me feel things. Makes me want to try again. Makes me want to be brave. I can almost taste the outside world. But so many things could go wrong, and all it takes is one spark for everything I love to disappear…</description>

  <description>A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Road&lt;/b&gt; is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, "each the other's world entire," are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.</description>

  <description>Lights flicker on and off for no good reason. You feel drained and inexplicably irritable. Your four-year-old is scared to enter her bedroom. &lt;br /&gt;Tell these things to Mary Ann Winkowski, and she'll tell you that you have a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;A happily married, devout Catholic, suburban mother and full-time paranormal investigator, Mary Ann Winkowski has been able to see earthbound spirits, spirits that are trapped on earth and haven't "crossed over," since she was a little girl. Mary Ann works with these spirits to help them make peace with what keeps them here - whether it be people they can't let go of or homes they love. &lt;br /&gt;In WHEN GHOSTS SPEAK, Mary Ann will tell the amazing story of growing up with this gift, and will share tips on how to recognize when you're not alone, and what to do if you are in the presence of a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the #1 "New York Times" bestselling master of suspense comes a riveting thriller that probes the deepest terrors of the human psyche--and the ineffable mystery of what truly makes us who we are. Here a brilliant young man finds himself fighting for his very existence in a battle that starts with the most frightening words of all... &lt;br /&gt;At thirty-four, Internet entrepreneur Ryan Perry seemed to have the world in his pocket--until the first troubling symptoms appeared out of nowhere. Within days, he's diagnosed with incurable cardiomyopathy and finds himself on the waiting list for a heart transplant; it's his only hope, and it's dwindling fast. Ryan is about to lose it all...his health, his girlfriend Samantha, and his life. &lt;br /&gt;One year later, Ryan has never felt better. Business is good and he hopes to renew his relationship with Samantha. Then the unmarked gifts begin to appear--a box of Valentine candy hearts, a heart pendant. Most disturbing of all, a graphic heart surgery video and the chilling message: "Your heart belongs to me." &lt;br /&gt;In a heartbeat, the medical miracle that gave Ryan a second chance at life is about to become a curse worse than death. For Ryan is being stalked by a mysterious woman who feels entitled to everything he has. She's the spitting image of the twenty-six-year-old donor of the heart beating steadily in Ryan's own chest. &lt;br /&gt;And she's come to take it back.</description>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Stewart Hale dreams of Space Academy and becoming a famous pilot like his mother, and like his hero Val Thorsten. But after his mother’s death, his father has forbidden any talk of Stewart going into space. And Stewart suspects there’s something that is being kept hidden from him, something they don’t want him to remember from his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A chance encounter with a washed-up old spacer gives Stewart an unexpected opportunity to sneak off on his own mission to the Moon. But when the old spacer’s intentions turn out to be less than honorable, Stewart realizes he hasn’t found his big break—he’s been shanghaied!</description>

  <description>Lexi wakes up in a hospital bed after a car accident, thinking it's 2004 and she's a twenty-five-year old with crooked teeth and a disastrous love life. But, to her disbelief, she learns it's actually 2007 - she's twenty-eight, her teeth are straight, she's the boss of her department - and she's married! To a good-looking millionaire! How on earth did she land the dream life??! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can't believe her luck - especially when she sees her stunning new home. She's sure she'll have a fantastic marriage once she gets to know her husband again. He's drawn up a 'manual of our marriage,' which should help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she learns more about her new self, chinks start to appear in the perfect life. All her old colleagues hate her. A rival is after her job. Then a dishevelled, sexy guy turns up...and lands a new bombshell. What happened to her? Will she ever remember? And what will happen if she does?</description>

  <description>For fans of television shows &lt;i&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Westworld, &lt;/i&gt; this compelling, mind-bending novel is a twisted look into the future, exploring how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimen and what it means to be human at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in our world, spanning the near to distant futures, &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is a novel made up of six interconnected stories that ask how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimens, and how hard that will push the definition of "human."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extraordinary work explores the amazing possibilities of genetic manipulation and life extension, as well as the ethical quandaries that will arise with these advances. The results range from the heavenly to the monstrous. Deeply thoughtful, poignant, horrifying, and action-packed, Arwen Elys Dayton's &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is groundbreaking in both form and substance.</description>

  <description>High school finally behind her, Winnie is all set to attend college in the fall. But first she's spending her summer days working at her granny’s diner and begins spending her midnights with Dallas—the boy she loves to hate and hates that she likes. Winnie lives in Misty Haven, a small town where secrets are impossible to keep—like when Winnie allegedly snaps on Dr. Skinner, which results in everyone feeling compelled to give her weight loss advice for her own good. Because they care that’s she’s “too fat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winnie dreams of someday inheriting the diner—but it'll go away if they can't make money, and fast. Winnie has a solution—win a televised cooking competition and make bank. But Granny doesn't want her to enter—so Winnie has to find a way around her formidable grandmother. Can she come out on top?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A compelling novel about speaking out, standing up, and breaking free -- perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam lives in New Jerusalem, a haven in the desert far away from the sins and depravity of the outside world. Within the gates of New Jerusalem, and under the eye of its founder and leader, Daniel, Miriam knows she is safe. Cared for. Even if she's forced, as a girl, to quiet her tongue when she has thoughts she wants to share, Miriam knows that New Jerusalem is a far better life than any alternative. So when God calls for a Matrimony, she's thrilled; she knows that Caleb, the boy she loves, will choose her to be his wife and they can finally start their life together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the ceremony goes wrong and Miriam winds up with someone else, she can no longer keep quiet. For the first time, Miriam begins to question not only the rules that Daniel has set in place, but also what it is she believes in, and where she truly belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alongside unexpected allies, Miriam fights to learn--and challenge--the truth behind the only way of life she's ever known, even if it means straying from the path of Righteousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compelling debut novel about speaking out, standing up, and breaking free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Virtue of Sin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Shannon Schuren weaves a complex tale of love, faith, and lies in her thought-provoking debut&lt;i&gt; The Virtue of Sin&lt;/i&gt;. As important as it is entertaining, this is a must-read for anyone who knows that independent thought trumps fitting in. One of my favorite reads of the year." --Christina Dalcher, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>TEQUILA + YOUR BEST FRIEND + YOUR BEDROOM = UM. WHOOPSIE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t sleep with your best friend. &lt;br /&gt;Take it from me. I did it. And it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;I-wish-the-tequila-made-me-forget kind of bad.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Luke has forgotten. He swears that he can’t remember a thing about that night beyond the trays of tequila shots being set on the tables. &lt;br /&gt;Except I can't forget. I can’t forget how good his hands felt until I fell over and hit my hip on the dresser, and I sure as hell can’t forget the entire two minutes of tap-tap-squirt.&lt;br /&gt;Awkward. Embarrassing. And the new subject of a couple of dirty lucid dreams.&lt;br /&gt;But I have no intention of telling him what we did. Nothing good comes from telling your best friend he’s the worst guy you’ve ever slept with.&lt;br /&gt;Which makes the tequila on my birthday a very, very bad idea…</description>

Even all the things that usually annoy me in stories, the not telling someone when you should tell them, even with those kind of standard story aspects, this is going to be one of my all time favorite books.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From some of your favorite bestselling and critically acclaimed authors—including Sandhya Menon, Anna-Marie McLemore, and Rin Chupeco—comes a collection of interconnected short stories that explore the intersection of family, culture, and food in the lives of thirteen teens.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shy teenager attempts to express how she really feels through the confections she makes at her family’s pasteleria. A tourist from Montenegro desperately seeks a magic soup dumpling that could cure his fear of death. An aspiring chef realizes that butter and soul are the key ingredients to win a cooking competition that could win him the money to save his mother’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Hungry Hearts Row, where the answers to most of life’s hard questions are kneaded, rolled, baked. Where a typical greeting is, “Have you had anything to eat?” Where magic and food and love are sometimes one and the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in interconnected short stories, Hungry Hearts explores the many meanings food can take on beyond mere nourishment. It can symbolize love and despair, family and culture, belonging and home.</description>

  <description>When he wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close at my brother’s wedding, my heart beat faster. When we danced into the night, my mind raced far ahead, entertaining all the possibilities I’d longed for. And later, when Cooper told me he’d won the starting quarterback job before he shared the news with anyone else, I started to believe we could be more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t want to lose him as a friend, so I chose to focus on him solely as my buddy. That worked well enough for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until that night, in front of everyone, when he shocked my world to its core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most Irresistible Guy&lt;/i&gt; is a prequel novella to &lt;i&gt;Most Valuable Playboy&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a very mini-review. It was a novella, but an awesome prequel to a series I now need to go on and read. I loved getting Violet's take on her crush on Cooper, and how she'd just given up, knowing he probably wasn't interested, even though at times he might be a bit more flirty than seemed j...]]>

  <description>When Dee Dawson meets sexy mohawked guitarist Joel Gibbon, she knows it won’t be long before she has him wrapped around her finger. No guy has ever been able to resist her… but Dee’s met her match in a player like Joel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee’s not the relationship type—not after seeing the pain “love” has caused her friends and family—yet she’s desperate to make Joel want her more than anyone else. He quickly becomes an obsession, and when a reckless attempt to make him jealous ends in disaster, Dee turns into the damsel in distress she never wanted to be. With her carefree world crashing down around her, the last thing she needs is Joel’s pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Joel is suddenly determined to prove he cares, and no matter how hard Dee tries to push him away, he refuses to let her shut him out. Now the girl who swore she’d never say those three little words must choose between guarding her heart and losing Joel forever… or falling head-over-heels for the tattooed rock star of her dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Half-Blood&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Antigoddess&lt;/i&gt; in a thrilling, romantic new series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Brenda Drake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a stranger gives Analiese Jordan a list of names before he dies, the last thing she expects to see is her own on it. Not. Cool. Her search for answers leads to the man’s grandson, Marek, who has dangerous secrets of his own. Both are determined to unlock the mystery of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth is deadly. Analiese is a descendant of the God of Death, known as a Riser, with the power to raise the dead and control them. Finding out she has hidden powers? Cool. Finding out she turns corpses into killers? No, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the trail plants her and Marek in the middle of a war between gods who apparently want to raise an army of the Risen, and Analiese must figure out how to save the world—from herself.</description>

  <description>Kip Carmichael is no pretty boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a rough. Dirty. Giant. Hair so unruly, and a beard so thick, his friends on the team call him Sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time Sasquatch lays eyes on Theodora "Teddy" Johnson across the keg at a party one night on Jock Row, she'd been relegated to the sidelines by her jock hungry "friends."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week-after-week, he watches beautiful but bashful Teddy getting overshadowed, and overlooked. Sasquatch finally broad shoulders his way through the crowd, offering to to be her hairy godmother. But the minute their eyes meet? He's a goner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaching her the RULES for winning a jock will be the easy part. Not falling in love with her is going to be a losing game.</description>

  <description>“The carnage began with the roses. She hacked at their ruffled blooms until they dropped into monstrous drifts of red on the parched yellow lawn … Only two things kept my mother grounded to us: my uncle Stephen and stories.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen-year-old Molly worries about school, friends, and her parents’ failed marriage, but mostly about her mother’s growing depression. Molly knows her mother is nursing a carefully-kept secret. A writer with an obsession for other people’s life stories, Elaine Donnelly is the poster child of repressed emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly spends her California summer alternately watching out for her little brother Angus and tip-toeing around her mother’s raw feelings. Molly needs her mother more than ever, but Elaine shuts herself off from real human connections and buries herself in the lives and deaths of the strangers she writes about. When Uncle Stephen is pressed into the limelight because of his miracle cure of a young man, Elaine can no longer hide behind other people’s stories. And as Molly digs into her mother’s past, she finds a secret hidden in her mother’s dresser that may be the key to unlocking a family mystery dating to 1918 New York—a secret that could destroy or save their future.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince and his fairy courtiers are staggeringly beautiful, unrelentingly cruel, and exhausted by the tedium of the centuries ― until they meet foster-siblings Josh and Ksenia. Drawn in by their vivid emotions, undying love for each other, and passion for life, Prince will stop at nothing to possess them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First seduced and then entrapped by the fairies, Josh and Ksenia learn that the fairies' otherworldly gifts come at a terrible price ― and they must risk everything in order to reclaim their freedom.</description>

  <description>Nothing much happens in the sleepy town of Shy in Avon-upon-Kynt. And for eighteen years, Emmaline Watkins has feared that her future held just that: nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the head of the most admired fashion house in the country opens her prestigious design competition to girls from outside the stylish capital city, Emmy’s dreams seem closer than they ever have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the first “country girl” to compete, Emmy knows she’ll encounter extra hurdles on her way to the top. But as she navigates the twisted world of high fashion she starts to wonder: will she be able to tailor herself to fit into this dark, corrupted race? And at what cost?</description>

      <![CDATA[While the idea behind the story wasn't that original and unique, it was a really good story despite that. I really liked the characters and the world that the story took place in. It was also a lot of fun to try to imagine these beautiful dresses described in my head as I was reading. This is one...]]>

  <description>What happens when the cute mountain man you made out with in an ice fishing shack turns out to be your brother’s best friend? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole lot of awkward, that’s what. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie’s mind is reeling when she discovers the guy she became tangled up with at Marv’s Bait &amp;amp; Tackle isn’t a stranger like she thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big snag: Sam and Maggie’s chemistry is hot enough to melt ice, which makes keeping their secret far more difficult than either expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when one of them decides they want this arrangement to be more than just a catch and release.</description>

  <description>A serialized story from Sarina Bowen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 1016 people in the freshman class at Harkness College. I can’t be the only socially awkward nerd girl virgin among them. Right?&lt;br /&gt;It’s time I learn to talk to guys without blushing and stammering. So I take a confidence-building job at the student tutoring center. Twelve bucks an hour, plus human interaction. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;A fun-loving French Canadian hockey hunk, that’s what.&lt;br /&gt;When Pepe Gerault sits down at my tutoring table, my brain shuts off and my mouth goes right into hyperdrive. Even the sound of my name on his lips—Josephine—gives me a mini orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;I want to hand him my V-card. But all I manage to hand him is…my thesaurus. And my dignity. All seems lost, until I hatch a plan to get him alone…&lt;br /&gt;Get it only in Sarina's newsletter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you sign up after the serialization has already begun, your first email will contain links to all the existing chapters. You won't miss a thing!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Born into a strictly religious family, nineteen-year-old Lucy Whitman likes to think she's gotten past her stifling upbringing. After all, she's not a virgin. But when her best guy friend of ten years admits he's part of a community with an "open-door policy" on sex, Lucy is intrigued. She's always wanted Rylan with a fierceness bordering on obsession, but he has never treated her as anything other than a sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting him to agree to take her may be her only shot at having him in her bed, but Rylan's reluctant agreement comes with three stipulations. &lt;br /&gt; One: she can't tell anyone. &lt;br /&gt; Two: she'll have to be okay with him being her main partner, even if it's completely weird for them both. &lt;br /&gt; Three: she has to do anything he tells her to-no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy knows promising to obey is her best chance to venture outside the box. Now if she can only find the courage to let go of her inhibitions, she'll have the perfect opportunity to discover her true self while going after exactly what she wants-Ry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*All Open-Door Policy novellas can be read as standalones.*</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Life leads you to unexpected places. Love brings you home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashlyn Zanotti has big plans for the summer. She's just spent a year at boarding school and can't wait to get home. But when Ashlyn's father is arrested for tax evasion and her mother enters a rehab facility for "exhaustion," a.k.a. depression, her life is turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on top? Ashlyn's father sends her to work with a cousin she doesn't even know at a rustic team-building retreat center in the middle of nowhere. A self-proclaimed "indoor girl," not even Ash's habit of leaving breadcrumb quotes—inspirational sayings she scribbles everywhere—can help her cope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dangerously careless camp manager doling out grunt work, an overbearing father trying to control her even from prison, and more than a little boy drama to struggle with, the summer is full of challenges. And Ashlyn must make the toughest decision of her life: keep quiet and follow her dad's marching orders, or find the courage to finally stand up to her father to have any hope of finding her way back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Christina June, author of &lt;em&gt;It Started with Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Everywhere You Want to Be&lt;/em&gt;, comes &lt;em&gt;No Place Like Here&lt;/em&gt;, a modern twist on Hansel and Gretel. </description>

  <description>Stephen King is arguably the most popular novelist in the history of American fiction. He owes his fans a love letter. &lt;i&gt;Misery&lt;/i&gt; is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Sheldon, author of a bestselling series of historical romances, wakes up one winter day in a strange place, a secluded farmhouse in Colorado. He wakes up to unspeakable pain (a dislocated pelvis, a crushed knee, two shattered legs) and to a bizarre greeting from the woman who has saved his life: "I'm your number one fan!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Wilkes is a huge ex-nurse, handy with controlled substances and other instruments of abuse, including an axe and a blowtorch. A dangerous psychotic with a &lt;i&gt;Romper Room&lt;/i&gt; sense of good and bad, fair and unfair, Annie Wilkes may be Stephen King's most terrifying creation. It's not fair, for example, that her favorite character in the world, Misery Chastain, has been killed by her creator, as Annie discovers when Paul's latest novel comes out in paperback. And it's not good that her favorite writer has been a Don't-Bee and written a different kind of novel, a &lt;i&gt;nasty&lt;/i&gt; novel, the novel he has always wanted to write, the only copy of which now lies in Annie's angry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because she wants Paul Sheldon to be a Do-Bee, she buys him a typewriter and a ream of paper and tells him to bring Misery back to life. Wheelchair-bound, drug-dependent, locked in his room, Paul doesn't have much choice. He's an entertainer held captive by his audience. A writer in serious trouble. But writers have weapons too...&lt;br /&gt;--jacket flap</description>

  <description>ABIGAIL DARLINGTON IS AWKWARD… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She will never be “that” girl. You know the one: that girl on campus, confident in her own skin. Always saying the right things. Putting herself out there. Knows how to talk to a guy without stammering. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope. Shy but clever, and easily embarrassed, Abby is fine being the wallflower in her circle of outgoing, beautiful friends; she would rather read about a sexy book boyfriend than actually have a live, breathing one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…BUT CALEB LOCKHART IS WORSE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Star goaltender for the University’s hockey team, Caleb is quiet and broody, preferring the solitude of his orderly, regimented life. He doesn’t like, or need people—and plans to keep it that way. One more year left of hockey and he’ll be long gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AWKWARD NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both their lives change the day that Abigail falls for Caleb. Well, falls directly on top of him, to be accurate. Because sometimes we don’t settle into love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We fall there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This book contains cursing, and LOTS of it. It also has sex, uncomfortable sexual situations, and secondary characters who say some really inappropriate shit. RATING: R</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5 stars. This book actually made me think that maybe I should give shy guys a little more of a chance. But the awkwardness that the two faced in this book is so much what I dread and have dealt with in my own life as a shy person on a date with a shy guy. Unfortunately the shy guys I went out w...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Trust me - If there's one thing I'm not attracted to, it's an arrogant, selfish and foul-mouth hockey player. I know what I want, and Matthew Wakefield isn't it." &lt;b&gt;- Cecelia Carter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first moment they laid eyes on each other, all Cecelia Carter and Matthew Wakefield do is bicker. Fight. Even though he is her roommates brother, Cece just can't stand the sight of him, and Matthew - well. He could never resist a challenge... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That can't be a good combination, can it? &lt;br /&gt;But sometimes, love happens when you least expect it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is intended for those 17 and older - If you're offended by "F" bombs, sarcasm, sexual situations and Alpha Male jackasses - this book is not for you... &lt;/i&gt;</description>

While he was definitely pretty much whipped/in love, whatever you want to call it, he was still an annoying boy. I laughed so hard out loud so many times during this boo...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will she, or won't she... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studious and (mostly) sensible, the only thing Molly Wakefield wants to do is get through Senior Year and graduate. Well, that and hit the beach in her spare time. Okay, fine - and go shopping every once in a while for a new dress... (and who could blame her?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And things are going according to plan - until the day she spies Weston McGrath, handsome star athlete and scholar, spying on her in study hall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad creepy? Maybe. &lt;br /&gt;Thrilling? Absolutely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, Weston McGrath happens to be one guy no one can get close to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her best efforts to avoid it (because let's face it - the guy isn't exactly "boyfriend material") Mollly and Weston form a friendship. &lt;br /&gt;And more.... &lt;br /&gt;Sort of. &lt;br /&gt;But it's a friendship that comes with a price - because Weston just cannot seem to stop screwing things up. Or saying all the wrong things. Possibly in that order... &lt;br /&gt;And who has time for an 18 year old "fixer-upper" that should know better? &lt;br /&gt;Not Molly. &lt;br /&gt;Or does she? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is book one and includes chapter one of book two, &lt;b&gt;Ke Kissed Me First&lt;/b&gt;. This book is a stand-alone with no cliffhanger. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This YA book is intended for 17+ due to the vulgar language used by its male characters (and occasionally the females as well, even though they're too lady like to do it throughout the entire book). Some adult sexual situations that steam up a few car windows. This title is approx. 63,000 words.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Trinity Marrow may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her unique gift is part of a secret so dangerous that she’s been in hiding for years in an isolated compound fiercely guarded by Wardens—gargoyle shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her, flesh and bone, to enhance their own powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wardens from another clan arrive with disturbing reports that something out there is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s safe world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own that will upend her world yet again—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to put her trust in Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kylie Scott comes a new story in her Stage Dive series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the girl of your dreams is kind of a nightmare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As head of security to Stage Dive, one of the biggest rock bands in the world, Sam Knowles has plenty of experience dealing with trouble. But spoilt brat Martha Nicholson just might be the worst thing he’s ever encountered. The beautiful troublemaker claims to have reformed, but Sam knows better than to think with what’s in his pants. Unfortunately, it’s not so easy to make his heart fall into line. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Martha’s had her sights on the seriously built bodyguard for years. Quiet and conservative, he’s not even remotely her type. So why the hell can’t she get him out of her mind? There’s more to her than the Louboutin wearing party-girl of previous years, however. Maybe it’s time to let him in on that fact and deal with this thing between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The first time the Nightmares came, it nearly cost Alice her life. Now she's trained to battle monstrous creatures in the dark dream realm known as Wonderland with magic weapons and hardcore fighting skills. Yet even warriors have a curfew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in real-world Atlanta isn't always so simple, as Alice juggles an overprotective mom, a high-maintenance best friend, and a slipping GPA. Keeping the Nightmares at bay is turning into a full-time job. But when Alice's handsome and mysterious mentor is poisoned, she has to find the antidote by venturing deeper into Wonderland than she’s ever gone before. And she'll need to use everything she's learned in both worlds to keep from losing her head . . . literally.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars. So, while this one had a really good story, I had a few issues with it. I loved so much of the Buffy aspects of the story. I loved the Alice in Wonderland aspects as well. However, there was just so much to read. So many details and so much that I actually skipped over to just get the...]]>

  <description>Two season tickets. &lt;br /&gt;One genius idea. &lt;br /&gt;Zero interest in a relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plan is simple: a brand new, hot, preferably funny, definitely single male will fill one of those seats for every Bears game at Soldier Field. And I’ll fill the other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can’t think of a better way to use the season passes I’d bought for my ex-husband. I am a woman of plans, and this one’s foolproof. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Zach Bowen offers to be my practice round. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s infuriating. Presumptuous and overbearing. And absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Any woman with a heartbeat would be attracted to him, and mine picks up speed every time he speaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as I said, I’m a woman of plans — and I’m not backing down on this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night. One game. And then, his time’s up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can try to change the rules, but here’s the truth: he can’t win if he’s playing the wrong game. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Wrong Game is a stand-alone, angsty, enemies-to-lovers sports romance. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

When the paparazzi captures her and Perry Gillman in a compromising moment the night of the royal wedding, she finds herself entangled in a scandal of global proportion. Convinced her carelessness has ruined every relationship in her life, she’s surprised and moved by her boyfriend, Gideon’s, sudden proposal of marriage and accepts it without a second thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months later, Gigi’s living at Badgley Hall contemplating an entirely new kind of life while guilt, regret, and obligation keep calling her back to her old one. Will Gigi stay in South Gloucestershire, marry Gideon, and become the Countess of Harronsby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Or, will unfinished opportunities and an old flame bring her back across the pond to confront her past and reclaim her future? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Campfire Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1.

I wasn't necessarily happy to see that Gigi and Gideon had decided to make it work. That she wasn't going to try with Perry, because I really like Perry. But things unf...]]>

  <description>Marlee thought she scored the man of her dreams only to be scorched by a bad breakup. But there's a new player on the horizon, and he's in a league of his own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlee Harper is the perfect girlfriend. She's definitely had enough practice by dating her NFL-star boyfriend for the last ten years. But when she discovers he has been tackling other women on the sly, she vows to never date an athlete again. There's just one problem: Gavin Pope, the new hotshot quarterback and a fling from the past, has Marlee in his sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin fights to show Marlee he's nothing like her ex. Unfortunately, not everyone is ready to let her escape her past. The team's wives, who never led the welcome wagon, are not happy with Marlee's return. They have only one thing on their minds: taking her down. But when the gossip makes Marlee public enemy number one, she worries about more than just her reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between their own fumbles and the wicked wives, it will take a Hail Mary for Marlee and Gavin's relationship to survive the season.</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5 stars. I was hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for this final book to wrap up everything after how the last book ended. You can read my review of the first two books here: Motion and Space. This one began in a way that I was a little unsure if I would love it as much as the other two. Yo...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week.&lt;br /&gt;Private cabin.&lt;br /&gt;Famous physicist.&lt;br /&gt;Still an unrepentant slacker.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona’s meticulously planned allotment of relaxation is thrown into chaos by the unscheduled appearance of her older brother’s band of friends, including the one person she'd hoped to never face again. Abram still makes her feel entirely too much, which is one of the reasons she disappeared after their one week together. But now, trapped on a mountain of snow and things unspoken, Mona will have to find a way to coexist with Abram, chaos and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laws of Physics parts 1 (MOTION) &amp;amp; 2 (SPACE) end with a cliffhanger.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Forced to lie to protect her sister . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times Bestselling Author, Penny Reid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week.&lt;br /&gt;Home alone.&lt;br /&gt;Girl genius.&lt;br /&gt;Unrepentant slacker.&lt;br /&gt;Big lie.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona is a smart girl and figured everything out a long time ago. She had to. She didn’t have a choice. When your parents are uber-celebrities and you graduate from high school at fifteen, finish college at eighteen, and start your PhD program at nineteen, you don’t have time for distractions outside of your foci. Even fun is scheduled. Which is why Abram, her brother’s best friend, is such an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abram is a talented guy, a supremely gifted musician, and has absolutely nothing figured out, nor does he seem to care. He does what he feels, when he feels, and—in Mona’s opinion—he makes her feel entirely too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laws of Physics is the second trilogy in the Hypothesis series; Laws of Physics parts 1 (MOTION) &amp;amp; 2 (SPACE) end with a cliffhanger.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My brother's best friend has a proposition for me. Have I mentioned he's a sexy single dad? Tell me more...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are a million reasons why Miles Hart isn't the man I should date but allow me to enumerate the top three. He's friends with my brother, he's a single dad, and he's a sexy, in-demand rock star. He might as well wear an off-limits, totally unavailable, and don't-even-attempt-to-ride-this-ride sign. &lt;br /&gt;Then he asks me to be his plus-one when his band plays at his high school reunion, and the night unfolds in ways I never expect. &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;I have three good reasons to keep my hands off Roxy Sterling--her brother's my business manager and good buddy, my kid is the center of my world, and the last time I fell hard for a woman I was burned so badly that my interest in relationships has gone up in flames. But once I bring Roxy's body next to mine on the dance floor, I want all the not-safe-for-work things I can't have with her. So I make a proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then I learn exactly how risky we might be. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Pippa Wyndham is a top cellist―she’d never settle for anything less. Determined to get into the nation’s most prestigious music college, nothing’s going to stand in her way . . . Until her senior year of high school when a new guy from a fancy New York conservatory transfers to her school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan Brogan’s cocky, and he knows how amazing he is at the cello. He has every intention of knocking Pippa out of first chair and showing her who really belongs on top. Forced together when assigned a duet, their personal competition and mutual dislike transform into a teasing friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between her childhood crush and the boy who threatens her dreams, Pippa finds herself at risk of losing her best friend, her future, and the boy who makes her heart melt. Struggling to make things right, Pippa discovers that sometimes the thing you want the most doesn’t always end up being the thing you need.</description>

  <description>Enemies make the worst neighbors, but the best lovers &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After losing her job, her home, and her friends in her divorce, Nora Pitts is determined not to make the same mistakes when she starts over in the small town of Shadow Creek, Washington. No more slaving away in the lab at the expense of her social life, and definitely no more men. Ever. But making friends in her thirties is so much harder than she anticipated. And when it comes to her gorgeous yet obnoxious neighbor, it’s a whole lot easier to make enemies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eli Hardin doesn’t have a lot of sympathy for his uptight neighbor, until he overhears her so-called new friends making fun of her un-datable status. Suddenly he finds himself volunteering for a date with a woman who’s been leaving angry hate-notes in his mailbox, and in way over his head. Because all it takes is one disastrous date with Nora for Eli to fall hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But falling for Eli isn’t something Nora’s ready for—not when he’s her complete opposite, and especially not when he turns out to be the best friend she’s made in Shadow Creek. But as her attraction and her feelings for Eli grow hotter, resisting him might just lead to heartbreak anyway. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed this romance with its quirky female lead, and the annoying guy next door. There were a lot of things about Nora that I totally connected with. Not feeling comfortable going to a book group with people she didn't already know. Now, I'm not quite the neat freak she is, but I do have thing...]]>

  <description>In this sequel to the instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, Camille, her sister Edel, and her guard and new love Remy must race against time to find Princess Charlotte. Sophia's Imperial forces will stop at nothing to keep the rebels from returning Charlotte to the castle and her rightful place as queen. With the help of an underground resistance movement called The Iron Ladies-a society that rejects beauty treatments entirely-and the backing of alternative newspaper The Spider's Web, Camille uses her powers, her connections and her cunning to outwit her greatest nemesis, Sophia, and restore peace to Orleans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Only when she’s locked away does the truth begin to escape… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four walls. One window. No way to escape. Hannah knows there's been a mistake. She didn't need to be institutionalized. What happened to her roommate at her summer program was an accident. As soon as the doctors and judge figure out that she isn't a danger to herself or others, she can go home to start her senior year. In the meantime, she is going to use her persuasive skills to get the staff on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Lucy arrives. Lucy has her own baggage. And she may be the only person who can get Hannah to confront the dangerous games and secrets that landed her in confinement in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A high-stakes survival story about eight teenagers who outlive an alien attack—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The 5th Wave&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clover Martinez has always been a survivor, which is the only reason she isn't among the dead when aliens invade and destroy Earth as she knows it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clover hears an inexplicable radio message, she's shocked to learn there are other survivors—and that they're all at the former Area 51. When she arrives, she's greeted by a band of misfits who call themselves The Last Teenagers on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only they aren't the ragtag group of heroes Clover was expecting. The group seems more interested in hiding than fighting back, and Clover starts to wonder if she was better off alone. But then she finds a hidden spaceship, and she doesn't know what to believe…or who to trust.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Into every generation a Slayer is born…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina and her twin sister, Artemis, are far from normal. It’s hard to be when you grow up at the Watcher’s Academy, which is a bit different from your average boarding school. Here teens are trained as guides for Slayers—girls gifted with supernatural strength to fight the forces of darkness. But while Nina’s mother is a prominent member of the Watcher’s Council, Nina has never embraced the violent Watcher lifestyle. Instead she follows her instincts to heal, carving out a place for herself as the school medic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day Nina’s life changes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Buffy, the famous (and infamous) Slayer that Nina’s father died protecting, Nina is not only the newest Chosen One—she’s the last Slayer, ever. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nina hones her skills with her Watcher-in-training, Leo, there’s plenty to keep her occupied: a monster fighting ring, a demon who eats happiness, a shadowy figure that keeps popping up in Nina’s dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not until bodies start turning up that Nina’s new powers will truly be tested—because someone she loves might be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is clear: Being Chosen is easy. Making choices is hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When six clones join Emmaline’s prestigious boarding school, she must confront the heartbreak of seeing her dead best friend’s face each day in class.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Similars are all anyone can talk about at the elite Darkwood Academy. Who are these six clones? What are the odds that all of them would be Darkwood students? Who is the madman who broke the law to create them? Emma couldn't care less. Her best friend, Oliver, died over the summer and all she can think about is how to get through her junior year without him. Then she comes face-to-heartbreaking-face with Levi—Oliver's exact DNA replica and one of the Similars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma wants nothing to do with the Similars, but she keeps getting pulled deeper and deeper into their clique, uncovering dark truths about the clones and her prestigious school along the way. But no one can be trusted…not even the boy she is falling for who has Oliver's face.</description>

      <![CDATA[This one grabbed me from the start, and I couldn't put it down. I loved the idea behind these clones, and so much about them fit in with how the world is today with other types of discrimination. But when I would think one thing, something happened and it went another way, and I loved all the twi...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/em&gt; mashup that tells the tale of a shy, introverted high school girl who must relive the first day of school over and over again until her first kiss can break the curse … she hopes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andie is the type of girl who always comes up with the perfect thing to say … after it’s too late to say it. She’s addicted to romance movies—okay, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; movies—but has yet to experience her first kiss. After a move to Punxsutawney, PA, for her senior year, she gets caught in an endless loop of her first day at her new school, reliving those 24 hours again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced the curse will be broken when she meets her true love, Andie embarks on a mission: infiltrating the various cliques—from the jocks to the nerds to the misfits—to find the one boy who can break the spell. What she discovers along the way is that people who seem completely different can often share the very same hopes, dreams, and hang-ups. And that even a day that has been lived over and over can be filled with unexpected connections and plenty of happy endings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty in Punxsutawney&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addresses topical issues of self-discovery, navigating cliques, and ignoring stereotypes&lt;br /&gt;Is an homage to beloved 80s movies, such as John Hughes’ &lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is the perfect gift for birthdays and high school or college graduation&lt;br /&gt;Will captivate young adult readers of all ages with its universal coming-of-age themes about struggling to fit in, navigating the tough high school years, first kisses, and first crushes</description>

As someone who was a teenager in the 80s and still loves all things 80s, especially the movies from that time period.

  <description>A Harris Brother Scottish Wedding! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short story was first published in the Cocktales Anthology. It reads well as a standalone but will be enjoyed better if you read Challenge first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only professional footballer, Camden Harris, is cocky enough to elope to Scotland with his fiancé and leave the Harris Family behind.</description>

  <description>Millie Morris has always been one of the guys. A UC Santa Barbara professor, she’s a female-serial-killer expert who’s quick with a deflection joke and terrible at getting personal. And she, just like her four best guy friends and fellow professors, is perma-single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a routine university function turns into a black tie gala, Mille and her circle make a pact that they’ll join an online dating service to find plus-ones for the event. There’s only one hitch: after making the pact, Millie and one of the guys, Reid Campbell, secretly spend the sexiest half-night of their lives together, but mutually decide the friendship would be better off strictly platonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But online dating isn’t for the faint of heart. While the guys are inundated with quality matches and potential dates, Millie’s first profile attempt garners nothing but dick pics and creepers. Enter “Catherine”—Millie’s fictional profile persona, in whose make-believe shoes she can be more vulnerable than she’s ever been in person. Soon “Catherine” and Reid strike up a digital pen-pal-ship...but Millie can’t resist temptation in real life, either. Soon, Millie will have to face her worst fear—intimacy—or risk losing her best friend, forever.</description>

  <description>In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It sounds so simple, to love someone unconditionally. &lt;br /&gt;To give them your heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why is she slowly eating away at my soul with every unanswered phone call, every unread text, and every door left unopened? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She said yes, and yet, in order for her to be with me . . . I need to let her go. &lt;br /&gt;</description>
