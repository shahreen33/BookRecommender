  <description>Rhys Rivera is the star short-stop for the Longview Lumberjacks. Many know him, even more love him. He has a pretty face, a quick smile, and an air of danger about him that everyone seems to adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s not known as the bad boy of baseball for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with his father, who decided to be a criminal mob boss, then die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for his uncle, Rhys wants absolutely nothing to do with the family business and runs before anyone can figure out which way is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time his uncle, the successor to his father’s criminal empire, thinks to look for him, Rhys has made too big of a name for himself to be taken out quietly, and he wants to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward eight years, and Rhys is living life one breath at a time, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. That shoe coming in the form of a nosy neighbor who has no idea just how hot she is in her mail carrier uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her sweet little body and positive outlook on life make him want to laugh at how naïve she is when it comes to the way of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The harder he tries to stay away, the weaker he seems to get, until one day he decides to put his morals on hold long enough to satisfy his cravings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time is all he needs—or so he tells himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then two pink lines change everything, and suddenly, he doesn’t have just himself to worry about anymore.</description>

  <description>What’s wrong with my butt? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She means those words to be directed toward the woman beside her, not him. But he can’t stop himself from answering. Not when her ass is the most magnificent thing he’s seen in his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently, answering her with ‘not a damn thing’ wasn’t what she was expecting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She likely wasn’t expecting the baseball she took to the face at his next at bat, either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one ill-fated foul ball, and George Hoffman, Lumberjacks center fielder, falls head over heels in love with Wrigley Field—and yes, that is her real name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that point forward, George and Wrigley fall into a fast whirlwind love that ends with them eloping to Vegas. And he has his potty mouth, titty bar owning, pain in the ass grandmother to thank for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not that he’s complaining or anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who wouldn’t want to be married to a woman that made his heart race like he was in the final game of the World Series? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is trying to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>Baseball is life, the rest is just details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who’s played the game has heard those words a time or two. But Hancock has heard them his entire life from his parents. His family has lived and breathed baseball even before he started little league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hancock “Parts” Peters has a name that inspires grins across many faces, but the moment those faces get their first look at him, those grins slide away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hancock is gruff, filterless, and doesn’t give a crap who he offends. He is the only man in baseball who doesn’t care if he gets an endorsement or not. He’s there to play the game. He’s there to win. He’s there because baseball is his life.&lt;br /&gt;People think he’s a jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe he is. But if that’s how he has to come off to get people to leave him the hell alone so he can play in peace, so be it. The less people he has to worry about offending, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t let the fear of striking out hold you back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sway Coffman didn’t mean to rock the boat. She was just there to do her job.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, she was a woman in a man’s world. Yes, she beat out several of those men to get the job as head athletic trainer for the professional baseball team, The Texas Lumberjacks. And yeah, she now got hate mail from those men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she’s good at her job, and she earned the position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she is not good at, however, is talking to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men seem to see her curvy hips, large breasts and thick thighs and automatically think she is incompetent. Because surely a fat girl couldn’t get the job treating some of the most fit and athletic men in the world, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fat girl got the job, and she is proud of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else did she get?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attention of the sexiest bearded man she’d ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on.&lt;br /&gt;It was enough to bring to her down to her knees…in front of that man, the hot and grumpy baseball player, Hancock Peters.</description>

We've all had the bad boys, now it's time for a &lt;i&gt;Real Good Man&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fall for a woman over text messages? No way in hell.&lt;br /&gt;Reality can never be as good as the fantasy, right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. It’s better.&lt;br /&gt;Banner Regent is smart, funny, and she’s so far out of my league, she might as well be royalty.&lt;br /&gt;I’m a mechanic from Kentucky. She’s a New York City party girl.&lt;br /&gt;We were never supposed to meet, but one text started something neither of us saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;How do you seduce the woman who already has everything?&lt;br /&gt;Show her what it’s like to be with a real good man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Real Good Man&lt;/i&gt; is book one of the Real Duet. Logan and Banner's story will conclude in &lt;i&gt;Real Good Love&lt;/i&gt;, releasing January 17, 2017.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt; USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a sexy new spin-off duet from The Dirty Billionaire Trilogy. Are you ready to get dirty again? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Dirty Love &lt;/i&gt; is the conclusion of the Dirty Girl Duet, and should be read following &lt;i&gt; Dirty Girl&lt;/i&gt; . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greer Karas has been mine since the first day I saw her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked away because she deserved better than I could offer, but I always planned to come back and stake my claim when the time was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But true to form, Greer wasn't willing to wait. She threw down a challenge, and I’m meeting her head-on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not walking away this time because sometimes you have to fight dirty for love.</description>

  <description>From USA Today bestselling author Meghan March comes a sexy new spin-off duet from The Dirty Billionaire Trilogy. Are you ready to get dirty again? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Desperately seeking rich, famous, single guy with a giant cock to make my lying, cheating, should’ve-been-born-dickless ex-boyfriend realize what he’s just lost.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I give great head. Just sayin’. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No man in his right mind would answer that ad.&lt;br /&gt;Except thousands did.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Greer Karas, and I should never be allowed near another bottle of booze again. Because when I drink, my friend and I do stupid things. Like take a page out of my older brother Creighton’s playbook and post something completely asinine on the Internet. Waking up with a giant hangover to find my humiliating personal ad has gone viral is not my finest moment.&lt;br /&gt;Cue my look of shock when one of Hollywood’s hottest new bad boys, Cavanaugh Westman, comes knocking at my door and drops his pants to prove that he does indeed have a giant cock.&lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t have is an explanation for why he disappeared from my life without a word three years ago, only to show up on the big screen two years later, killing bad guys in action flicks.&lt;br /&gt;And now he wants me again.&lt;br /&gt;What the hell do I do now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greer and Cav's story will conclude in Dirty Love, releasing 5/31/16. </description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a story of untold truths and one man’s redemption in the Dirty Mafia Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every family has a black sheep. &lt;br /&gt;In the infamous Casso crime family, that black sheep is me—Cannon Freeman. &lt;br /&gt;Except I’m not a free man. I’ve never been free. Not since the day I was born. &lt;br /&gt;I owe my loyalty to my father, Dominic Casso, even if he won’t publicly acknowledge me as his blood. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve never had a reason to go against his wishes… until I met her. &lt;br /&gt;Drew Carson turned my world upside when she walked into my club looking for a job. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my honor and my life are on the line. &lt;br /&gt;Going against my father’s wishes might buy me a bullet straight from his gun, but black sheep or not, it’s time to make my stand. &lt;br /&gt;She's worth the fallout. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He knows that pain makes you stronger… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf isn’t always a good person, and he doesn’t hesitate to say what’s on his mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is who he is, and he doesn’t offer apologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He isn’t out to impress anyone, and he doesn’t make excuses for his actions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows that fear makes you braver… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven has made some bad decisions, and she’d give anything to go back in time and choose a different path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that she can’t go back, and the day Wolf walks into her life, she finally realizes that maybe she doesn’t want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf is everything she’s ever wanted, and the exact opposite of what she needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both know heartbreak makes you wiser… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf knows that this is not a good idea. There are a million reasons—all of them bad—telling him exactly why he should stay away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Raven’s nightmares burst out of her dreams and into her reality, he doesn’t have a choice anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has to protect her, while somehow protecting his battered heart.</description>

  <description>July Dupree and Dean ‘PD’ Hargrove fell head over heels in love. When PD comes home to tell July the good news about joining the SWAT team as a tactical medic, everything changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July can’t fathom why PD would want to be a cop in this day and age. Wasn’t it enough that he already had a dangerous job with the fire department? Now he has to add another, even more dangerous, job to the equation? With so many cruel people in the world who make a sport out of hurting cops just because of the badge they wear, she has to make him understand. But when he refuses to listen to her reasoning, she feels she has no other choice but to issue an ultimatum: her or the SWAT team. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean doesn’t like ultimatums. He’s furious with July for putting him in the awful position of having to choose between a dream and her. &lt;br /&gt;July never believes for a second that he’d choose the SWAT team over her, but she is wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both still in love with each other, but neither one is willing to budge regardless of their feelings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July’s feelings for Dean haven’t changed, in fact her love for him has only grown. But seeing him living his life seemingly unaffected by the loss of what they had breaks her heart over and over each time she sees him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean has a good poker face, though. He’s just going through the motions of his life until finally, the smoldering embers of his feelings erupt into a full-on blaze of emotion, burning through everything but his love for July. When the smoke clears, Dean wants to know if they can reignite the fire of their love or is he destined to live his life in a constant state of controlled burn?</description>

  <description>The road to hell is paved with good intentions… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apple “Core” Drew needs The Uncertain Saints MC like he needs air. He is barely making it through the day, and each one that goes by takes him closer and closer to hell. Literally, not figuratively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a half breath away from killing himself—maybe not by taking his own life, but he’s not against making someone else do it for him. &lt;br /&gt;Then he meets her. One of his club member’s sister, and his whole outlook on life changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And not for the better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as surely as he ruined his life, he ruins her life, too. One lapse in judgement on his part, and his one night of happiness turns into the worst nine months of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which he would’ve thought was damn near impossible with the things he’s done and seen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She never saw it coming… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was the beard. The beard made her do it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is a good excuse for having sex with a man she barely knows, isn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, who was she kidding? It wasn’t the beard. It was the way he looked so dejected and solemn. The sad look in his eyes pulls her in, and the way his rough hands touch her makes her stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All she wants to do is take that look out of his eyes, but the consequences to her actions only make things worse, not better. &lt;br /&gt;One day is all she gets, and he’s not willing to give her more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until she dies, that is. Then it’s too late.</description>

  <description>There are rules to life that one just obeys in order in her attempt to stay on the right path. For example: &lt;br /&gt;1. You don’t wear dirty panties out of the house. You just never know who’s going to see them. &lt;br /&gt;2. A lady must always have chocolate at the ready—just in case the world as she knows it comes to an end. &lt;br /&gt;3. You don’t egg on a drunk woman who’s pissed off at life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why, you ask? Because they start bar fights, that’s why. &lt;br /&gt;Casten Red, the unofficial enforcer of The Uncertain Saints MC, wasn’t necessarily trying to urge her into doing anything illegal, and he definitely wasn’t trying to get her into a fight with a group of men who were all twice her size. &lt;br /&gt;No, he only intended to give her the confidence to stand up for herself, just a little nudge in the right direction. How the hell was he supposed to know she’d go all Chuck Norris on them and put three of them in the hospital with concussions? &lt;br /&gt;He should’ve followed his gut instinct and turned around that first moment he saw her in the bar, but Casten has never liked following the rules. Why the hell would he start now? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>No take-backs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was the motto that Drew lived by in all things, including his love life. &lt;br /&gt;He’s a player, pure and simple. &lt;br /&gt;He’s learned the hard way that women aren’t all hearts and flowers. Sometimes their sexy bodies and beautiful faces are just a pretty shield to hide the crazy, and he’s so freakin’ over crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Been there, done that. He has the divorce papers to prove it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karma hits like a bitch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aspen needs a break. A long one that doesn’t include anything with a Y chromosome. Not even one as tempting as her new neighbor who just moved in across the street. Men are trouble with a capital freakin’ T, and she has the ankle monitor to prove it. &lt;br /&gt;The last man she gave her heart to was a police officer. A man whose life was dedicated to protection; he was supposed to protect her heart—not break it. &lt;br /&gt;She decides right then and there that she’s done with being the better person. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything happens for a reason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rash decision—undoubtedly regrettable, undeniably unforgettable. In the heat of the moment, Aspen’s actions with a tire iron and her ex-boyfriend’s brand new SUV land him in the ER getting stitches and have her seeing the inside of a jail cell for the first time. &lt;br /&gt;It’s just her luck that the whole town is there to witness the result of her poor decision, including her police officer brother and the neighbor that already made it more than clear she was more trouble than she was worth. &lt;br /&gt;House arrest never looked so good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hide your crazy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew enjoyed the show, though. For the first time in a year, he’s thinking about his life, and how it would be a lot more enjoyable with a woman like Aspen at his side. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe crazy isn’t so bad after all.</description>

  <description>Masen Crisfield fell in love with Booth Jones when she was sixteen years old. Booth was the love of her life. The rock she needed to get her through the day. Then she rips his heart out while he’s deployed, leaving him wondering just what he’d done to warrant something so severe as a breakup that neither of them wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stubbornness is their middle name, and ten long years pass before either one of them try to breach the gap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Circumstances force Booth to come home, and within an hour of him being back in his home town, there she is. Right back in the forefront of his mind where he knows she shouldn’t be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The day he starts his first civilian job at Kilgore Fire Department, his worst fear of seeing Masen is realized. And not only does he see her, but he sees her with another man. A fellow firefighter that he has to trust with his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It soon becomes apparent that they are both still just as much in love with each other now as they were the moment they met. But there’s a problem. Booth’s married, and Masen’s in a committed relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They fight the pull with everything they have, but they’re both about to learn the true meaning of flash point as their lives crash together. Their love consuming everything in it’s path.</description>

  <description>Lies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mig’s wife is a bitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How else do you describe a woman that lies, cheats and steals to get what she wants? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s exactly what happens when she traps him into a marriage he wants nothing to do with, saddling him with a kid that he knows doesn’t deserve to be in a world like his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s doing a pretty bang-up job at ignoring everything but his responsibilities as a DEA officer and a member of The Uncertain Saints MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then his neighbor knocks on his door, and everything he thought he knew is blown out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deceit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie teaches Mig that not every woman is out to get him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her love for Mig stretches past what’s appropriate for two friends, and Annie soon straddles that invisible boundary between appropriate and inappropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie’s not a cheater, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she tries to say goodbye, Mig won’t let her leave, and soon the tiny town of Uncertain blows up with the news of Annie and Mig’s innocent friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matters of the heart are foreign to Mig, and it takes Annie being gutted for him to see the wrong he’s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He waits too long, though, and Annie’s heart is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wants it all, or she wants nothing. She can’t take anymore half-hearted attempts at being just friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart wants what it wants, and it doesn’t take long for Mig to realize that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when Mig finally has it all in the palm of his hand, his life is ripped to shreds by a new player in the game, and it takes all of Annie’s love and devotion, as well as help from the men of The Uncertain Saint’s MC, to put Mig back together again.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Ashley comes a new story in her Dream Man series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte “Lottie” McAlister is in the zone. She’s ready to take on the next chapter of her life, and since she doesn’t have a man, she’ll do what she’s done all along. She’ll take care of business on her own. Even if that business means starting a family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Lottie has a stalker. The really bad kind. The kind that means she needs a bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Mo Morrison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enormous. Scary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mo doesn’t say much, and Lottie’s used to getting attention. And she wants Mo’s attention. Badly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Mo has a strict rule. If he’s guarding your body, that’s all he’s doing with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the longer Mo has to keep Lottie safe, the faster he falls for the beautiful blonde who has it so together, she might even be able to tackle the demons he’s got in his head that just won’t die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the end, Lottie and Mo don’t only have to find some way to keep hands off until the threat is over, they have to negotiate the overprotective Hot Bunch, Lottie’s crazy stepdad, Tex, Mo’s crew of frat-boy commandos, not to mention his nutty sisters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All before Lottie finally gets her Dream Man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Mo can lay claim to his Dream Girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

  <description>Gareth Black is drawn to December Mayson the moment he spots her across the room at her cousin’s wedding. When he approaches the beautiful woman, she captivates him with her shyness and wit, making him crave her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a pull so strong it’s impossible to ignore, December knows there’s something between her and Gareth. She just hopes they’re capable of jumping the hurdles ahead of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two boys, an ex, a surprise that will change everything, and a disgruntled co-worker, guarantee these two will have their work cut out for them if they are going to find their happily ever after.</description>

  <description>I shouldn't want him, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got one week to get through until my mother’s estate clears, and then I'll be free to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I've got to do is keep my hands off my new step-dad, Bruce. But that's easier said than done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn't want her, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember the last time I touched a woman. Hell, I can't remember the last time I touched myself. But ever since little Sophie showed up, I can't think of anything but claiming her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forbidden love and secret obsessions will have you begging for the climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: You can beg all you want...Bruce won't be forced.</description>

  <description>Ghosts are real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, technically speaking, maybe not. But the ones that haunt a man’s soul? Those are very real. So real, in fact, that there are times when Castiel would rather silence them forever in the worst way possible than to go on living with them haunting his every step. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it took was one single second in time for his attention to drift, and everything changed. &lt;br /&gt;Life as he once knew it, is over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s struggling to make sense of the pieces that are left, and he’s fairly sure at least half of them are missing. &lt;br /&gt;He’s living for three things now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His club—the Bear Bottom Guardians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His work as a police officer for Bear Bottom Police Department. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the occasional glimpse of a girl that makes his spirit feel free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the ghosts that haunt him, he’s not willing to present them with another target. Which is why he has to stay away from her. He can’t touch her. He can’t talk to her. He can’t get anywhere near her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not and live with himself afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, Turner doesn’t care what Castiel wants. She also has a solution for his ghosts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may call her Ms. Ghostbuster.</description>

  <description>Zee + Annmarie and Tan + Jubilee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever. No exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They were to have the picture-perfect life together. Everything was all planned out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jubilee was to marry Eitan and Ezekiel was to marry Annmarie. That’s how it was always supposed to be from the moment that they met. Textbook, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eitan and Annmarie die in a freak accident that never should have happened, leaving the two survivors reeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Jubilee and Zee can’t even be in the same room with each other before things begin to deteriorate. Too many memories. Too much pain. Not enough forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re like hellfire and holy water, and neither one of them is willing to admit that they’re wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one day things change, and all of a sudden, they’re looking at each other like maybe they aren’t each other’s enemies after all. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Benson Bayou Beauregard is the president of the Bear Bottom Guardians MC, and the grandson of the Sergeant at Arms for the Dixie Wardens MC. He’s a mountain of a man and the warden of a prison, and there’s only one thing that can scare him—being told that he’s the father of a three-year-old little girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A three-year-old little girl that has no clue who he is. Hell, he only finds out about the little cherub when a woman from child protective services comes by and rocks his world before leaving the girl in his shocked arms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every single thing he thinks he knows goes up in a cloud of smoke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the woman that he’s been trying to convince to give him a chance takes one look at the little girl and tells him that he’s just not in the right place to handle both of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Bayou was never one to back down from a challenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can handle a three-year-old girl that acts exactly like him, and he can more than take on the fiery red-head that sets flame to his blood while he’s at it.</description>

  <description>Hoax knows two things very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One, he’s not relationship material. Two, the nurse that treats him for erectile dysfunction is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and practically has ‘the marrying type’ stamped on her forehead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does that stop him from wanting her? No. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, he learned a long time ago that Army Delta Force and long-lasting relationships don’t go hand in hand. &lt;br /&gt;But beautiful hazel eyes, curly blonde hair, and the prettiest lips he’s ever seen play havoc with his resolve, making him forget his earlier convictions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one teeny, tiny kiss for every shred of control he has to disappear, along with the problem in his pants. &lt;br /&gt;Soon he finds himself doing things that he knows that he shouldn’t. He doesn’t know that he’s found the woman that’s meant to be his. Nor does he realize that her father is the man he’s idolized from the moment he joined the army at the age of eighteen. Because, maybe if he had, he would’ve tried a little harder to ignore the pull he felt between them instead of making her his the night before he deployed for six months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He also might’ve tried a little harder not to knock her up. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Wade had everything he could ever want in life…then he lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, his life—his forever girl—is living in a house he built for her while he’s struggling to move on and find meaning where there isn’t any to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Landry Hill was his girl. His everything. His first kiss. His first and only love. His old lady and wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day he does something monumentally stupid, and she walks away knowing she’ll never come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and he’s still just as in love with her now as he was when she left. The only problem is that she’s moved on with her life, found a new man, and has seemingly forgotten him. Then there’s Wade—stuck in the same awful place where she abandoned him. The only thing he has left is his job as a police officer and the Bear Bottom MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when they both think things can’t get any worse, life kicks them both in the teeth, and Landry finds out really quick that the only person she can depend on is the one that let her walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that understanding comes a deal. One that Landry has no hope of ever breaking free from, and one Wade will do everything in his power to make a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing is still certain. The force that split them apart is still out there, and there’s no hope of escaping fate.</description>

  <description>Linc has two very important things on his mind—professional football and his motorcycle club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he does not have on his mind is the woman that drives him crazy and makes him want to do stupid things, like throw caution to the wind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope, not Linc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s the lie he tells everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In reality, every time Conleigh’s name is mentioned, he squirms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s everything that he wants, wrapped up in a cute little package that is stamped ‘hands freakin’ off.’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s four years younger than him, in school to be a doctor, and thinks football is stupid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even more, Linc and Conleigh get along like oil and water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s not a single second that they’re in each other’s presence that they’re not at each other’s throats. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But all it takes is hearing that she’s in trouble for Linc to drop every single thing—football and MC duties alike—and head to her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A side that he’ll remain at until they either kill each other, or finally give into the heat between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either way you look at it, he’s well and truly screwed. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When Rome Pierce moved to Bear Bottom, Texas, it was his intention to lay low. To not be seen. To find a way to heal his body and soul—as well as his son’s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody would know by looking at him that he used to play professional football. Not with the Bear Bottom MC cut covering his back, and definitely not with his friendly smile completely obliterated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No longer is there charm in each smooth word that comes out of his mouth. What’s left is an angry, bitter, scared man that’s terrified one day he’s going to wake up and his entire world is going to be gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows what drove him to leave the game he loved—nobody but her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the one person that has helped him make it through the dark days and even darker nights. She’s the bright and shining star in his pitch-black sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And he doesn’t even know her name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He should be afraid that she knows things that not anyone—not even his best friend—knows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, with each encounter, he gives what little bit of his soul remains, and before he knows it only two people on this earth—one dying, and one too afraid to live—make his life worth living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until one day he has to choose—the love of his life, or the life he brought into this world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two impossible situations. One decision that would change him forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Librarian Note - Reader Caution - This book contains triggers for the following:&lt;br /&gt;*Anyone who has recently experienced the death of their child or a child close to them.&lt;br /&gt;*Anyone whose child or other family member has recently had cancer or some other extreme illness. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Ever since Melanie's mom married Kurt's dad she's had the hots for her gorgeous, off-limits stepbrother. Knowing that Kurt feels the same way doesn't help her lust but through an unspoken agreement they ignore their forbidden feelings. Then Kurt drives her to a modeling shoot for an exercise book and winds up volunteering to model as her partner. What neither of them know is that the exercises in the book are all sexual--a modern Kama Sutra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie tries to ignore the sparks flying between her and Kurt, even when they have to get naked and pose for pictures that are both explicit and erotic. But how can she resist her sexy stepbrother? Will she and Kurt be able to keep from breaking the most forbidden taboo of all or will they give in to temptation in order to get every shot Picture Perfect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publisher's Note: While Kurt and Melanie have no blood ties and their relationship is fully consensual, some readers, particularly those with a history of sexual abuse or incest, may find this story disturbing. This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Exhibitionism, sex between stepsiblings, voyeurism.</description>

  <description>I'm the hopeless romantic in the family and I don't care who knows. My brothers make fun of me for it, calling me "Princess" and "Cinderella" every chance they get, but I couldn't care less. I'm done with one night stands and women who mean nothing to me. My dating for the sake of dating days are over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what I want and I refuse to settle for less. I'm ready to find "the one." You know exactly what I'm talking about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mom Sofia can't stand me. I want to get to know her better, but she keeps pushing me away. I just need one chance to show her that I'm not the guy she thinks I am, but she won't let me get anywhere near her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a single mom has made her heart guarded. Being a single guy has made my heart determined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder who's heart is going to give in first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fisher Brothers is a series of standalone novels that can be sipped one at a time, or binged in order. Each book is aptly named after one of the popular drinks at their bar. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;No Bad Days- Nick's story&lt;br /&gt;Guy Hater- Frank's story&lt;br /&gt;Adios Pantalones- Ryan's story</description>

  <description>I might be the quiet one, but I hear everything. The women who come into my bar aren't at all silent about their wants or desires. And I'm one of them. They call me "sexy, alluring and mysterious." They want to be "spanked by Frank." Hell, there's even a hashtag. But none of that matters until she walks through my doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body reacts.&lt;br /&gt;My whole world shifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want her, but I can't have her. And if she finds out the truth about me, I'll lose my shot forever. That's not a chance I'm willing to take. I just hope I'm strong enough to do what needs to be done before it's too late.</description>

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling Author, J. Sterling comes another smash hit in the college romance department! If you loved The Perfect Game, you're going to love No Bad Days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm the hottest guy at State. It's not cocky when it's the truth. Girls want to date me. Guys want to be me. Cliche, I know, but welcome to my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's more to me than what they all see though. Isn't that usually the case? No one knows the reality of my life. They think they do, but they have no idea. I hide it well. I have to or it will break me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess Michaelson is gorgeous, ambitious and totally wants me. She doesn't hide it well. Honestly, I'm not sure she even tries. Jess thinks I'll give up pursuing her... but I won't. She thinks this is just some game I'm playing at... but it's not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess belongs with me and I'm going to make sure she knows it.</description>

  <description>She’s a romantic at heart, living in the most unromantic of worlds . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nicknamed Sweet Abelli for her docile nature, Elena smiles on cue and has a charming response for everything. She’s the favored daughter, the perfect mafia principessa . . . or was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all she can see in the mirror’s reflection is blood staining her hands like crimson paint.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say first impressions are everything . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the murky waters of New York’s underworld, Elena’s sister is arranged to marry Nicolas Russo. A Made Man, a boss, a cheat—even measured against mafia standards. His reputation stretches far and wide and is darker than his black suits and ties. After his and Elena’s first encounter ends with an accidental glare on her part, she realizes he’s just as rude as he is handsome.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t like the man or anything he stands for, though that doesn’t stop her heart from pattering like rain against glass when he’s near, nor the shiver that ghosts down her spine at the sound of his voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s always near. Telling her what to do. Making her feel hotter than any future brother-in-law should. Elena may be the Sweet Abelli on the outside, but she’s beginning to learn she has a taste for the darkness, for rough hands, cigarettes, and whiskey-colored eyes. Having already escaped one scandal, however, she can hardly afford to be swept up in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, even if he were hers, everyone knows you don’t fall in love with a Made Man . . . right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; forbidden romance.</description>

  <description>Born into one of the leading Mob families in Chicago, Aria Scuderi struggles to find her own path in a world where no choices are given. Aria was only fifteen when her parents betrothed her to Luca – The Vice – Vitiello, the oldest son of the head of the New York Cosa Nostra to ensure peace between the two families. &lt;br /&gt;Now with eighteen, the day Aria has been dreading for years is looming dangerously: her wedding to Luca. &lt;br /&gt;Aria is terrified of marrying a man she hardly knows, especially someone like Luca who got his nickname ‘the Vice’ for crushing a man’s throat with his bare hands. Luca might be one of the most sought after men in New York thanks to his good looks, wealth and predator-like charisma that radiates power, but the society girls throwing themselves at him don’t know what Aria does: that the bad boy aura isn’t just a game; blood and death lurk beneath Luca’s striking gray eyes and arrogant smile.&lt;br /&gt;In her world a handsome exterior often hides the monster within; a monster who can just as easily kill as kiss you.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to escape the marriage to Luca would be to run away and leave everything she’s ever known behind but Aria can’t bear the thought of never seeing her family again. &lt;br /&gt;Despite her fear, she decides to go through with the marriage; Aria has grown up among predators like Luca and knows that even most cold-hearted bastards have a heart and she has every intention of working her way into Luca’s.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30991325-lucian" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucian Marcello is aware of the expectations following him as the oldest son of one of North America’s most infamous Cosa Nostra Dons. Family in his world is more than blood and sharing a last name. It’s the honor, respect, business, and the life. Being a Capo is just a stepping stone until it’s time for him to take on the role of underboss but a chance meeting with her could be the one thing he’d risk it all for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is exactly what he didn’t know he was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordyn Reese spends her time trying to stay under the radar of a man who wouldn’t think twice about killing her. Unwillingly affiliated with a dangerous MC gang, her life is dominated by the men surrounding her and her future rests solely in how useful she can be for them. The last thing she needs is some Mafioso gaining her more unwanted attention from the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is everything she should stay away from but can’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notoriously violent when it comes to getting what he wants, Lucian will stop at nothing to make the target on Jordyn’s back disappear. But sometimes the worst threats are the ones you can’t see until it’s too late. The truth behind Lucian’s history is about to take center stage in more ways than one, and it’ll either save him … or kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This world leaves everyone a little filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filthy Marcellos, Book One&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filthy Marcellos: La Cosa Nostra is not just a choice of regime and routine, it’s a culture. Born as mafia royalty, the Marcello brothers were raised ingrained with the beliefs and rules of what it meant to be a Mafioso prince. It is for life. Their status is considered a given right. They will always be these people. They will always be Marcellos.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ASIN: B00OVPD746&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please Note: The Score is not a standalone title. The first books in the Russian Guns series (The Arrangement, followed by The Life) should be read first*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mess of love and life, nothing and no one is left untouched. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After everything the Russian mob boss Anton Avdonin has done to keep his family safe from the dangers of the world surrounding them, he never thought it would come down to this. The officials are knocking, the charges are piling, his wife is hurting, and they’re facing a fate he never thought to consider. He didn’t just make one mistake … no, he made many. It’s time to answer for them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viviana “Vine” Avdonin is stuck watching the life she adores crumble around her. Bad decisions have led to terrible consequences in more ways than one. She doesn’t have time to recover from one devastating tragedy that leaves her shattered before the next one is crushing down, too. Saving her husband from a life sentence might be the easiest thing she has to do when her own misdeeds are staring her in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Anton and Viviana have survived more than once, but this path will be by far, the hardest they’ve ever walked. Sometimes they have to walk it alone … because forgiveness isn’t always black and white and love can be blurred by pain. With the blissful ignorance gone and the blinders removed, how much of themselves will they have to sacrifice to come out on top one last time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When everyone has a score to settle, it’s hard to notice the person causing the most heartache is the one staring back in the mirror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third installment to The Russian Guns&lt;br /&gt;Sequel to The Life&lt;br /&gt;Expected Publication: October 27th, 2014</description>

  <description>*Please Note, The Life is not a standalone title. The first book in The Russian Guns series (The Arrangement) should be read before the second book*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mafia life is a dangerous one revolving around honor, duty, and greed—a troublesome thing like love isn’t meant to play a part, but no one follows the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by men waiting for the Russian mob boss to show weakness, Anton Avdonin should have known showering affection so openly on his new bride wasn’t a good idea. Of course, that didn’t stop him. When Anton’s wife begins attracting unwanted attention from an unknown source, he’s determined to find out just who is playing the risky game and put a stop to it by whatever means necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a Cosa Nostra princess to a Bratva queen, Viviana “Vine” Avdonin was made for the life. Pregnant, safe, and loved, she’s more than happy to move on from the history that haunts her to start out fresh. Then again, someone else has other plans. Old rivals from the past and bad blood from the present have mixed in the worst way, threatening to take away the things Viviana loves the very most. No matter what, she can’t let that happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Viviana and Anton know there’s only one way this can all end and it’s up to them to do it. But, who is behind the veiled threats and personal attacks, and how far are they willing to go to get what they want? When the truth finally surfaces, the consequences will be devastating and no one could have seen it coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a life where everybody plays for keeps and no one fights fair, one mistake might cost them everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sequel to The Arrangement &lt;br /&gt;The Russian Guns, Book Two</description>

  <description>Nothing will stop the Bratva mob boss from taking back what’s his, and once he has her, he’ll do anything to keep her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viviana “Vine” Carducci’s and Anton Avdonin’s marriage was decided more than two decades ago. The deal between leading mafia families has more on the line than anyone knew, even if the Bratva and Cosa Nostra shouldn’t mix. When Vine’s family is murdered and she’s left with nothing more than her grief to survive the mob world alone, she believes the arrangement won’t see the light of day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anton can’t allow the one woman he was supposed to love get away. At the possibility of her death, he steps in to save her with guns blazing, knowing exactly what it might cost him: everything. But it’s been nearly a decade since their last meeting, and he can’t help but wonder if the woman he took back is the same girl he fell for all those years before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protected and loved, Vine is unable to forget their shared moments a lifetime ago, or the future she knows they’re owed. When an old flame of Anton’s shows up to rip the veil off the carefully constructed secrets he’d been hiding, she learns that nothing about her life is as it seems. But, that’s nothing compared to the bomb about to blow. Can Vine see beyond the pain and blood to take what she always wanted? And just how far will the mob prince go to keep her safe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where violence, deceit, and greed reign, your life is not your own, and sometimes, love has to be arranged.</description>

  <description>James Bryant is trying her best to quit her job as a thief, but she needs one more big job to get the money she needs. When she literally runs into a man on the street and takes his wallet, she never imagines that the muscled beast would come back to haunt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett Hughes lives a life of luxury and solitude. There’s nothing he can’t get if he wants it, but when a pickpocket catches his attention and gets away he finds it impossible to track her down. Luckily for him he knows people in all the wrong places, and as soon as he gets his hands on her, he’ll make sure she’s bound to him in every possible way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It’s the newest addition to our baby-making series and it’s filthier than ever before! If you loved Coach, Mechanic, Thief, Kingpin, and Judge, then this one is waiting for you to love it.</description>

  <description>Tobias Gamble knew from a young age precisely the kind of woman he was going to make his. She was not going to be like his mother. She was going to be like the mother he claimed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, she was going to be just right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when Toby returns to his hometown of Matlock, Kentucky and claps eyes on Adeline Forrester, he knows she’s the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, his brother Johnny has a new girlfriend. And Addie is her sister. Last, Toby would do nothing to hurt Johnny’s chance at happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby hangs around town to get to know the woman Johnny fell in love with. He also hangs around to get to know Addie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s fallen hard, and he knows the best thing for him—and Addie—is for him to leave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie Forrester is thrilled her sister Eliza found a good, solid man. Johnny Gamble is the salt of the earth. The best guy in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best except for his brother, Toby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby doesn’t know it, but Addie’s fallen hard too. He’s perfect, except for the fact that he’s hands off and it’s torture, being friends with Toby when she wants so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie also has a lot on her mind. She’s got bills to pay, her young son needs food, Christmas is coming and her job at the grocery store just isn’t cutting it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby is steering clear of Addie. Addie is steering clear of Toby. But everyone around them knows this is the slow burn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because just like Eliza and Johnny, Addie and Toby were made for each other. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Done with being the world's biggest pushover, Haley decides that things are going to change starting with the aggravating neighbor who has too much charm and not enough restraint. What she didn't expect was to be sucked into his world, but Haley has a game plan and she won't let herself forget just what the bad boy next door is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Jason expected was for his little shy neighbor to go Rambo on him over some ruined flowers. After he decides to take her under his wing he can't help but that notice that she fits very nicely in his life. Now the only thing left is to convince her that this is anything but a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2011 R.L. Mathewson</description>

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward, comes the first book in a new, sexy duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How to kick off a great summer in the Hamptons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snag a gorgeous rental on the beach. Check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Get a job at a trendy summer haunt. Check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How to screw up a great summer in the Hamptons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fall for the one guy with a dark leather jacket, scruff on his face, and intense eyes that doesn’t fit in with the rest of the tony looking crowd. A guy you can’t have when you’ll be leaving at the end of the season. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Check. Check. Check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should add—especially when the guy is your sexy, tattooed God of a boss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially when he not only owns your place of employment but inherited half of the town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially when he’s mean to you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until one night when he demanded I get in his car so he could drive me home because he didn’t want me walking in the dark. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was sort of how it all started with Rush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then little by little, some of the walls of this hardass man started to come down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never expected that the two of us, seemingly opposites from the outside, would grow so close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn't supposed to fall for the rebel heir, especially when he made it clear he didn’t want to cross the line with me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the temperature turned cooler, the nights became hotter. My summer became a lot more interesting—and complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except our ending was one I didn’t see coming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rebel Heir is the first book in the Rush Series Duet. Book Two, Rebel Heart, will release six weeks later on May, 22, 2018.</description>

  <description>Hail to the king, and watch him reign, this game was somewhat fun, until the finale came…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we’re here, with carnage and despair, and the only questions left to answer, are the ones that do not appear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A king loses a war, and a swan sheds her wings, chaos collides with peace, as the crows begin to sing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter if you dare, because I swear the end is near, but nothing is as it seems, and everything is so bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what the f*ck is going on at Riverside,&lt;br /&gt;I think, I think... everyone is about to die....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“I thought I knew who I was, but I was wrong.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;- 1. &lt;i&gt; A girl who is tarnished. Tainted. One who does not fit into the confinement of legend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;-2. &lt;b&gt;Madison Montgomery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lied to.&lt;br /&gt;I was cheated.&lt;br /&gt;Resigned to pick up the scraps of empty memories and disarrayed thoughts, I left. After finally cutting the strings of manipulation, I resorted to do what I’ve done since I was a child, something my father drilled into my brain since I could handle my first rifle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a mere shadow of the girl they all knew.&lt;br /&gt;Lies and deceit change you. They alter your entire outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;I’m Madison Montgomery, and I want to play a game.&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what happens when I &lt;i&gt;win&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riddle me this, Mads.&lt;br /&gt;What goes bump in the night,&lt;br /&gt;but is something you can’t see with sight?&lt;br /&gt;You may run, and you may hide.&lt;br /&gt;If by happily ever after, you mean Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Riddle me this...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I am neither dead, nor alive, and I’m not something little Madison can hide.&lt;br /&gt;But you will be dead, by the time this is done...&lt;br /&gt;the timer starts now, and the games have just begun…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison Montgomery comes from money and power, but when someone close to her commits the ultimate crime, Madison must live with her tainted name for the rest of her life. When she begins Riverside Preparatory Academy, the private school her father has swept her into in The Hamptons, she hopes for a fresh start. What she wasn't hoping for was the pack of bad boys who run the school; ten, to be exact. When Madison gains the attention of their leader, Bishop Vincent Hayes, a whole new world that she didn't think existed is exposed to her. A whole world that starts and ends with The Elite Kings Club and these boys, are about to flip her world upside down. Secrets are overflowing and family lies are about to be exposed. Is there more to Madison Montgomery than even she knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this book: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to admit something right now. The Silver Swan is &lt;i&gt;f*cked&lt;/i&gt;. It might be the most &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; story I've ever written with equally &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; characters. Who knew? You know, when I started this book, it was supposed to be YA. I wanted to write a book that my sisters could read. A book that won't have people look at my mum like &lt;i&gt;"damn... what sort of messed up shit happened to your kid?"&lt;/i&gt;. The angst, the assholeness, the games, the f**kery, the &lt;b&gt;WHAT THE F**KING F**K ARE YOU DOING???!!!...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot even.... anyway, this is a &lt;b&gt;warning&lt;/b&gt; (and the only one I'll give you). It's crazy. I don't compare my work to my others, but this book is f**ked. It will most likely stomp all the f**k over people's hard limits (and not give a sh*t while it's doing it) and will make you second guess all the morals you thought you had.&lt;br /&gt;This most definitely is not looking like a love story right now... more like a..... I don't even....*shakes head* anyway, I apologise now. You asked for it..........</description>

  <description>It starts with a single kiss… it’ll end with complete surrender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgeanne Hayes is his best friend’s little sister. Off limits. Too perfect for the likes of Black Ops soldier Sam McKnight—no matter how badly he wants to corrupt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgie has wanted Sam for as long as she can remember. But all he’s ever done is push her away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that someone wants her dead, he’ll fight to save her—and he won’t give in to the need that haunts his every waking moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His life far is too dangerous. Too unpredictable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She plans to convince him he’s wrong. That she’s strong enough. She’ll fight for him, and she’ll win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has to… because her very survival might depend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is an updated story! If you read and loved the old HOT MESS, you don't have to buy this one. If you were left wanting a little bit more -- more suspense, more action, more emotion -- then this one might be for you. This book is updated with over 10k words of new material! Because of that, it's being published as an expanded edition rather than the same book.**</description>

  <description>He took her innocence. He broke her heart. He's the only one who can save her life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie Baker hasn’t seen Matt Girard in ten years. Not since the night she gave him her virginity. Now the Black Ops soldier is back in town and looking to make things right. Too bad she doesn’t believe a word he says. But when her sister goes missing and Evie’s suddenly a suspect in a murder, Matt’s the only man she can trust to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt knew Evie wanted forever ten years ago, but all he wanted was escape. He’s older and wiser now, and he knows what matters. He’ll do whatever it takes—break any rules necessary—to protect Evie and find her sister. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he’ll do everything he can to win his best friend’s heart and prove he’s the man she needs him to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Forced to represent an outlaw biker, a married attorney must come to terms with her feelings for her client while avoiding the danger he brings into her sedate life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President of the Lost Kings MC, Rochlan "Rock" North, hasn't managed to find a woman capable of making him want to curb his wild ways—until he meets sweet, innocent, married lawyer Hope Kendall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to represent the outlaw biker, Hope is rattled by her immediate attraction to Rock. Hope is a good girl in a good marriage. Rock thrills her, but she's not going to throw away everything she's built on a fling with her criminal client. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock respects Hope enough to leave her alone, even as he realizes he's become a little obsessed with her. When their connection endangers her life, he'll have to destroy her in order to save her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tragedy strikes, Rock is determined to earn Hope's forgiveness and convince her that even with their staggering differences, they're meant to be together.</description>

  <description>Wanting the perfect man doesn’t make me crazy. I just know what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful billionaire in a suit wasn’t even my first choice. McAllister Stonewall was never on my radar, I didn’t even know he existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hands are all over me at work. The heat of his chest pressing against my bare back as he bends me over the desk is the only thing on my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is my most forbidden desires unleashed. He is my new secret obsession. He is my Mr. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the moment I realize… There’s no such thing as perfect.</description>

  <description>Nora Vaughn is living on the streets and trying to keep under the radar. Luck is on her side one day when the hot stranger she’s been watching drops his keycard and she’s able to get into a safe place. What she doesn’t expect is for him to find her naked in the shower and demanding she repay what she’s stolen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith Prescott is a well-known judge who has worked his entire life to build a reputation. But one look at the young woman in front of him and he’s willing to throw it all away to have her. She’s forcing his hand and his iron will to do the things he’s sworn against. But what’s the point of having all this power if he can’t use it to have her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is quick and dirty and dripping with filth. If you love our books Coach, Mechanic, Thief, and Kingpin, then this one will give you all the feels you’re after. Enjoy some quality time in the judge’s chambers.</description>

I married a billionaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reasons are my own, but the last thing I expected was to feel owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have taken vows, but I’m still determined to be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now his rules are taking over my world, but I’m not the kind of girl to just obey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one problem: I might actually be falling for him…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this marriage is going to go, but holding onto a piece of myself while succumbing to his dirty pleasures is shaping up to be the ride of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Pleasures &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in The Dirty Billionaire Trilogy. &lt;i&gt;Dirty Together&lt;/i&gt;, the conclusion of this filthy trilogy, will release on 1/12/2016.</description>

  <description>I've got a big dick and an even bigger bank account. That's pretty much where my bio ends. Honestly, I don't need to say anything else. I've just sold 99% of women on going home with me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do I sound like an asshole to you?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's because I am.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And guess what? It works for me just fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or at least it did.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until I met her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Books talk about sparks flying. Fuck that shit. With her, it was like emergency flares mixed with jet fuel. Or maybe just straight up napalm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She didn't leave her name or number when she disappeared from the hotel room after the hottest fucking night of my life. Now I've had a taste of unicorn pussy—the sweetest, rarest of all pussy—and I need it again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what's an asshole to do?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I took this problem to the street. A missed connection gone viral.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when I find her? I'm keeping her.</description>

  <description>Celia Lawrence can’t show her face in her conservative, small town. First, she discovered her husband in bed with another man’s wife, and then she witnessed both their murders. While she didn’t pull the trigger, small town gossip is not forgiving and everywhere she goes she is chastised for not being woman enough to keep her straying husband at home. Eager to flee her old life, Celia heads to Colorado as a mail-order bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mayor of Slate Springs, Colorado, Luke Benson is expected to set the example. Their small town is hidden away in a remote mountainous region where few women have the courage or desire to tread. As mayor, it falls to him to test out their newly passed law and share a wife with his brother. The truth is, Luke has no interest in a woman of his own, and agrees to a mail-order bride out of duty, not anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His brother, Walker, is jaded and hard after the death of his first wife and unborn child. For Walker, loving again is out of the question. But a man has needs, and he’ll eagerly take his pleasure from their new bride while expecting Luke to provide the tenderness and caring a woman expects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A marriage based on everything but love should be doomed. But Celia, Luke and Walker discover one thing they have in common: desire. Will that be strong enough to survive the danger that follows Celia from Texas? Will desire be strong enough to teach three broken that sometimes you have to risk everything for love?</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Meghan March comes the stunning conclusion to the Forge Trilogy. In this final volume, ruthless billionaire Jericho Forge faces his toughest challenge. To emerge victorious, he’ll have to give up the one thing he’s never offered a woman—his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started as a game. She was nothing but my pawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was quick to see the error in my ways, and now she is everything I never knew I needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of a woman like India Baptiste is beyond measure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the problem with being a man like me? I’ve already screwed this up, and there’s no guarantee India will take me on for one last bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll do whatever I have to do. Drop to my knees and offer her the only thing I have left. The one thing that’s only ever been hers—the heart of the devil.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Meghan March continues the story of ruthless, calculating billionaire Jericho Forge in Luck of the Devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My poker face has always been one of my greatest assets, along with my grit and determination. I was beholden to no one. Asked permission for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Then Jericho Forge took my life by storm.&lt;br /&gt;I traded my freedom for something infinitely more precious, but I didn’t realize he was holding an unbeatable hand.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all I have to do is survive the high-stakes game that is my life—with my heart intact.&lt;br /&gt;But not falling in love with Forge? That will take the luck of the devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luck of the Devil is the second book of the Forge Trilogy, and should be read following Deal with the Devil. The Forge Trilogy concludes in Heart of the Devil.</description>

  <description>"You can put that man in a suit, but he'll never be tame." &lt;br /&gt;One look at Jericho Forge and I knew the rumors were true. He was a predator, and he had set his sights on me.&lt;br /&gt;I knew better than to bet more than I could afford to lose that night. I knew better than to bet myself. But desperation leads to bad decisions, and I thought there was no way I could lose.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have no choice but to make a deal with the devil.</description>

  <description>Blake Harrison:&lt;br /&gt;Rich, titled, and charming…and in need of a wife by Wednesday. Blake turns to Sam Elliot, who isn’t the businessman he expected. Instead, Blake is faced with Samantha Elliot, beautiful and feisty with a voice men call 1-900 numbers to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha Elliot:&lt;br /&gt;Owner of matchmaking firm Alliance and not on the marital menu…that is, until Blake offers her ten million dollars for a one-year contract. And there’s nothing indecent about this proposal. The money will really help with her family’s medical bills. All Samantha will need to do is keep her attraction to her new husband to herself and avoid his bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Blake’s toe-curling kisses and sexy charm prove too difficult for Sam to resist. It was a marriage contract that planned for everything…except falling in love.</description>

  <description>A Jamie Begley Anthology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAVEN SENT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There wasn’t anything Shade didn’t know about his wife, or so he thought. When another man wanted Lily, it didn’t come as a surprise. What did was that she hadn’t told him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His “Angel” had been sent from heaven just for him, not for another who was trying to steal what was his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lessons had to be learned the hard way and “when you burn, you learn” was his favorite lesson to teach.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CHASING RAINBOWS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ice had never believed in happily ever after … until he fell in love with Grace. He had put a ring on her finger, trying to tie her to him before she came to her senses and realized there was nothing redeeming about him. So, he wasn’t surprised that their marriage was on the rocks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be chasing rainbows, trying to find the man she believed he was, but rainbows never lasted, and Ice had never pretended to be anything but what he was—a cold-blooded Predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t realize you don’t have to chase after something that’s already been caught.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HALO FOR THREE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer and Jonas were on the hunt for a woman to share. However, either they couldn’t agree on the right woman, or she wanted no part of being in a ménage. That they found Mika on Valentine’s Day gave them hope that they had finally found the woman that they could spend the rest of their lives with … until she disappeared the next day, leaving them with an empty bed and no way to find her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might have escaped for now, believing she had gotten off scot-free, but the bounty hunters were determined to catch their fleeing third. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not know it yet, but some halos were made to be shared.</description>

  <description>Revenge is a seven-letter word that isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a word for those who have been wronged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Turner has been waiting five, long years to finally turn revenge into vengeance. Using Rider, the pretty-faced manwhore, is simply the price she is willing to pay to satiate her desire for revenge. Little does she know, she makes herself a target from the one thing Rider has sworn to give his life to protect—The Last Riders.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you wake the soldier, be prepared for the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;Rider is going to teach her a hard lesson: revenge is a double-edged sword … and it always cuts both ways.</description>

Though there isn’t a lot to choose from in the small town of Treepoint, he has managed to narrow his choices down to three.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The strange thing is, the one he’s falling in love with remains a mystery, hiding her face and name in the messages she sends from behind her computer. The mysterious woman may dodge his questions about her identity, but it’s only a matter of time before she finds out that this Porter brother won’t back away from something he wants, and he wants her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come hell or high water, he will find the one who goes by KentuckyGirl and make her his, despite what anyone says, even her. And KentuckyGirl is going to find out the last Porter rule the hard way: A Porter always stands his ground and leads his prey into his waiting arms…</description>

  <description>My mother used to have a saying for everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You can’t be pretty and lucky.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wasn’t pretty or lucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You have to kiss a lot of toads before you find your Prince Charming.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kissed too many of those. Sorry, but Prince Charming isn’t in Hicktown, Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The good ones go to Heaven; the bad ones go to Hell.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I’m going to Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hell is paved with good intentions.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, that one is true. Why? Because ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to stay away from Calder Riggs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended not to fall in love with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to find a man who wasn’t a loser or a joker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I’ve never been afraid of Hell, anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s why I’m Crazy Bitch!</description>

  <description>One mistake can change your life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey had spent most of her life watching the Predators control Queen City, never believing they could be brought to justice. She was the one who always passed unnoticed as Max’s stepsister. They underestimated what she was capable of until it was almost too late. When the Predators discovered they were her prey, there was hell to pay, and Casey was going to have to pay her dues with her soul.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One mistake can fuck up your life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max trusted his stepsister, not believing for a second she would betray the Predators. She used her body to get what she wanted, and now Max would use the same wiles on her to trap Casey in her own web of deceit. The Predators demanded revenge, and Max was going to see they got what they wanted, even if the price was his soul.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This was one standoff neither was going to win.</description>

  <description>Beware of what you wish for; it might just come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Train swore never to let a woman get under his skin unless it meant forever, and forever only meant belonging to The Last Riders. He had believed his one brief sexual encounter with Killyama was a hit it and quit it. Instead, her green eyes haunted his memories. Then when he tried to convince the woman he was serious as his “more the merrier” lifestyle became a painful reminder of the life he lived, Killyama used his own club against him to keep him from what he wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killyama was holding out for a man who could offer her forever, and Train wasn’t the forever kind of man. He was a Mr. Here and Now; the wicked warrior in her dreams. He might be a walking, talking sex machine, but she needed more than that. So, until he proved she was the only one sharing his bed, the only part of her body he was going to see was her ass walking away.</description>

  <description>As president of The Last Riders, Viper’s only fear was losing his wife. After all, he had almost lost her once before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As wife to the president, Winter lived in fear every day: fear that a club enemy would take Viper from her, fear that one of the club women would tempt him to stray, fear that she wasn’t enough of a woman for him. One thing Winter didn’t fear was risking everything to carry her husband’s child, even her health, yet Viper refused to take the chance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Losing hope, Winter made one last ditch effort, determined to make Viper realize that some things were worth fighting for besides the club.</description>

  <description>Naughty&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? I’m not a nice person. When I walk by, people call me a slut, and I’m okay with that. I believe in calling a spade a spade. I am a slut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the holidays approaching, I miss belonging to The Last Riders. Drake’s keeping me warm, but he wants more than I can give. He wants me to trust him, to believe he can protect me. Doesn’t he know Santa put me on the Naughty List long ago?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nice&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? I’m a nice guy and have always done the responsible thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bliss is everything I shouldn’t want, but it’s hard to resist a woman who stopped believing in miracles. She wants to be back with The Last Riders, whom she considers her true family. Doesn’t she know it’s Christmas, and miracles do happen?</description>

  <description>The Porter Brother's were raised to live and die by Three Rules&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, a Porter stands his ground&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, a Porter leaves no enemy standing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sutton Creech was a cheat and a liar. Tate Porter had found that out when he was eighteen, and he had no intention of letting her make a fool out of him again. He didn’t care how much pain he saw in her eyes or how old memories tugged at his unforgiving heart until, the night a hidden secret is revealed and everything Tate had believed about their past is shattered, proving he had let the woman he loved get away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between trying to protect his family and running their pot growing business, Tate doesn't have time to play the "Nice Guy". He'd just have to remember the most important rule his father had given them: A Porter always keeps what's his.</description>

  <description>Life dealt him a dead man’s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky had always led a life of service. Always put his life on the line for someone else, managing to survive by pure luck and skill. After bringing an end to a multi-state drug ring, he was finally able to live the life he had wanted as a Last Rider… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good man would walk away and not touch the curvy woman who had been tugging on his heartstrings. Lucky wasn’t a good man. Therefore, the bad-ass biker in him had a choice: once again become the man he had pretended to be and stake his claim, or take the devil’s highway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some girls had all the luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa wasn’t one of them. All she wanted to do was give a home to the children she had made orphans. Instead, she found herself needing help from the man who had left the pulpit behind to embrace a life of sin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painfully shy and withdrawn she wanted a quiet life, a simple man, and well-behaved children. The last thing she had ever expected was for Lucky to want her size twenty body and show her a passion that would lead her straight to hell.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;King &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My good intentions always led to disaster. The cold hard truth is that I was never meant to be a father to Lily. Staying in Treepoint, Kentucky for a few weeks to get to know my daughter was meant to be a time of discovery, instead I find out that she’s married to a killer and living in a sex club. I’m going to find out how to destroy The Last Riders and give Lily the future she deserves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks I’m a whore; he doesn’t know me. I’m nobody’s fool, but he thinks he’s going to use me to find The Last Riders only weakness. That’s his biggest mistake of all. There’s more to me than meets the eye. King thinks he’s too good for me, that I’m less than dirt in his eyes. What the King of Queen City is going to find out too late is that I’m his judge, and I hold his life in my hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, violence, drugs, and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ice &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As president of the Predators’ MC, my men and I are used to preying on the weak and those stupid enough to cross our paths. So why does a straitlaced teacher make me sit up and take notice when I see her for the first time? The brothers all think she makes me weak, and believe me, weak in their eyes isn’t where I want to be. She wants me to prove she means more to me than the club, and when I fail, she thinks she can just walk away. She’s wrong. I’m a Predator, and nothing escapes me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grace &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teacher, I’m supposed to want to educate those who want to learn, right? That’s what I believed until I was told I’d have to teach a class at the prison. I didn’t move to a town labeled as one of the safest places in America only to be faced with a bunch of Predators. He expects me to trust him despite being the reason I’m trapped in the middle of a prison riot. His club means more to him than I ever will, and if I give him a chance, he will break the fragile peace I have managed to find. It’s not the first time I’ve had to escape a predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, extreme violence, drugs, and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>She needed a hero; instead, she got Cade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade was no hero. He was a nomad, a wanderer with no ties and he liked it that way. Hired out to save Fat Louise and her spoiled sister from a cartel run Mexican city was a risk he was willing to take, for the right price. With a certain gray eyed woman on his mind, he set's out to find her, fuck her and forget her. No harm, no foul. But it's all easier said than done when it comes to this plain Jane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He expected a biker bitch who knew the rules; instead, he got Fat Louise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fat Louise wasn’t about to put her crew in danger. She had to learn to handle problems on her own, even if they included a six-foot biker she was forced to rely on, if she was going to rescue her sister. She never expected to see Cade again after she'd left Mexico, but all it takes is one night with him to prove that even a bitch’s heart can be broken.</description>

  <description>If it’s not broke don’t fix it. That was Cash’s motto in life, and his life was perfect. He was living the life of the lieutenant of The Last Riders, and had women at his beck and call. The only thing he saw himself settling down with in the future was a twelve pack; certainly not Rachel Porter, who was on his short no fuck list. Hell, she wasn’t even his type—her tits were too small, and her mean mouth could shrivel a man’s dick. How was he supposed to know she was special and worth putting up with those weed-producing hillbillies? Or was she? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel had lived her whole life watching Cash break one woman’s heart after another. He was everything she shouldn’t want; a bad boy biker with enough sex appeal to make any woman want a night in his bed. Even her. Heck, he wasn’t even her type—he didn’t know when to keep his mouth shut, and he lived in a sex club. How was she supposed to know that he was special and worth putting up with the biker wars and biker bitches? Or was he? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, violence, drugs, domestic discipline, and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Want, need, pain, and joy were emotions Shade had never known existed before Lily. He knew the first time he saw her face that she was going to change his life forever. The thing he hadn’t expected was how hard it would be to hide who and what he was from her. Each step he took out of the shadows revealed more of himself, until only one secret remained. Shade arrogantly believed he could help heal the wounds from her past, but now it was his own past that was trying to tear them apart. To keep Lily, Shade would have to use the very skills he had been trying to hide from her. The skills that made him a killer … a soulless monster.</description>

  <description>Shade is everything Lily doesn't want in a man. He's rude, obnoxious and he's definitely not a cowboy. The tattooed enforcer for The Last Riders is a mystery Lily doesn't want to solve. He's too much for her to handle, especially with the nightmares from her past constantly threatening her sanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily is everything Shade wants in a woman. She's sweet, kind and submissive. When she discovers the truth about The Last Riders, it threatens to tear apart every relationship within the club. Her rebellion causes the predatory instincts to rise in the ex Navy SEAL sniper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Last Riders are threatened by another motorcycle club just as determined to claim Lily, Shade is her only hope of surviving the approaching confrontation. Could their passion be Shade's downfall? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, violence, drugs, child abuse, domestic discipline, and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Forced from obscurity and into the limelight as the lead singer of the band Mouth2Mouth, Kaden returns to the lifestyle that almost destroyed him. The last thing he wanted was to find a sexy drugged out redhead waiting for him in his bed. Finding out that she’s the victim of a sex slave ring, puts Mouth2Mouth in peril, because the only way to save the woman he’s started to love, means denying her the one thing she wants the most. Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sawyer has had one dream her whole life, to escape the smothering love of her mother and a life of poverty.

  <description>“Here comes Trouble!” Colton took one look at the stripper on stage and knew that was exactly what Vida was, trouble. He had no desire to succumb to the young woman tantalizing men with her provocative movements and killer body with no intention of satisfying their fantasies. Fresh out of prison, his tattoo shop and getting rid of an aggravating ex were his first priorities, not a woman who should know better than to become involved in a situation that could get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vida will do anything to save her friend’s life, even if it includes stripping on stage and doing lap dances in the VIP room under her stage name Trouble. All the sensuous moves were just an illusion to gain the information she needed, even if it meant the men who watched thought she would keep the promises her body was making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to sift through lies and betrayals, Colton discovers a woman who is as loving as she is loyal, but won’t give him a chance. Vida, who tries to ignore the escalating passion between them, learns the hard way that some men shouldn’t be teased…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, loss of a child, moderate violence and explicit language offends you. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This book may have a happily ever after for the hero and heroine, but will however end in a cliffhanger for her friend...&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Sex Piston wasn’t about to apologize to anyone for her bitch attitude and certainly not the President of The Blue Horsemen, Stud. If he thinks he’s going to be able to control her and her crew then he has another thing coming. A lapse in judgment has him thinking that he’s won this battle of the sexes but a one-night stand isn’t about to bring this woman to heel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stud has to prove himself as the new President of the Destructors, and Sex Piston and her crew’s attitude isn’t helping. If he has to sacrifice his body to tame the bitch then that’s exactly what he’s going to do even if it means losing his heart in the battle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, moderate violence and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Knox, a former Navy Seal, has been in several dangerous situations, but nothing compares to dealing with Diamond Richards. Framed for murder, he needs the passionless lawyer to prove his innocence. But when he no longer needs her help, he’s going to show her the passion she’s capable of and walk away a free man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamond plans on earning her huge fee to prove Knox is innocent, but she had no idea the muscled biker could bring out the passion she kept hidden behind her designer clothes. Trying to find a murderer is easier than dealing with The Last Riders and Knox’s sexcapades. He’s going to find out there is one woman worth standing and fighting for, despite his desire for freedom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, moderate violence and explicit language offends you.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Winter Simmons received the surprise of her life when she discovered the man she had been dating for the last two years was actually Viper, president of the Last Riders. A high school principal, Winter has no intention of ruining her reputation in the community to be with a man who betrayed her trust. Unforgiving, she turns her back on him, only to find that Viper is not the gentleman he portrayed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to find his brother’s killer, Loker James kept his identity as President of The Last Riders a secret from Winter. When the truth comes out, he is determined to make her see the real man who can control not only a group of dangerous bikers, but a woman whose life is a rulebook. Unable to prevent herself from being drawn into the very club she despises, Winter is about to lose everything important to her, unless Viper can prove she’s more than a moonlight run. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only.

  <description>Aka the totally lurid tale of the convenience store sex slave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a vicious fight with her slut-shaming jerk of stepbrother, Natalie storms out of the family McMansion, never imagining that would be the last time she’d be allowed in the house. A string of truly rotten decisions follows, until she finds herself suspended from school, friendless, broke, and camping out at the minimart where she works. Worst of all, her college applications are due! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a helpful teacher and her own stupendous brilliance she manages to get into her top choice college. Unfortunately, dealing with the financial aid forms proves to be too much for her supersmarts and she is about to lose her spot because she cannot get the money together to pay the deposit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gareth Boyd, an old family friend and all-around manipulative bastard, who makes her an offer: sleep with his (totally hot) roommate, Jamie, and he’ll pay for everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard can it be? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story features an eighteen-year-old heroine with a foul mouth and horrible judgment, a criminally unscrupulous man intent on taking advantage of her, and multiple scenes of bondage, spanking, ménage, and one potentially triggering scene of attempted rape. The novel is an erotic fantasy in which characters manipulate or disregard notions of proper consent in ways that would never be acceptable in real life. Adult Readers Only.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can the best of enemies become the hottest of lovers? &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds proves that opposites can be compatible—and twice as combustible…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby Reed is over it. Or that’s what she tells herself. She’s lusted after one of New York’s bravest for years, but firefighter Antonio Moretti has doused her interest for the last time. As much as she wants the arrogant jerk (in a bad, bad way), they can’t even be in the same room without setting each other off…which might be a problem now that she’s volunteered to help out in his family’s restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antonio’s been burned before. Now he knows better than to trust a pretty face and follow another pair of long, beautiful legs into heartbreak. But while Libby might rub him the wrong way, he can’t deny the heat between them. And it only burns hotter when she steps up in his time of need. The closer they get, the more he realizes he may have misjudged her. Then again, he doesn’t know the secret Libby’s keeping that could send their relationship up in flames before it’s even begun.</description>

  <description>When I was five years old I told Toren Grace I was going to marry him when I grew up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned eighteen I made it clear I still felt the same. The problem? He's fifteen years older than me and he's my father's best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toren Grace. My father's best friend. My pseudo-uncle. &lt;br /&gt;He's always been my rock. The one I should never, ever want. &lt;br /&gt;But I do want him, and I love him. &lt;br /&gt;I always have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tor's one of the good guys. Loving. Devoted. A strong moral compass. One kiss between us rocked him clear off his axis. Now we can't forget how that kiss felt, and what it changed. Nothing will ever be the same between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know he's struggling with his feelings, but I'm determined. I'm not a little girl anymore, and we can't deny we were meant to be together. The heart wants what the heart wants, and it doesn't care about age or how we met. My father cares, though. And he's the one person neither one of us can stand to hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all being torn apart, and I don't know how to make everyone see that the wrongs are actually right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Torn can be read as a single book.</description>

  <description>I lost my virginity at age thirteen. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no. I wasn't raped or molested. Nothing horrible happened to me. I don't have a daddy complex, or a shit life that I need to be rescued from. I just happen to like boys...a lot. I like them all. Tall, short, skinny, buff, light hair, or dark, I don't discriminate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized early on that one man wasn't enough for me. It's a simple mathematical fact. Why have one man when you can have two? Any more than two gets complicated. Hell, half the time even two gets complicated. But it’s worth it. Sometimes every woman has to make an exception though, two crappy losers or one smoking hot man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night I laid eyes on Hunter Coy, I made my choice. At least until he introduced me to Mason Wynn.</description>

He is scared to claim his shifter mate for fear that he will lose control and kill him.

Together all three discover that they need each other desperately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an old enemy targets Rhys, the new triad faces the possibility that they may lose Rhys forever. It will take Moe’s physical strength, Abby’s infallible willpower and Rhys’s indomitable spirit to defeat their enemy.</description>

  <description>[Siren Classic: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, M/F, vampires, werewolves, shape-shifters, HEA]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas in Arkadia. Which could only mean one thing. Chaos! The babies are due any minute and Rian is on a rampage trying to get the Pride House ready to be featured in the Council newsletter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it’s supposed to be the "Most Wonderful Time of the Year" the newly mated couples are finding it hard to get into the spirit. Tempers are running high and nerves are frayed. Fear and doubt linger throughout the town like an oppressive, dark cloud. Will the mated couples be saying Merry Christmas or good-bye to the ones they love? Can the town avoid death and tragedy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Fate bless these couples twice in one year? Who will receive Gifts of Fate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE! Gifts of Fate is a holiday reunion book in the Kindred of Arcadia series and includes mixed romantic pairings. It is not stand-alone. We recommend reading this book after books 1-6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Siren Erotic Romance</description>

  <description>Felix Kilpatrick survived years of hell in a mad Alpha’s cage and has finally made it to the safety of Arkadia. To make things even better, his best friend Sebastian has also found his way to Arkadia and offered to let him live with the Arkadian lion’s pride. He is living it up when he meets his mate. One overly neat, OCD, fastidious doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Maddox Claybourne is content with his life in Arkadia. He tends to the occasional broken bone or contusion that is commonplace in a shifter only town. He is not prepared for a redheaded mate that wrecks his clinic, ignores his orders, and tries to serve him microwavable pizza!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take every ounce of skill between Felix and Claybourne to combat a mysterious illness that threatens to steal away the lives of those most precious in Arkadia. No one is safe when people begin to fall ill. Can Felix and Claybourne discover a cure in time? And when they can’t, can they live with the deaths this virus will leave in its wake?</description>

  <description>Vivian Mercy has been running from the past for so long she doesn’t know any other way of life. When a panicked call comes from one of her only friends she finds herself returning to the city of her nightmares where her dedication as a doctor and resolve to help others is put to the test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Etain Vi’Aerlin has been watching over Noctem Falls for centuries. Sent by his queen he became a silent sentinel in the shadows helping Magnus whenever he could. While the sickness around him claims more lives he discovers what it feels like to be helpless, as an ancient warrior he doesn’t have the skills to fight this unseen enemy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At any other time finding a mate would be cause for celebration, but Etain wants Vivian as far from Noctem Falls as possible, unfortunately, as the only doctor with an intimate knowledge of diseases she has to stay in the city, and finds herself working tirelessly to discover a cure in the middle of the deadly chaos sweeping the levels. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Vivian’s past is revealed she finds herself not only combating the terrible virus but also the rebellious faction of the Founding Families. Etain vows to stand by her, even if it means abandoning the post assigned by his queen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s a race against time to unravel the lethal secrets the virus is hiding before the city itself is lost forever.</description>

  <description>When a mysterious illness begins to sweep through Noctem Falls affecting the children, Eleanor Kimball is called to the city to see if she can determine what is wrong. As a pediatrician Eleanor loves children and desires many of her own, however, after several dating disasters she has not only sworn off men, but has given up her dream of a family, and the promise of a destined mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After discovering Grant in Noctem Falls she is faced with her own insecurities and finds it hard to believe in his love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grant Douglas is a man of few words and doesn’t do well surrounded by others. He is scared to death of finding a mate. He believes the harshness of his past, where he struggled to survive, didn’t cultivate a gentle heart. After a series of terrifying nightmares where his mate is at risk, Grant has decided he doesn’t want a mate at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When he meets Ellie, he realizes there are some things worth fighting for. Even if it means putting himself out there by becoming the Alpha he was born to be and facing the power he desperately tries to hide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Ellie starts to believe in Grant’s love it will take every ounce their combined strength to discover why the shifter children are suddenly falling ill before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>Declan Lionhart has been running interference between the Founding Families and the citizens of Noctem Falls since the day he arrived in the city. His hopes of being a simple unit warrior crumbles in the face of their troubles and it looks like he will always be bound by his family’s political legacy. But with current tensions skyrocketing to unimaginable levels, Declan’s laid back persona and easy smile are needed now more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kari Delaney has finally achieved everything she’s ever wanted. The business she created from scratch is booming and she has her dream custom built condo in the heart of the small town where she was raised. But all that changes the day she gets her evacuation notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a vampire, Kari hates Noctem Falls and the politics that permeates every aspect of life within the city. Under protest she and her younger brother leave for the City of the Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan is smitten with his little general and the strength she exudes. But when it’s just the two of them he begins to break down her carefully constructed walls and shows her that even though he’s easy going, he is still an Alpha, and his lion is demanding her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the entire city erupts into chaos with matings being dissolved and Founding Families making alliances, Declan realizes it will take every trick he learned at his father’s knee to maneuver through the murky political waters swirling around them. Both he and his mate race against time to keep the people of the city safe, despite homesick children, disastrous dinners, Meryn’s wacky revenge plans and an unexpected pairing.</description>

  <description>The next chapter in the Bewitched and Bewildered series is about to begin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meryn and Beth have been summoned by Beth’s uncle and council elder, Magnus Rioux to the vampire’s pillar city of Noctem Falls. Meryn in a city of vampires, what could go wrong? Aiden and Gavriel are about to find out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva Mae Miller has been around for a long time. But never in all of her centuries has she ever had to turn to vampires for sanctuary. But when whole paranormal families begin disappearing in her quiet Texas suburb, Eva knows that it’s time to set her pride aside and join the other refugees heading to Noctem Falls for protection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adriel Aristaios doesn’t know what to make of the small human his commander is mated to. Bethy assures him that Meryn is sane, but he’s not so sure. Magnus must be out of his mind bringing a pregnant human and precious Bethy back to the City of the Night, just as things are about to get ugly. To complicate matters he’s pretty sure the sassy, blonde shifter who has just arrived is his mate. How can he possibly do his duty and protect their Prince, when he has not only his commander’s mate and little Bethy to guard, but also the woman who has stolen his heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When racial tensions threaten to boil over and sink the city in chaos, Adriel surprisingly finds himself relying on wacky little Meryn and his mate to help keep things from turning violent. But as more information comes to light, it’s clear that someone is out to destroy his city. The question is will they find them in time?</description>

  <description>Two hundred years ago Kendrick Ashwood had a premonition that showed him the gruesome image of his baby brother being killed in the line of duty while serving with the Alpha Unit. When centuries go by and Keelan is still alive and well, he begins to relax. He believes that his prayers sent to the Gods to make him wrong this one time have been answered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kendrick feels his godsdaughter’s magic flare out of control he immediately merges with her in an attempt to rein it in. That is when he learns of the tragedy that has taken his only family away from him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using every resource at his disposal he immediately heads for Lycaonia to find out for himself who would be suicidal enough to harm his brother. What he finds shocks him to his core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Bennett gets a phone call that changes her life. Her new best friend Keelan has been hurt and his commander is asking her to move in to help take care of him. Her heart breaks when she hears from his family that the dreams she has been having of them together were shared by Keelan and that he was meant to be her mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon meeting Kendrick, her entire world is shaken. His more mature appearance and perpetual frown makes him look more like the man from her dreams than Keelan ever did. When she can no longer fight her attraction for him she confesses her feelings only to have them rebuffed. Kendrick is adamant that he would never steal his brother’s mate. But Anne is almost positive that she was never Keelan’s mate to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Alpha Unit races to find the enemies who have stolen Keelan’s soul and covered Lycaonia in black magic, Kendrick begins to uncover dreadful truth behind the necklaces. When turning to Anne feels more natural than it should, Kendrick faces the fact that Anne truly is his mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the paranormal world teeters on the brink of chaos, he finds himself protecting not his brother’s mate, but his own.</description>

  <description>Amelia has dreamt of her mate since she was a little girl. All her life visions of a golden prince have warmed her heart and promised a fairy-tale future. She longs for the day when they will finally be together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the fateful day arrives and she meets Darian for the first time, she is nearly destroyed by his unequivocal rejection. His continued denial of their destined relationship has her doubting her own self worth and the visions she has had all her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darian is teetering on the edge. He refuses to acknowledge Amelia as his mate and shadows continue to spread across his heart. He has grown used to the emptiness in his soul and almost fears the barrage of emotions she elicits. When an unexpected tragedy sends Darian spiraling into a hopeless abyss, will Amelia have the strength to pull him out, or will she succumb to her own darkness?</description>

  <description>Fun loving wolf-shifter Colton Albright’s usual concern…his next meal, has been replaced by haunted dreams. The nightly visions of the sad, anxious face of his mate have this jovial jokester withdrawing from his fellow Alpha Unit members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rheia Bradley is a dedicated professional that lives to help others, but has long forgotten how to help herself. When she arrives in Lycaonia seeking the protection of the warrior units, Colton is ecstatic to discover that she’s his mate. His relief is quickly eclipsed by one small problem, a tiny, solemn four-year-old girl who happens to be his mate’s adopted daughter. Which means… he is now a father!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Rheia settles into her new job, Colton and all his fellow warriors are about to get a crash course on little girls. The men quickly learn that not one ounce of their centuries-long training has prepared any them for this precocious child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rheia uncovers something about their enemy that puts her name next to her daughter’s on their hit list, Colton is willing to do anything to keep his new family safe. But will it be enough?</description>

  <description>Gavriel Ambrosios has been dreaming of his accident prone mate for weeks. Now that he is nearing the apex of his vampiric transition, she has made her way to Lycaonia, just when he is at his most dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Monroe was planning on staying in Lycaonia while humans forgot about the swan dive she took out of her boss’s office window. Little did she know that this short side trip was about to become permanent. Gavriel is the mate she has always dreamed of. Even as he sweeps her off her feet his need to protect her has him pushing her away. She’s both concerned with and drawn to his darker nature, but is determined to see him through his transition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shadows their enemy has targeted Gavriel when they know he is at his most vulnerable. They creep ever closer to the Alpha estate putting the men on high alert. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the days get shorter and the nights get longer Elizabeth begins to wonder, which is the bigger threat? The enemy or her mate?</description>

  <description>In book one you meet our delicious Alpha Unit leader Aiden McKenzie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the topic of grandchildren comes up during a weekly sewing circle the matriarchs of the founding families seek out the witch Elder to scry to see if their sons have mates. They are shocked to discover that many of their sons' mates are out in the world and are human!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearing that their future human daughters-in-law will end up dead before being claimed and providing them with grandchildren to spoil, they convince their own mates that something must be done. After gathering all of the warriors together in a fake award ceremony the witch Elder casts a spell to pull the men’s mates to them, whether they want it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden is adamant that he doesn’t need a mate and that they would only get in the way, little does he realize Fate is sending him his mate first! He meets his destined mate Meryn Evans and things go downhill from there. In the first twenty four hours she kicks, screams and knocks her bear shifting mate unconscious. They eventually discover that life before finding each other may have been good, but life afterwards is perfect, even if it involves super soaker battles and accidentally discharging hand grenades.</description>

  <description>The best way to keep your word is never to give it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not long ago, in a chapel in Vegas, I swore to love Karissa for the rest of my days. But nobody's promised an infinite number of tomorrows. Nobody's promised forever. Sometimes, all we have left is today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carpe Diem. &lt;br /&gt;Seize the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It should've been over, we should've been happy, but people are making it hard for me to live in peace. I've got so much blood on my hands they'll never be clean, and somebody out there seems to want me to pay for it. Happily Ever After always comes at a cost, one any real man would be willing to pay. But that doesn't mean I'm just going to roll over and accept these consequences. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because when it comes to the woman I love? The life I've fought for? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody is safe. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Don't say it unless you mean it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a simple concept, one I've said time and again, but something people don't seem to comprehend. You should choose every syllable carefully, because you never know when somebody will hold you to your word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not a good man. I'm not. I know. I have enough darkness inside of me to rid the world of every stitch of light. But there's one I could never harm, one light I couldn't bring myself to snuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karissa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks I'm a monster, and maybe I am. I taunt her with my touch, get a thrill out of torturing her soul. But I'm not the only one. The world is full of monsters, and I'm not the most dangerous one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even close…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God help me, I love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And God help anyone who tries to take her from me.</description>

  <description>Ignazio Vitale is not a good man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it, the first time I see him, sense the air of danger that surrounds the man. He has a way of commanding attention, of taking control, of knowing what I'm thinking before I even do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's alarming and alluring. It's dark and deadly. It's everything I've ever wanted but the last thing I truly need. Obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take him long to draw me into his web, charming me into his bed and trapping me in his life, a life I know nothing about until it's too late. He has secrets, secrets I can't fathom, secrets that make it so I can't walk away, no matter how much I beg him to let me go. I see it sometimes in his eyes, a darkness that's both terrifying and thrilling. He's a monster, wrapped up in a pretty package, and what I find when I unmask him changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to hate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't stop me from loving him, too.</description>

  <description>I shouldn’t have remembered him.&lt;br /&gt;He was just a guy who walked through a restaurant. I didn't know his name. We never made eye contact. There was no connection between us at all.&lt;br /&gt;But I could feel him.&lt;br /&gt;The tingle down my spine. The command in his presence. The snap of tension in the air around him. That was the first time I saw him, and I was captivated.&lt;br /&gt;The second time was different.&lt;br /&gt;He was in the mysterious back elevator of my apartment building. Our eyes met for a fleeting second before the doors closed, and I was staggered. My breath was robbed. My senses on high alert. My body hummed.&lt;br /&gt;That was just the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;He was the leader of the mafia. I was about to fall in love with him, and his name…&lt;br /&gt;Cole Mauricio</description>

  <description>The Billionaire Boys Club is a secret society of six men who have vowed success – at any cost. Not all of them are old money, but all of them are incredibly wealthy. They’re just not always as successful when it comes to love…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billionaire Logan Hawkings needs a vacation. &lt;br /&gt;He’s had a rough time after the death of his father and the betrayal of his fiancée. But with a visit to a recent business acquisition—a private island resort in the Bahamas—he has a chance to mend his broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;When a hurricane blows in, a misplaced passport and a stalled elevator bring Logan together with an unusual woman named Bronte. She’s unlike anyone he’s ever met—down to earth, incredibly sensual, and even quotes Plato.&lt;br /&gt;She also has no clue that he’s rich…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronte Dawson, a waitress from the Midwest, is stranded with the hotel’s domineering yet sexy manager Logan. What’s the harm in a little fling when it’s just the two of them, alone in paradise? But after several steamy island nights in Logan’s arms, Bronte’s ready to give her heart—and her body—to the man in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she soon discovers there’s more to Logan than he’s told her…a billion times more. Now, Bronte’s caught in a whirlwind affair with one of the world’s most powerful men. But can their love endure their differences or will it all just blow over?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new contemporary romance from New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Katy Evans.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's my most delicious secret. &lt;br /&gt;The hot Suit I had a one-night stand with one evening. &lt;br /&gt;I didn't know anything about him, not even his name. &lt;br /&gt;Only that we shared a taxi, and he was staying at the hotel where I worked. &lt;br /&gt;We met in room 1103. Where he commanded not only my body but my soul. &lt;br /&gt;The next day he was gone and I only had a memory of him. &lt;br /&gt;I could still taste his kisses, feel his demanding touch. &lt;br /&gt;I searched for him for months. Daydreaming about him. Wondering if I'd ever find him. &lt;br /&gt;Until the day I find myself staring face to face with his jeweled black eyes again. &lt;br /&gt;He says lets keep it casual, and my heart knows that falling for this workaholic in a three-thousand-dollar suit is off the table. &lt;br /&gt;Because he has a secret. One that's a deal breaker for me. &lt;br /&gt;My Suit has a name. &lt;br /&gt;Ian Ford. &lt;br /&gt;And this is our story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;*This book is connected to &lt;i&gt;Tycoon&lt;/i&gt;, but it can also be read as standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Liam Armstrong gets what he wants, but when a small island hotel turns down his offer to buy it, there’s a problem. Now he’s got to fly to the remote town, find the owner, and close this deal. That’s the plan... until he meets the woman who changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole has spent her whole life on the island, and now that her grandparents have passed she’s running the Mermaid alone. She’s out of options and money with a forced sale approaching. But one night at the local dive bar, suddenly all her worries are swept away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; Deception and steam mix together for a dirty good time! This hot getaway is filled with island adventures, filthy fun, and lots of sexy dominance. Grab your sunscreen and dive in!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes the final sexy standalone set in the Beneath world of New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to believe there were lines in life you don't cross. &lt;br /&gt;Don't lie. Don't cheat. Don't steal.&lt;br /&gt;Until I learned people don't always practice what they preach.&lt;br /&gt;I turned in my badge and gun and walked away from everything.&lt;br /&gt;Then I got the call no one wants, and I’m back in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;What I don't expect is for her to be here too.&lt;br /&gt;Another line you don’t cross?&lt;br /&gt;Don't touch your best friend’s little sister.&lt;br /&gt;She's always been off-limits. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad I don't follow the rules anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***May absolutely be read as a standalone!***</description>

  <description>Look, but don’t touch…she might as well wear a neon sign that says it. It just makes me want her more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She might be above me in every way, but I still want her under me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve got no business touching her rich-girl skin, but that won’t stop me from stealing a taste. Because rules were meant to be broken—especially when the prize is so fine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world where nothing is as it seems, what's buried beneath these lies?</description>

  <description>From author Meghan March comes a &lt;b&gt;sexy new standalone&lt;/b&gt; in the Beneath series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to fall in love with the villain? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the guy you love to hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every story in my life, I seem to end up playing the villain—and I’ve got the scars to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That role works fine for me, because I’m sure as hell not anyone’s hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run my life and my empire with an iron fist—until she knocks my tightly controlled world off its axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s nobody’s damsel in distress, but I can’t help but want to save her anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we’re about to find out if there’s a hero buried beneath these scars.</description>

  <description>I was raised on the streets, so I know things are rarely as simple as they appear—especially this rich girl showing up at my pawnshop demanding a job.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the most tempting thing I’ve ever seen, and I’ll be damned if I can make her leave.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shit just got complicated … but when it comes to her—I want complicated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re both fighting our own demons, and our only chance at a future is to let go of the past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But will we be strong enough to break free from beneath these chains?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEATH THESE CHAINS may be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>I’ve always known she was too good for me, but that never stopped me from wanting her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I finally had her for one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A night I don’t remember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I’d blown my shot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now she’s walked back into my life, and this time, I have the upper hand. I want my second chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she be able to see the man beneath this ink?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author, Meghan March, continues the story of her next devastating and damaged anti-hero in Iron Princess.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a mystery. An enigma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His very identity is a secret buried beneath layers of deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also an addiction I can’t shake. An attraction I can’t fight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found out exactly who he is—a man more dangerous than the devil himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need him in order to save everything that matters to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pull back. Protect myself from the danger that haunts his every step. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which would be easy . . . if I could stop myself from falling in love with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who knew things could get even darker and dirtier in New Orleans? &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March introduces the &lt;i&gt;Savage Prince&lt;/i&gt; of the city, the man you never want to meet. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;I do what I want and who I want. I don’t follow anyone’s rules—even my own.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I shouldn’t touch her, but it didn’t stop me. &lt;br /&gt;Didn’t stop me the second time either. Only made me want a third. &lt;br /&gt;My lifestyle suits the savage I am, and she doesn’t. &lt;br /&gt;But Temperance Ransom is my newest addiction, and I’m nowhere near ready to quit her yet.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll have her my way, even if it means dragging her into the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it doesn’t kill us both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Savage Prince&lt;/i&gt; is book one of the Savage Trilogy, set in the same world as &lt;i&gt;Ruthless King&lt;/i&gt;, however you do not need to read the Mount Trilogy to devour this scandalously hot new trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Cobi Mayson knows exactly who Hadley is to him the moment he sees her for the very first time. That doesn’t mean it will be easy for him to convince her to take a chance on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadley Emerson knows she could fall hard and fast for a guy like Cobi. A man who seems to show up every time she needs him, but she knows better than to just hand over her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing his future with Hadley is on the line, Cobi begins to tie their lives together. As the invisible rope that connects them tightens and things between them heat up, an unknown threat emerges threatening to to take away their happily ever after and send them both into darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy concludes with Sinful Empire!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s mine, I keep, and that includes Keira Kilgore.&lt;br /&gt;It’s no longer enough to have her in my debt. No longer enough to own her body.&lt;br /&gt;I want something more.&lt;br /&gt;She can try to resist, but I’ll never give her up.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt;Not her. Not my enemies. No one.&lt;br /&gt;Her debt will only be paid one way—with her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt; is the third and final book in the Mount Trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy continues with &lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m his entertainment. His toy. Payment on a debt. &lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I hate him, but every time he walks into the room, my body betrays me. How can I want him and fear him in the same moment? &lt;br /&gt;They told me he’d mess with my head. Make it go to war with my body. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t realize it would be complete anarchy. &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known better. When Mount’s involved, there are no rules. &lt;br /&gt;I will not surrender. I will not show weakness. I’ll stand my ground and make it out of this bargain with my heart and soul intact. &lt;br /&gt;But he has other plans . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira's story concludes in &lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>Get ready for the darker and dirtier side of New Orleans with a brand new alpha romance from USA Today bestselling author Meghan March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans belongs to me. &lt;br /&gt;You don’t know my name, but I control everything you see—and all the things you don’t. &lt;br /&gt;My reach knows no bounds, and my demands are always met. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t need to loan money to a failing family distillery, but it amuses me to have them in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;To have her in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t know she caught my attention. &lt;br /&gt;She should’ve been more careful. &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to own her. Consume her. Maybe even keep her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to collect what I’m owed. &lt;br /&gt;Keira Kilgore, you’re now the property of Lachlan Mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ruthless King is book 1 of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira’s story is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2017 with Defiant Queen and Sinful Empire.*</description>

  <description>Every day Charlie goes to sketch a beautiful building that’s been under construction. She’s drawn to it for some reason, and it makes her paints come alive. On the day the painting is to be finished, the St. Patrick’s Day parade is in town. But a run-in between her tray of paints and a big grouchy beast in a suit has her fleeing for safety. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warren has never wanted someone the way he wants her. One chance encounter has got him searching every inch of the city for her. She can hide, but not for long. He’ll make her his, no matter what. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This St. Patrick’s Day quickie is adorably fun and over the top. Grab your shamrocks and cozy up with this sweet treat.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Amelia Green is relocating across the country to be the new physical therapist for her dad’s NFL team. She’s ready for the change of scenery, but she’s unprepared for the two hulking football players who want to make her theirs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wes and Dean have been inseparable since the day they met. They even went to the same college and were drafted to the same team. They’ve known their whole lives that they wanted one woman to share. And the day they lay eyes on Amelia they know she’s the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: These guys are over the top but head over heels for the one they love. This ménage is filled with double the alphas, double the possession, and double the ache. Come play with us!</description>

  <description>Genre: Adult Contemporary Erotic Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down on her luck, nursing student and full-time waitress Kara Foster gets a massive blow to her already desperate financial situation that will surely find her living on the streets. Needing nothing less than a miracle to save her, Kara gets rescue from an unknown, unlikely and overwhelming source. Billionaire Simon Hudson makes her an offer that is impossible to refuse, but terrifying to accept from a man that she's never met. Will the handsome, alpha billionaire really be a solution to her problems, or will he end up being a major complication and a danger to her emotional sanity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reclusive billionaire Simon Hudson would rather be behind a computer creating computer games than rubbing elbows with the elite and he knows exactly what he wants...until he meets Kara Foster. Something about Kara touches Simon in ways he's never experienced and definitely doesn't like. For over a year, Simon watches over Kara, but stubbornly refuses to admit his desire to possess her, not even to himself. But when she ends up in a situation that could very well be her destruction, Simon steps up to help her, not realizing that in saving Kara, he might very well be salvaging his own soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Mine For Tonight" is book one of "The Billionaire's Obsession" trilogy. Books in this trilogy do not stand alone and need to be read in order. They include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine For Tonight - Book 1 "The Billionaire's Obsession"&lt;br /&gt;Mine For Now - Book 2 "The Billionaire's Obsession"&lt;br /&gt;Mine Forever - Book 3 "The Billionaire's Obsession"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an erotic romance and is not intended for YA readers. It contains graphic language, explicit sex (including bondage) and other subjects not appropriate for YA readers.</description>

  <description>Aston Locke&lt;br /&gt;Whispers of the Locke brothers fill the town, facts and reality twisted to fit what these motherfuckers believe they know about us.&lt;br /&gt;That we’re sadistic bastards, incapable of any real emotions or fear.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they’re not wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I set my sights on Kadence King, getting just as drawn to her as I am the darkness. It’s the first time I’ve felt anything in a long time. &lt;br /&gt;But would she really be scared knowing the depth, the lengths I go with my brothers to make any fucker who crosses us pay? &lt;br /&gt;I need a woman who can accept me for who I am.&lt;br /&gt;For what I am.&lt;br /&gt;I’m hoping like hell it’s her, because I want nothing more than to claim her as mine…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kadence King&lt;br /&gt;I know Aston’s dangerous, know people fear him. But I want him. I’m drawn to him, just as he’s drawn to the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;I should be afraid of him, should turn the other way, but I can’t. I’ve gone mad and let him in my room, in my life, allowing him to consume me. &lt;br /&gt;He possesses me, dominates me. Aston Locke shows me what it means to want to be claimed by him and only him.&lt;br /&gt;And when he tells me I’M HIS, I have no doubt that’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;Because in the end it’s what I want too.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how dangerous he is…</description>

  <description>One old farmhouse brought them together. It could also tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi has just uprooted her whole world to start a new life. The unexpected gift of a farmhouse in small-town Montana is just what she and her daughter need to escape big-city loneliness. The last thing she needs is attitude from the town’s sheriff, the most perfectly attractive and ruggedly handsome man she’s ever laid eyes on—and a complete jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess knows all about women like Gigi. Beautiful. Sexy. Scheming. She’s stolen his sanctuary, the farmhouse that should have been his. But along with a face full of freckles, she’s got a sharp wit and a backbone of steel—something he doesn’t discover until after making a complete fool of himself. If he can earn back her trust and win her heart, he might just find the home he’s always needed.</description>

  <description>When you grow up in the most feared mafia family, it's easy to identify the kind of men that are bad news. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're the ones with experience. &lt;br /&gt;The ones with secrets. &lt;br /&gt;The ones that exude sex just by saying your name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the minute I laid eyes on Lorenzo, I knew he wasn't just bad news. &lt;br /&gt;He was the headline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion didn't change on our second meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or our third. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my head and my heart are at war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s too mysterious, too gorgeous, too wild, and now, he wants me. &lt;br /&gt;I should run far away. &lt;br /&gt;So why am I racing toward him? &lt;br /&gt;I’m totally going to get burned. &lt;br /&gt;I know it. &lt;br /&gt;A man like Lorenzo won’t leave me unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;He'll make ashes of me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and make their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six Men of Haven bleed by, taking what they want, always watching each other’s backs and loving the women they claim with unyielding tenderness and fierce&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security expert Beckett Tate has met his match in colleague Gia Sinclair. He longs to run his hands over each and every one of her lush curves. She’s wicked smart and wicked hot. He’s given her time to get used to the idea of “them,” but her time is up and he’s ready to go all in on claiming what’s his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her love of all things girlie, Gia’s no typical Southern belle. She’s built her skills and reputation in a field normally dominated by men, and now she has a kick-ass career she loves. She certainly doesn’t need a man to take care of her—especially not one who’s pure alpha. Still, Beckett’s the one man who can satisfy the desires she’s hidden under her tough exterior, and she’s hooked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letting Beckett take the lead in the bedroom comes naturally to Gia—not constantly proving herself to him professionally is more of a struggle. And when someone attacks her character and career, Gia and Beckett will have to find a balance: her willingness to let go just a little, with his trust in her abilities and his deep, primal need to protect his woman. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and make their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six Men of Haven bleed by: taking what they want, always watching each other's backs and loving the women they claim with unyielding tenderness and fierce passion.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no code Knox Torren can't break. He knows no limits when it comes to uncovering intel, especially on anyone who crosses his family. But a skip tracer with a sketchy history presents a puzzle he can't solve. When he finally meets the statuesque blonde with the intoxicating Russian accent, he'll try anything to unearth her secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darya Volkova has been living under an assumed identity for years. Searching for a job that will take her out of the dangerous life she's built, she has her sights set on Knox: the best hacker in the business. From their first meeting, though, something far more intimate than a professional connection develops.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darya must overcome still-healing wounds to trust that Knox will take care of her in all the ways she needs. And Knox will do whatever it takes to make sure whatever—or whomever—she's running from never touches his woman again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is approximately 104,000 words &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;: all the romance you're looking for with an HEA/HFN. It's a promise!&lt;/em&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and follow only their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six men of the Haven Brotherhood live and bleed by, refusing to conform to society's expectations, taking what they want and always watching each other's backs.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Raines lives on the edge of legal. A good guy doing bad things to save lives, the only rules he follows are the Brotherhood's, and there's nothing in the world that will change that. Until Natalie Jordan walks into his life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie’s only interest is in making a fresh start. She’s a woman with a plan, and the plan doesn’t include a man with secrets, no matter how kind—or intoxicating—he is. But this cowboy is determined to break down her walls, keep her safe and make her his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor had no interest in settling down, but there’s something entirely too appealing about the woman he can’t stay away from. There’s only one thing to do—change his plans…and hers. When Natalie's ex resurfaces to threaten her new life, Trevor will move heaven and earth to make sure the bastard can’t hurt her again. Except saving Natalie means outing his own secrets—and it could mean losing her forever…</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and follow only their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six men of the Haven Brotherhood live and bleed by, refusing to conform to society's expectations, taking what they want and always watching each other's backs.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeke Dugan is not a man who walks the straight and narrow. He may have sworn an oath as a trauma doc, but he has zero problem leveraging his medical skills outside a hospital if it means giving the Brotherhood—the group of men he calls family—an advantage. Blood before business. All that changes when shy Gabrielle stumbles into his life and ignites his protective instincts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanic Gabrielle Parker prefers the complexities of an engine over men. Her life wasn't always quiet and well-ordered, but now that it is, she finds peace in the solitude. When a robbery in her neighborhood forces her out of her safe bubble, she never fathoms that a dangerous, cocky trauma doctor will fix more than her injuries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeke doesn't play by the rules that Gabrielle follows but knows that he's exactly what she needs in her life. He'll show her the fierce and uncompromising protection that comes from belonging to a man like him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When tension outside the Brotherhood threatens Gabrielle, Zeke will do anything to keep her safe, and damn the consequences. No one will hurt his woman, even if it means putting the very men who saved his life at risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Live hard, f*ck harder and follow only their own rules. Those are the cornerstones the six men of the Haven Brotherhood live and bleed by, refusing to conform to society's expectations, taking what they want and always watching each other's backs.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A self-made man with his fingers in a variety of successful businesses, Jace Kennedy lives for the challenge and he always gets what he wants. From the start, he sees Vivienne Moore's hidden wild side and knows she's his perfect match, if only he can break it free. He will have her. One way or another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivienne's determined to ditch the rough lifestyle she grew up in, even if that means hiding her true self behind a bland socialite veneer. Dragging her party-hound sister out of a club was not how she wanted to ring in the New Year, but Viv knows the drill. Get in, get her sister and get back to the safe, stable life she's built for herself as fast as humanly possible. But Viv's plans are derailed when she finds herself crashing into the club's clearly badass and dangerously sexy owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jace is everything Vivienne swore she never wanted, but the more time she spends with him, the more she starts to see that he loves just as fiercely as he fights. He can walk society's walk and talk society's talk, but when he wants something, he finds a way to get it. He's proud of who he is and where he came from, and he'll be damned if he lets Vivienne go before showing her the safest place of all is in the arms of a dangerous man.</description>

  <description>When Krista catches her boss doing the unthinkable, the only thing she can do is run. Straight into the arms of the eye-candy she’s been trying not to flirt with on her lunch break. But whose side is he on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan’s security firm is having a hard time getting off the ground, and this may be just the job to help the company out. But pseudo-bounty hunter isn’t really what Pierce Securities is trying to get a name for. When he finds out their target is the classy lady from the park, all of his senses go on high alert. What do these men want with her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Krista is forced into Ryan’s sanctuary in the woods, she realizes just how wild he is, and that she doesn’t want to tame him. He may feel his methods of protection endangered her, but without Krista in his life, Ryan is crazed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is book #1 in the Pierce Securities, a Romantic Suspense series by Anne Conley, author of the Stories of Serendipity and The Four Winds.</description>

  <description>Ari Daniels didn’t count on her whole world tumbling down around her in a mess of shredded promises, broken love, and unbelievable heartbreak. Alone and stricken with grief, she shouldered the blame and eventually closed her heart off, refusing to open it for another. After all, anytime she tried, guilt and regret were waiting in the wings to remind her how painful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bet and one steamy night with a stranger force Ari to confront all she’s been hiding behind. She tries to move on, but he refuses to stand down, wanting what she is terrified to give—herself. This man may very well destroy her in the end, especially when it’s clear he has his own demons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when two broken souls come together, finally allowing themselves to believe in the beauty of love … only to have to fight harder than ever to keep it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The Armstrong brothers are wealthy, wild-at-heart bad boys—until their father’s will demands they prove themselves and marry in order to inherit their fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eldest brother Cooper channels his reckless spirit into becoming CEO of his own airline. The only thing better than the adrenaline rush of flying is his one-night stand with a stunning stranger. At first he doesn’t recognize the fiery barista he clashes with years later at an airport coffee shop. But when Stormy Halifax turns up as his new house sitter, Cooper knows she’s his Cinderella. And he doesn’t just want her in his mansion. He wants her back in his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stormy can’t believe she’s living under Cooper’s roof. Gorgeous and arrogant, he’s convinced she’ll surrender again—and he’s right. But just as Stormy is succumbing to a world of pleasure, her trust is shattered. And the biggest challenge Cooper has ever faced will be proving he wants Stormy, now and forever, for all the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turbulent Intentions&lt;/i&gt; was originally published as &lt;i&gt;Below the Radar - The Billionaire Aviators&lt;/i&gt;. This edition has been completely edited and revised, including significant plot changes. &lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Alexa Riley, a friends-to-lovers romance that will bring you the happily-ever-after you've been waiting for&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan Chen is the man behind the screen. As part of the elite security team for Osbourne Corporation, he has an iron grip on protection, all without having to make close connections with people. Until he meets the beautiful Jay, and suddenly his quiet life doesn't seem so perfect anymore. He needs more. He needs &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A workaholic to her core, Jay Rose doesn't have a lot of men in her life. Smiling in the face of her enemies gets her the results she wants at work, but doesn't exactly project a warm, welcoming vibe. So she's surprised when the enigmatic security expert strikes up a friendship with her—surprised but flattered, and maybe a little bit turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A company as powerful as Osbourne Corporation has powerful enemies, and when Jay becomes a target, Jordan realizes there's nothing he won't do to bring her home safe.</description>

But she’s never been one to do what she’s told, and she’s decided to make her own destiny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vlad has devoted his life to guarding his king and never thought about taking a wife.

Can they forgo tradition and make their own way, or will the divide break them? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Okay, okay…stop asking. They get their story. Happy now? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each book in The Princess series is standalone &amp;amp; about a different couple.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;In this "frighteningly addictive" paranormal romance saga there's a war raging between vampires and their slayers. Here are the stories of a secret band of brothers like no other—six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. And now a dutiful twin must choose between two lives...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal to the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Phury has sacrificed himself for the good of the race, becoming the male responsible for keeping the Brotherhood's bloodlines alive. As Primale of the Chosen, he is obligated to father the sons and daughters who will ensure that the traditions of the race survive, and that there are warriors to fight those who want all vampires extinguished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his first mate, the Chosen Cormia wants to win not only his body, but his heart for herself. She is drawn to the noble responsibility behind the emotionally scarred male. But Phury has never allowed himself to know pleasure or joy. As the war with the Lessening Society grows grim, tragedy looms over the Brotherhood's mansion, and Phury must decide between duty and love....</description>

  <description>The ruthless and brilliant brother Vishous possesses a destructive curse and a frightening ability to see the future.

  <description>Butch O'Neal is a fighter by nature. A hard-living ex-homicide cop, he's the only human ever to be allowed in the inner circle of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. And he wants to go even deeper into the vampire world—to engage in the turf war with the lessers. He's got nothing to lose. His heart belongs to a female vampire, an aristocratic beauty who's way out of his league. If he can't have Marissa, then at least he can fight side by side with the Brothers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate curses him with the very thing he wants. When Butch sacrifices himself to save a civilian vampire from the slayers, he falls prey to the darkest force in the war. Left for dead, he's found by a miracle, and the Brotherhood calls on Marissa to bring him back. But even her love may not be enough to save him...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there’s a deadly war raging between vampires and their slayers. And there exists a secret band of brothers like no other - six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Of these, Zsadist is the most terrifying member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former blood slave, the vampire Zsadist still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation. Renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, he is a savage feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful aristocrat from the evil Lessening Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. But even as their desire for one another begins to overtake them both, Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness. Now, Bella must help her lover overcome the wounds of his tortured past, and find a future with her…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war raging between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Possessed by a deadly beast, Rhage is the most dangerous of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the brotherhood, Rhage is the vampire with the strongest appetites. He's the best fighter, the quickest to act on his impulses, and the most voracious lover-for inside him burns a ferocious curse cast by the Scribe Virgin. Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves...</description>

  <description>As a Rock Chick, Shirleen Jackson lived through all the kidnappings and explosions. Along the way, she also watched the dramatic love stories that came with those rides unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But long ago, Shirleen made her choice. It affected who she was and would always be. She decided to settle for what she had and not want more. She had good friends. She was raising two fine young men who weren’t hers, but she loved them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Moses Richardson crashed into her life, literally… and deliberately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moses has different ideas about Shirleen. He’s more interested in the Shirleen of now, mostly because she’s interesting. And funny. And loyal. Smart. Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Moses has a big challenge on his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has to convince Shirleen of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then convince her she deserves to have more.</description>

  <description>There’s nothing like getting caught in the middle of an FBI raid to change your life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what happens to Gabrielle Carpino. Just when she forced herself to move on with life after tragedy touched her family, she finds herself thrown into a tailspin so swift, she can’t find her bearings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being cuffed and patted down by Special Agent Jude Ortiz is enough to wake anyone up. With his dark chocolate eyes and commanding ways, Gabby can't resist. And between battling criminals, flooded basements, fantasy football drafts, and her crazy Italian family, Jude also finds himself unable to resist her charms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn’t mean he isn’t wrestling feelings he hasn't allowed in years. Nightmares that are his reality have paralyzed him from living a full life. Yet, he can’t help himself when it comes to her and Jude moves in to watch over Gabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when life seems to be settling down, demons surface from the past. Horrific ones that carry a vengeance so evil, no one saw them coming.</description>

  <description>I’ve got ninety-nine problems and all of them begin and end with the Coletrain twins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially Millie Coletrain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know whether to kiss her or spank her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, she’s mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is an erotic novella with laugh out loud ridiculousness, insta-love, a smart-mouthed heroine, and an over-the-top alpha bail bondsman.</description>

  <description>My son is my life. Nothing on earth matters but him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, I’ll have to send him out into society. The cruel machine that gnashes innocence and spits out the hollowed remains of a child’s imagination. It’s a place I know all too well, considering my past. I’ve worked hard to separate myself from it, but it looms in the back of my mind—waiting for the perfect moment to strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son, Logan, wants to have birthday parties, make friends, play at the park—all the normal things that seven-year olds want to do. All the things I want to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve put up walls around our life to shield us from danger. Giant barriers to ward off possible threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora Chapman crashes through them like a wrecking ball. She’s intelligent and hilarious with soft curves and a spark that ignites a flame deep inside of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one problem—she’s Logan’s teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my past wraps its tentacles around my throat and threatens to strangle the breath from my lungs, I’m given an option—fight for my family’s freedom, or die as they’re stripped away from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t lose. I won’t lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Landon Lane and I am a warrior.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If I had known I'd have a hot architect balls deep inside of me before the end of the weekend, I'd have made time for a pedicure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's all the little things—the action plans, the long-kept promises—that started falling apart when my life slipped into controlled chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I met Matthew Walsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't decide whether I wanted to run screaming or rip his pants off, and most days I wanted a little of both. If I was being honest with myself, it was rip his pants off, ride him like a workhorse, and then run screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rebellious streak ran through Lauren Halsted. It was fierce and unrelentingly beautiful, and woven through too many good girl layers to count, and she wasn't letting anyone tell her what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless, of course, she was naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wasn't looking for me and I sure as shit wasn't looking for her, but we found each other anyway and now we were locked in a battle of wills, waiting for the other to blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes the universe conspires to bring people together. Other times, it throws people down a flight of stairs and leaves them in a bruised and bloodied heap.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Harmony Mayson isn’t the kind of girl to take unnecessary risk, but after meeting Harlen MacCabe, she starts to wonder if maybe she should be. The more time she spends with the wild and free biker, the more she starts to crave the freedom he gives her... And even more, she starts to crave him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlen lives his life on his own terms. After losing both his parents at an early age to a robbery gone bad, he knows how precious life is, and he’s determined to get as much out of it as he can. When he runs into the beautiful Harmony and finds out she’s moving to town, he knows it’s time to take his shot. She thinks he only wants to be friends, but she couldn’t be more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Harmony and Harlen don’t know is that their time might be cut short. Revenge is in the air, and someone won’t stop until a debt is settled.</description>

  <description>We met in a trapped elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmett was on his way to work, sophisticated and handsome in his tailored suit and tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on my way to the sperm bank. &lt;i&gt;Awkward, right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-five, my life hadn’t taken the path I thought it would and I was tired of waiting—I wanted a baby. And I was ready to take matters into my own hands to make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our ill-fated elevator encounter, Emmett insisted on taking me to dinner—he also insisted on something else—that I ditch my plan involving a turkey baster and let him do the job. He would be my baby daddy. He was a wealthy and powerful CEO with little interest in diapers or playdates. And since he didn’t want kids, I’d be on my own once his bun was in my oven, free to go my own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once his baby was inside me, it was like a switch had been flipped, and I got a whole lot more than I ever bargained for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This full-length standalone contains a hot, swoonworthy hero, lots of playful banter and some hot baby-making s-e-x! Enjoy.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The brother known as Hound has a reputation. He’s all about cracking heads, having a good time, and when the Chaos Motorcycle Club needs someone to do the tough job, they call on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Hound has a secret. He fell in love with a woman years ago. She’s untouchable. Unattainable. And even when her status changes, for Hound, it remains the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keely Black had it all early and lost it all not long after. Thrown into an abyss of loss and grief, she’s faced a life of raising two sons alone and battling the rage at all that had been ripped from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words spoken in anger open Hound’s and Keely’s eyes. For Hound, he sees he’s wasted his life loving the wrong woman. Keely sees she’s wasting her life not opening herself to the love of a good man.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;USA Today&lt;/b&gt; bestselling author &lt;b&gt;Kristen Ashley&lt;/b&gt; comes a new story in her &lt;b&gt;Chaos&lt;/b&gt; series...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rosalie Holloway put it all on the line for the Chaos Motorcycle Club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Informing to Chaos on their rival club—her man’s club, Bounty—Rosalie knows the stakes. And she pays them when her man, who she was hoping to scare straight, finds out she’s betrayed him and he delivers her to his brothers to mete out their form of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, Rosie has long been denying that, as she drifted away from her Bounty, she’s been falling in love with Everett “Snapper” Kavanagh, a Chaos brother. Snap is the biker-boy-next door with the snowy blue eyes, quiet confidence and sweet disposition who was supposed to keep her safe... and fell down on that job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Snapper, it’s always been Rosalie, from the first time he saw her at the Chaos Compound. He’s just been waiting for a clear shot. But he didn’t want to get it after his Rosie was left bleeding, beat down and broken by Bounty on a cement warehouse floor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Rosalie a casualty of an ongoing war, Snapper has to guide her to trust him, take a shot with him, build a them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And fold his woman firmly in the family that is Chaos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Every &lt;b&gt;1001 Dark Nights&lt;/b&gt; novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A former Russian mafia soldier is hired to protect a friend’s young daughter, but he knows he’ll do more than keep her safe–he’ll make her his. Forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;If she were to simply whisper my name, I would be at her feet, begging to touch what I shouldn’t, taste what doesn’t belong to me, run my hands along the sweet innocence she taunts me with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope Justice is eighteen, old enough to graduate high school but—according to her parents—not old enough to live without 24/7 security. Practice has made her an expert at ditching her bodyguards. One look at Ivan and she never wants to run again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve been hired to protect her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I can’t help but think that perhaps someone should have protected her from me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivan steals the breath right out of her lungs, something no boy has ever done. Then again, he’s far from a boy. This man, this man who looks like he could kill someone with the flick of a wrist, is everything. He is her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I can’t let her go and I won’t give her up. I’ve done bad things in my life, and I don’t deserve her. But I can’t do the honorable thing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve never been noble, and I’m not starting now.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Mackenzie Reed has officially been stood up. Not only has she wasted two years on Mr. &lt;i&gt;So Not Interested&lt;/i&gt; but now she doesn’t even have pizza and the Mets to keep her company. Then &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; walks into her life—more than six feet of rugged, hot stranger. Maybe, just for tonight, Mac can pretend to be a girl she’s not. After all, she deserves a little no-strings fun…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Wesley Porter is concerned, one night with Mackenzie isn’t nearly enough. She’s a mystery he wants to solve—&lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; he can keep her from running for the door every time they touch. There’s obviously some serious chemistry between them, so why is she fighting it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one sexy hookup turns into another (and another), Wesley is determined to prove they were made for each other. But Mac has been hurt before, and she refuses to fall for this sexy, ridiculously perfect guy. In fact, she has every intention of fighting it…unless he can convince her otherwise.</description>

  <description>Fate is just a made-up word used to give us hope or absolution. We find hope when we believe bad things happen to us for a reason. We find absolution when we feel as though the wrongs of our past were just fate’s twisted design to bring us to our present, and all of it was out of our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of course, I sort of change my mind after meeting Axle. The man with scars and haunted, cold eyes. The man who only warms when he is around me. The first man I believe won’t cost me my life. The first man I’ve ever believed to actually be honorable, despite the fact he’s a ruthless criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the craziest of fates could have put us in the paths of each other. More of a collision course, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life gets complicated. Shit happens. And I sort of fall harder than I thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time we met, I was in my pajamas and cowering on the floorboard of his SUV, hiding from my very insane brother. Lovely first impression, I assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time we met, I was literally skating around a bunch of corpses, because I’m slightly crazy like that. Long story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously my second impression had just as much impact as my first. Because he fell head-over-heels in love with me in that instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidding. That last part is complete bullshit. Axle is far more complicated than insta-love nonsense. Which is one of my favorite things about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about us is perfectly complicated and wonderfully disastrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s what every girl dreams of…as long as they’re as crazy as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m just crazy enough to hold on, because I don’t mind being the psycho chick in roller skates, who is flipping fate the bird when it tries to intervene again. It’s just one of my quirks. Turns out, I’m Axle’s brand of crazy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life should be really freaking interesting. Or catastrophic. Or psychopathic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it depends on how much madness you can embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Adult language&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sexual content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Violence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not fit for someone who loves rainbows in books. Never mind. There’s a rainbow in here. &amp;lt;3</description>

  <description>The conclusion of Property of Drex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s the most selfless thing you’ve ever done? What price tag would you put on the ability to save the ones you love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the worst decisions are made by the desperate or the fools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate enough to make a foolish decision to save my family. The cost? Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may be a motorcycle club, but in all honesty they’re really an elite unit of criminals who just happen to drive motorcycles. They’re a business. An organization. A fully functioning army…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’ve learned? They work in the gray area; life and death is real; and everyone wants everyone dead. Okay, so maybe that’s dramatic… No. No it’s not. It’s legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prepared for the worst, fully anticipating hating my new life. Turns out, I finally found out where I belonged. Oh, and I discovered I’m a little twisted or crazy. Maybe both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drex Caine, the man without a conscience, didn’t ruin me the way I thought he would. Instead, he made me feel like I was living instead of just waiting to live. And I can never go back to the way things used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Graphic language&lt;br /&gt;*Sexual Content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this series will have other main couples featured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover Model: Derrick Keith Shane Meacham&lt;br /&gt;Photographer: Eric Battershell&lt;br /&gt;Cover Design: Book Cover by Design</description>

  <description>Zara Edgingway is a twenty-six year old secretary. She has a daughter that apparently knows it all and a best friend that could possibly have the mouth of Satan, but she's been with her through hell and back. Then there's the hunk'a'licious biker neighbor finally showing interest in her. If only she wasn't about to face her next obstacle in life, the one she ran from six years ago; her ex-husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talon Marcus is the president of the Hawks Motorcycle Club. For two years he's had his eye on the quiet, reclusive, yet sassy, neighbor Zara. Finally, he has the chance to claim her as his woman. Just when her past catches up with her, she'll need, not only his protection, but the help from his biker brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only she'd stop fighting him along the way.</description>

  <description>When the new girl in town, Eliza “Izzy” Forrester decides to hit the local drinking hole, she’s not ready to meet the town’s good, solid guy. She’s definitely not prepared to engage in her very first hookup with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Izzy wakes up the next morning in Johnny Gamble’s bed and good girl Izzy finds she likes being bad for Johnny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Izzy feels Johnny holding her at arm’s length. But Johnny makes it clear he wants more and Izzy already knows she wants as much of hot-in-bed, sweet-out-of-it Johnny Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floating on air thinking this is going somewhere, Izzy quickly learns why Johnny holds distant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s in love with someone else. Someone who left him and did it leaving him broken. Whoever was up next would be runner up, second best. Knowing the stakes, Izzy will take what she can get from the gentleman that’s Johnny Gamble. And even knowing his heart might never mend, Johnny can’t seem to stay away from Izzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until out of nowhere, his lost love comes back to town. He’s not going back, but Johnny still knows the right thing to do is let Izzy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Izzy knew the stakes, so she makes it easy and slips through his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s before Johnny realizes Eliza moved to town to escape danger that’s been swirling around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s why Johnny decides to wade in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and the fact Eliza Forrester makes breakfast with a canary singing on her shoulder and fills out tight dresses in a way Johnny Gamble cannot get out of his head.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new sinfully sexy standalone romantic comedy from bestselling authors Lauren Blakely and Lili Valente! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about how easy it is to lose keys, phones, sunglasses and your dignity on social media, you might figure it'd be a cinch for me to ditch my V Card. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You'd be wrong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 25, I run a successful business, live in a fantastic apartment, and have fabulous friends to go out with any night of the week. And yet I'm still a card-carrying member of a club I don't want to belong to anymore. Good thing I know just the man for the deflowering job—my brother’s business partner and best friend. &lt;br /&gt;Graham Campbell is charming, smart, and, I’m told, oh-so-skilled in the sack. As long as I keep my eyes on the prize, there’s no way this pluck-the-flower project could possibly complicate matters.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Work and pleasure. As the CEO of a fast-growing company, I've been enjoying both to the fullest. What do I do when the board throws me for an unexpected loop so I can keep my business in my hands? I enlist the help of my best friend's little sister since she holds a big stake in the company. But then I learn there's another big stake she wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The one between my legs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can do this. Seven nights to teach her everything I know in the bedroom. There's no way I'll fall for her, even though she’s earning top grades in every single sinfully sexy lesson. And turns out I’m learning something too. The trouble is I don’t have the answer key to what to do when I fall hard for her.&lt;br /&gt;And that throws a whole new hitch in my plans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this new &lt;i&gt;Love Under the Big Sky&lt;/i&gt; series from a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, Cara agrees to tutor her former classmate's nephew—and learns some lessons in love!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh King is an expert at running his family’s multi-million dollar ranch in Montana. (And all that outside manual labor has done wonders for sculpting his six-foot-three body, too.) But as sure footed as he is when it comes to the ranch, Josh doesn’t know anything about how to deal with an adolescent boy—so when his twelve-year-old nephew, Seth, is dropped off on his doorstep, looking scared and acting surly as hell, Josh knows he needs help in straightening him out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara Donovan loves her quiet life as a teacher in her sleepy hometown, so she jumps at the chance to make a little money over the summer as a tutor. But when she learns she’ll be teaching Josh King’s nephew, Cara’s sweet summer job gets a little bit hotter. Cara tries to focus all her attention on tutoring Seth, but Josh proves to be a delicious distraction, while Josh’s memories of the shy girl he once teased in high school are nothing like the beautiful woman he’s facing now. Can he persuade her that there’s more between them than a summer fling?</description>

  <description>Emerly Greer has been living a low-key life, content with her multiple jobs and her books. People are complicated; animals and kids are much easier to understand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As owner of Talon Security, Travis McAllister has seen success beyond what he ever expected—causing the boundaries he's set around himself to grow ever thicker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When their worlds collide, Emerly and Travis will discover what life really means—if they can let each other in to live it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After Emerly is targeted following a robbery gone wrong, Travis and his team drop everything to protect her. Emerly is the first woman Travis wants to let his guard down for, that he wants to let in, and he'll be damned if he loses her now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book Two of the Talon Security series, can be read as a stand alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in a sexy new series featuring the hockey players of the Brooklyn Bruisers and the women who win their hearts—from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Ivy Years series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In high school they were the perfect couple—until the day Georgia left Leo in the cold...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey player Leo Trevi has spent the last six years trying to do two things: get over the girl who broke his heart, and succeed in the NHL. But on the first day he’s called up to the newly franchised Brooklyn Bruisers, Leo gets checked on both sides, first by the team’s coach—who has a long simmering grudge, and then by the Bruisers’ sexy, icy publicist—his former girlfriend Georgia Worthington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying goodbye to Leo was one of the hardest things Georgia ever had to do—and saying hello again isn’t much easier. Georgia is determined to keep their relationship strictly professional, but when a press conference microphone catches Leo declaring his feelings for her, things get really personal, really fast....</description>
