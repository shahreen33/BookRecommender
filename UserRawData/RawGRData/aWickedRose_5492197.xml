  <description>Lila never expected to have a whirlwind romance with a Navy SEAL, and she certainly didn’t plan on falling in love. Something else she didn’t expect? Finding out she was pregnant not long after Preston Lawson deployed. Worse yet, when she tries to tell him he’s about to be a daddy, she’s informed that Preston was killed in action, leaving her alone and desperate. But after years of struggling to get by, she’s finally created a stable life for her and her son and plans to celebrate Christmas in a big way: by heading to the very lodge where she met Preston. The lodge is decorated perfectly for the Christmas spirit, and Lila is content—if not a little lonely. Until Preston, the I’m-supposed-to-be-dead Navy SEAL shows up out of the blue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Preston never thought about settling down. His unit was his family. His life was the Navy. So three years ago, when a clerical mistake left him officially dead and he was offered the opportunity to use his new anonymity to participate in Black Op missions, he accepted. But when he’s given leave right before Christmas, he gives into nostalgia and heads to the lodge where he and Lila—the woman he’d fallen in love with—first met. He was hoping for some Christmas spirit, but he never expected to find Lila. Or learn that he has a son. Preston knows in that instant his life will be inalterably changed—for the better. But while he and Lila grow closer, it soon becomes clear that someone is trying to harm her, and Preston will do everything in his power to keep her safe. In the end, Preston will have to decide whether protecting Lila and their son safe means staying with them or leaving them behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This novel contains sexual content, violence and profanity.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A hacker threatens her career. And a Navy SEAL could steal her heart. If he survives his next mission.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former Navy SEAL, West Sampson can't escape the ghosts from his last mission. The fallen haunt his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camilla Delgado lives her nightmare. Wounded in the line of duty, she's trapped by her cane—and her scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cam and West forge a friendship through online gaming, but when West tries to take their relationship to the real world, Cam bolts. She doesn't do charming. Or dating. Or anything but work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SEAL never gives up, and West convinces Cam to give him one more shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught between looming threats and the first stirrings of love, Cam and West have to face their fears, their pain, and their growing desire for one another or risk losing everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes, bravery is admitting you're broken. And broken is beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BREAKING HIS CODE is a standalone military romantic suspense featuring the men and women of Hidden Agenda. Meet these former military heroes who'll show you just how steamy and heart-wrenching love can be.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; From bestselling author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp, comes an emotional small-town romance with a twist... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I was close enough to fame to touch it. Taste it. &lt;em&gt;Drink it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one more drink became my answer to everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until one night I made a mistake which couldn’t be undone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I cut all ties to my former life and the addiction that destroyed it. And I left in search of redemption on the other side of the country. &lt;br /&gt;After months building a new future, I thought my past had stayed put. &lt;br /&gt;Until I opened my front door to find she’d followed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Hastings. My sister’s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;And the good girl I’d never been good enough for. &lt;br /&gt;Not then. Not now. &lt;em&gt;Not ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One glance at Taylor’s face told me she’d come searching for a safe haven. One glance at the swell of her stomach told me she hadn’t come alone.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t hesitate to offer her my help and my home because looking out for her was the right thing to do…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if the way I wanted her would always be wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I kept my distance. And Taylor kept her secrets.&lt;br /&gt;Until one kiss changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until one kiss made me realize it wasn’t our first.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Out of the frying pan and into the fire.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;I just dodged one massive mistake, and stepped smack dab into an even bigger one. &lt;br /&gt;And it all started with a kiss. &lt;br /&gt;One unforgettable, scorching hot kiss with Nate Callahan. &lt;br /&gt;Which turned into one unforgettable night. &lt;br /&gt;And now the big sexy rescuer wants to win me over. &lt;br /&gt;And it’s kind of working. &lt;br /&gt;Only I’m keeping a huge secret that could tumble into massive mistake number three. &lt;br /&gt;Third times the charm, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;I like my relationships like I like my women, short and sweet.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Only there’s something about Mikki Russo that keeps me coming back for more. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s that sexy southern belle accent. &lt;br /&gt;Or all those feminine curves she shows off proudly. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s the way she kisses… &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe it’s the way she took me in when a rescue went wrong. &lt;br /&gt;All I know is that proving to her that I’m a better man is suddenly my top priority. &lt;br /&gt;Until I found out what she’s been hiding from me. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have to decide if one lie of omission is worth throwing away everything for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I want to make you smile like you mean it.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Cole Lannington says those words to me, I already know I’m falling. Hard. For a man I can never have. Because there’s no way in hell I’ll ever deserve a man like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I need to do is keep my head above water. Push a little harder. Keep that smile plastered on my face for my son as we try to wade through the new life that’s threatening to drown us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the first day I can’t seem to hold it all together, I meet him. And for some reason, he comes to my aid. Before I know it, Cole steps in and becomes an important part of my life. Our lives. Fills a void left vacant by a man who never wanted to fill it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad he can never be more than a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cole&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I need to do is be a nice guy to my new neighbor. Make her smile a little bit. Find space in my tidy, structured life to ease the burden she carries so she and her son can enjoy life without the bastard who treated them like they were insignificant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t expect to talk and laugh and feel a warmth in my chest I didn’t know was missing until she showed up at my door. Somehow I end up caring about her more deeply than I should. But my friendship with Annie opens my eyes to what it could be like to have something deeper. To feel something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fall in love like I mean it.</description>

  <description>With a famous NHL player for a stepbrother, Violet Hall is well acquainted with the playboy reputation of many a hockey star. So of course she isn't interested in legendary team captain Alex Waters or his pretty, beat-up face and rock-hard six-pack abs. But when Alex inadvertently obliterates Violet's misapprehension regarding the inferior intellect of hockey players, he becomes much more than just a hot body with the face to match. Suffering from a complete lapse in judgment, Violet discovers just how good Alex is with the hockey stick in his pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet believes her night of orgasmic magic with Alex is just that: one night. But Alex starts to call. And text. And email and send extravagant - and quirky - gifts. Suddenly he's too difficult to ignore and nearly impossible not to like. The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn't want to be part of the game.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes the hardest thing to protect those you love from is yourself.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Walker and Dane are a team. Best friends doesn’t even begin to cover what they are to each other. Nothing can break the bond they forged during their tumultuous teenaged years or strengthened during their time in the military. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except Joy. Dane’s first crush and Walker’s step sister, Joy has always had the power to throw a wrench in their lives even if she never realized her own allure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when she shows up at Hot Rods motorcycle shop, a newborn in her arms, nine months after they slipped and slept with her before leaving town to prevent another mistake… They know life is about to change for whichever of them is the father of her baby as well as the man who’s not as lucky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially when they realize her father isn’t about to let her live the life she wants without a fight. Because no matter their own misgivings, they’d never let anything happen to the woman they’ve both loved for more than a decade. After all, they left her to protect her…even if it was from themselves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a standalone book in the Hot Rides series and includes an HEA with no cheating. The series is part of the greater universe where both the Powertools and Hot Rods books are also set, so you can visit with many of your previous favorite characters and see what they’re up to now!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>ANGEL &lt;br /&gt;I know what you're whispering in the car as you pass me by. &lt;br /&gt;Hitchhiker. &lt;br /&gt;When you see me walking along the side of the road with my thumb out, you'll probably keep driving without giving me a second glance. You probably think I'm foolish. Naïve. &lt;br /&gt;You might assume I've made some bad decisions. &lt;br /&gt;You might think I'm too young to be on my own. &lt;br /&gt;You might be right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TRAVIS &lt;br /&gt;I love my job, but driving an eighteen-wheeler comes with a certain stereotype. When you hear I’m a trucker, a specific image might come to mind. Uneducated. Dirty. Perverted. Rough around the edges and a little bit dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;But the truth is, I’m not any of those things. In fact, I’m pretty far from it. &lt;br /&gt;You’d be surprised to find out I’m one of the good guys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*EXCERPT from Trucker* &lt;br /&gt;I’d only been driving for about a mile when I saw someone walking along the side of the road in the distance. &lt;br /&gt;As I got closer I saw the backpack and blonde hair. She turned toward my semi before sticking her thumb out. &lt;br /&gt;“Shit,” I whispered, recognizing her right away. Even from a distance, I could see the hopeful expression on her face, and I felt something twist in my chest. &lt;br /&gt;What the hell did she think she was doing? Hitchhiking was dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;For a split second, I thought about not stopping. I could just keep on driving and forget I ever saw her. &lt;br /&gt;But just as fast, all the possible scenarios played out in my mind. All the things that could happen to her. All the sick, depraved people who could be the ones to pull over and lure her into their vehicle with the promise of a safe ride. &lt;br /&gt;I’d never picked up a hitchhiker before. &lt;br /&gt;Had never planned on it. &lt;br /&gt;But there was no way I could leave this girl out there on her own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trucker is a standalone novel. Due to language and sexual content, this book is intended for readers 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Constant Craving&lt;/i&gt; comes a hilarious story about a woman who feels obligated to care for everyone, a sexy Marine who wants to make his first love his forever bride, and a fake wedding proposal that changes everything.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Cooper has come home to Paradise Beach to help her mom recover from surgery. After all, who else is going to run the family's tiki bar? A few months on a Florida island won't hurt, even if her memories might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Damien Hastings, her high school crush, walks into the bar one night. He's stunning. Intense. Way more muscular than when they were in high school. And can't take his eyes off Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Damien finds out Kate needs health insurance, he does what any gentleman would: ask her to marry him. He's going to Syria for a year as a military contractor, and he's loved her for years. It's the least he can do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn't return to fall in love. They didn't expect to have the best sex of their lives. They didn't plan on a farting dog or a fake engagement. But strange and wonderful things happen on Paradise Beach...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content warning: medical conditions, parent with cancer, heroine experienced bullying in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;ALL I KNOW is the prequel to Tamara Lush's Paradise Beach Series. They are all standalone romantic comedies and can be read in any order. If you adore hilarious banter, second chances, and steamy sexytimes, this is the book for you!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When life deals a wild card, play it no matter the cost.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since the day Rey’s defiance earned her a blinding blow to the head, fear has hovered as close as the guide dog that clings to her side. But the terror that grips her now is almost beyond description. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like her sister before her, Rey has been sold to satisfy the lusts of one of the alien Beasts that now rule the Earth. If the towering, leather-clad Alpha discovers his prize can’t see, he could kill her with a flick of his claw. Or worse, send her home—where the only mercy she’ll get is a bullet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment the Alpha Beast spotted Rey smiling tenderly at her flowers, his desire to own her, body and soul, roared louder than his bike’s throaty engine. But the only smiles his new pair aims his way are forced—and oddly off target. She is liquid heat in his arms, yet ignores the notes and gifts he leaves for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If he can’t win her over, he can’t trust her with his own truth. And the combined weight of their secrets could destroy everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***This dystopian fairy tale features one brave heroine paired with one sweet, unapologetic, possessive, protective, and kinky Alpha male Beast. If you're looking for "mating trope" with fleshed out characters in a steamy romance novella and HEA click it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Injured in the woods. Taken in by 4 hunky mountain men. They had one simple rule. I broke it anyway.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why’d I do it? Because I'm a nosy brat. I had to know what they were doing on Savage Mountain. Why were they hiding there? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when I found, out, I was sorry I’d snooped. Because these weren’t the nicest of people. Although they sure freaked nice. That made it hard to leave. Well, their tying me to the bed made it hard to leave, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sharing a cabin with 4 brawny mountain men? Yeah, it was as about as hot and dirty as you’d expect it to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This naughty, over-the-top romance includes 4 hulking mountain men with checkered pasts and doubtful futures, claiming the one woman they can’t live without. If you love outrageous reverse harem stories with a bit of spanking, tying up, voyeurism, and tough-as-nails military dudes, this might be the book for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Please note: books in this series can be read in any order. Enjoy!&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Series of standalone novels:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Captive&lt;br /&gt;2) The Runaway&lt;br /&gt;3) The Pursued&lt;br /&gt;4) The Prize</description>

  <description>Charlotte &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve taken care of everyone around me, including my self-centered older sister, Anna. When her poor choices make us targets of the Devil’s Rejects Motorcycle Club, I grab her and we run like hell. A new city, a new job, a new life. It’s almost perfect – and then I meet Ryker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s gorgeous, rugged and too cocky for his own damned good. But he’s a biker – exactly the type of man I’ve been running from. I have no business getting involved with a man like him. Too bad I can’t get him out of my head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryker &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As V.P. of the Kings of Korruption MC, I know all about violence and loss. In my world, getting involved with a woman never turns out well. Avoiding commitment isn’t something I have to work at – it’s just a way of life. Then I meet Charlotte. Drawn to her kindness and beauty, I know there’s no place for her in my world. I have to let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finding Charlotte battered and bloody late one night, I go against my own beliefs, making it my mission to protect her. The Devils are out for blood and it’s Charlotte’s they want. Maybe I can’t keep her but I will put my life on the line to keep her safe. If not, I face losing the only woman that’s ever made me feel alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Note: This book contains violence, strong language and descriptive sexual situations. It is intended for readers over the age of 18</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I'm walking away from that dream.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can't guarantee your life if you keep playing.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-three, an undiagnosed heart condition sends pro hockey player Cameron Riley back to his hometown newly single and looking for work. Cam can't hide his past – especially when his heart racing is a big risk, and boy, does his new boss's nephew make his heart race. Noah's exactly the kind of guy Cam needs after his hellish ex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I want to do something new.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art curator Noah Clark is glad his beekeeping uncle hired this hunk. Cameron is a sweet, smart bad boy. Noah works hard, like organizing a hockey-themed art exhibition, and he wants to let himself love hard. Noah's busy life would be perfect with Cameron, but what's his new lover hiding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Tell me why you've been watching me.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitting Cam's budding relationship with sweet Noah against millions of bucks, Cam is offered a lot of money to abandon his new priorities: life, love, and family. The game of their lives is on the line. And after all's said and done, is it too late for Noah to forgive Cam for his partial truths?</description>

  <description>I did it. I married a billionaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reasons are my own, but the last thing I expected was to feel owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have taken vows, but I’m still determined to be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now his rules are taking over my world, but I’m not the kind of girl to just obey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one problem: I might actually be falling for him…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this marriage is going to go, but holding onto a piece of myself while succumbing to his dirty pleasures is shaping up to be the ride of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Pleasures &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in The Dirty Billionaire Trilogy. &lt;i&gt;Dirty Together&lt;/i&gt;, the conclusion of this filthy trilogy, will release on 1/12/2016.</description>

  <description>I've got a big dick and an even bigger bank account. That's pretty much where my bio ends. &lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don't need to say anything else. I've just sold 99% of women on going home with me. &lt;br /&gt;Do I sound like an asshole to you? &lt;br /&gt;That's because I am. &lt;br /&gt;And guess what? It works for me just fine. &lt;br /&gt;Or at least it did. &lt;br /&gt;Until I met her. &lt;br /&gt;Books talk about sparks flying. Fuck that shit. With her, it was like emergency flares mixed with jet fuel. Or maybe just straight up napalm. &lt;br /&gt;Only one problem. &lt;br /&gt;She wouldn't tell me her name or her number when she disappeared from the hotel room after the hottest fucking night of my life. &lt;br /&gt;Now I've had a taste of unicorn pussy—the sweetest, rarest of all pussy—and I need it again. &lt;br /&gt;So what's an asshole to do? &lt;br /&gt;I took this problem to the street. A missed connection gone viral. &lt;br /&gt;And when I find her? I'm keeping her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There's a shirtless firefighter at her door...and he's holding a baby unicorn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal rescue officer Candice thought she’d seen it all. That was before the unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or rather, unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a smoking hot firefighter turns up at her emergency centre, the baby unicorn in his arms turns out to be the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; unusual thing about him. And he wants Candice for more than her fully-equipped rescue trailer…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unicorn shifter Wystan thought meeting his true mate would solve all his problems. Now he’s got an adorable and unruly mystery on his hands, the mother of all wildfires breathing down his neck, and dark forces closing in on all sides. How’s he supposed to romance this blunt, prickly, astonishing woman in all &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;? Especially when Candice guards her heart as fiercely as she protects the animals under her care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when unicorns are real, dreams &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; come true…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so can nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;What paranormal romance fans are saying about this addictive series:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'Once I started reading I just was unable to put the book down until the very end.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'The storyline was really interesting and often hilarious. I can't wait for the next book!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'Fantastic and very unusual...Highly recommend' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'It has everything, mystery, dangerous foe, &lt;br /&gt;funny characters that have you laughing out loud.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'Zoe Chant manages to build this amazing camaraderie that jumps off the page.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★ 'I just fell in love with the characters'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you love your romance heaped high with humor, magic, and action, one-click this addictive series today!&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>The witness protection program has given me the fresh start I've always dreamed of. A new home. A new name. A new life. For the first time in ten years it feels like I can breathe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the cost of freedom is more than I bargained for. I put my foster father behind bars. It doesn't matter that he deserved it. What matters is that he's powerful, manipulative, and now he wants me dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel someone watching me. I know my time is running out. And the only other person who cares if I live or die is a masked stranger. So I'm putting my life in the vigilante's hands. And maybe a piece of my heart along with it. Even though I'm worried that he's just as dangerous as the man I sent to prison.</description>

  <description>Sometimes fate steps in and changes everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andi Stevens drives away from her home town of Seattle and says goodbye to her sister to begin a new life with her fiancé in Buffalo, New York. When her car breaks down in the mountains of Montana, she reluctantly knocks on the door of a cabin for help. What she finds is Luke Brennan, the most handsome man she's ever met, who appears annoyed by her bothering him and is also downright rude. He takes her up to the main ranch house where his mother welcomes her warmly, opening their home to her for as long as she needs to stay. Andi quickly falls in love with the ranch and its occupants, and the beauty of Montana. And no matter how hard they fight it, she and the brooding cowboy form a bond that becomes stronger by the day. Andi soon finds herself struggling with her promise to marry one man and the attraction she feels for another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Brennan isn't interested in having his heart broken again. He's loved and lost once, and he's hardened his heart against ever falling in love again. But when a beautiful woman with the most tantalizing green eyes shows up at his door one night, he is taken by surprise. As hard as he tries to stay away from Andi, he finds himself drawn to her time and time again. But she's a city girl, and engaged to another man. She's off limits. Yet, he finds his heart slowly giving itself away to this woman. Should he bet against all odds and tell her how he feels before it's too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does fate hold all the cards for the cowboy and the city girl, or will they choose their own destinies?</description>

  <description>Neil Dalton’s foundation is already cracking. Grief, guilt, and PTSD have ruled his life since a terrible crime tore his world apart last year, and he’s dreading a holiday visit with the family he simultaneously needs and resents. Then someone from his past shows up and rattles that shaky foundation right out from under him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First a war nearly destroyed Jeremy Kelley. Then his family threw him out when he needed them the most, and now he’s barely holding on emotionally. He spends his last dollar to get to Chicago and prays his former best friend doesn’t leave him out in the cold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Neil and Jeremy spend the holidays with Neil’s family in their hometown of Omaha. They struggle to deal with families, flashbacks… and feelings that haven’t even begun to fade since their last failed attempt at more than friends. As they try to repair their fractured psyches and rebuild damaged bridges, they rely on each other more than ever, but they can’t deny the mutual attraction that’s existed since before they were both emotionally battered and scarred. If they couldn’t make it work back then, how in the world can they pull it off now?</description>

  <description>One woman. One case of self-denial. One hunky best friend who wants a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the man she thought she'd marry tie the knot to someone else spurs small-town waitress, Mandy Mattson, to finally pursue her dreams of opening her own restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she can't do it alone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mandy's going to need the help of her sexy, long-time best friend, Frankie Smith. He has everything she needs--and more. She fell for him years ago, but has never allowed their friendship to evolve into something more. After all, he's "Frankie fall-off-the-tower Smith,” and she has no intention of giving her heart to a dare devil like him. But what happens when Frankie asks Mandy to take the biggest dare of all?</description>

Turns out her ‘hero’ is a former lifeguard who has no hesitation in offering the kiss of life. So not happening, right? &lt;br /&gt;But for emotionally chastened Chelsea, one touch changes everything. She discovers a desire to satisfy this arrogant, demanding tease. Unable to express her own fantasies, she finds unspeakable pleasure in serving his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xander Lawson exudes easy charm. He likes a woman unafraid to match his appetite for unfettered fun. He doesn’t do complicated or emotional. But the raw need emanating from fragile Chelsea compels him closer. He can’t resist spinning a sensual fantasy world around them. &lt;br /&gt;As passion spills outside their carefully selected boundaries, Xander learns Chelsea’s stronger than he first thought. But is she strong enough to handle the intensity he’s always kept hidden?</description>

  <description>An unknown entity, an unexplained power source... Earth was in danger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gargoyles, a winged humanoid race of warriors, had spent thousands of years ensuring the survival of the planet. Rhodack Gahnoth, leader of Clan Gahnoth, demanded his gargoyles defend the realm against a new threat. Sending his most trusted warrior to investigate the unexplainable, he was left speechless when the warrior returned with a little wisp of a female with golden hair by the name of Rina Smith. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her powers were the strongest of any being, and something was hunting her down. To make matters worse, she was under a powerful spell, believed herself to be human, and she was Rhodack’s mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once the spell was removed, Rina’s true identity was revealed, and no one was more shocked than her. She would need a crash course in the world of paranormal to bring her up to speed. One thing she didn’t need help with was her attraction to the tall, brooding gargoyle. He didn’t hide the fact he wanted her. Her hesitance was met with his persistence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Rhodack wanted, he claimed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because of who she was, a war that had no place on Earth would spill into the realm. It would be up to Rhodack and his gargoyles to meet this new enemy head-on. Rhodack vowed to protect Rina, but as fate would have it, she wouldn’t need his protection after all—he would need hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Dark. Gripping. Sci-fi/Paranormal Romance.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There’s a place from my nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A place where bad things hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memories kept me awake for most of my life. But it’s not what keeps me awake anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;It’s her. &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She calls me, desperate and pleading. Like a shining star I can’t quite find. I feel those men from my nightmares coming for her. Only she can’t sense them—she can’t see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Not the past. &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Or the future…unlike me.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until one day as I stood in a doorway in the barren wasteland in Afghanistan with my squad at my back…my star dimmed, and sputtered out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two holes in my chest now. One which bears her name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;I have to find her. I pray I’m not too late. First I have to find the others, two more guys like me. &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together we seek a North Star.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One we were born half in love with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading us back home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without ever knowing we were lost at all.&lt;/p&gt; SIXTH is the enthralling 45,000 word prequel to Oleander. The reverse harem romance comes together in the next book.  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;i&gt; The NHL's biggest bad boy is about to fall for the virgin next door...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the world's biggest dating failure. We're talking my last date went home with our waitress kind of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have an ace in the back pocket of my mom jeans--&lt;b&gt;my sexy-as-sin best friend, NHL superstar forward, Justin Cruise.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin owes me favors dating back to seventh grade, long before he became a hotshot with a world famous...stick. So in return for my undying platonic loyalty, all I want is an easy-peasy crash course on how to be a sex goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard can it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have never been so hard in my life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I want to do to my sweet, kindergarten-teaching, mitten-crocheting best friend Libby Collins are ten different kinds of wrong. Maybe twenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm a firm believer in teaching by example, and by the end of our first lesson, we've graduated to a hands on approach to her education: my hands all over her, her hands all over me, and her hot mouth melting beneath mine as I prove to her there isn't a damned thing wrong with the way she kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a month, and I'll transform Libby from wall flower to wall banger, and ensure she's confident enough to seduce any guy she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem is... the only guy I want her seducing is me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot as Puck is a sexy, flirty, friends-to-lovers Standalone romantic comedy from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Lili Valente.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bridget never expected to see Alex Ross again after her father stole from the Ross family. When Alex contacts Bridget, it isn’t to catch up. He needs her help!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bridget Boggs carries a lot of guilt over what happened to Alex Ross and his family. She had been good friends with the Ross boys until her greedy father lost part of the Ross family’s savings in a pyramid scheme. He went to jail, and Bridget and her family changed their names and went into hiding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bridget imagines that Alex and his brothers feel just as betrayed as she does by her father’s criminal acts. When she meets Alex again as a young hacker and the owner of White Hat Security, he has something more important to talk about than her father’s transgressions. A million dollars has been stolen from his company, and Alex needs Bridget’s help to track down the culprit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex has certainly grown up since they last met. The man looks like a Greek god, and Bridget can’t help but be attracted to him. As she digs deeper into the theft from Ross Enterprises, Bridget doesn’t need any more distractions. This is a more dangerous job than either Bridget or Alex expected. The thief is willing to go to incredible lengths to evade the police, and the two amateur sleuths may find themselves caught in the crossfire.</description>

  <description>This book has been re-published as "The Heart of Falcon Ridge”. It is now a part of "The McLendon Family Saga” and no longer available in print/eBook formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEAT WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; Second Chances is an erotic romance containing sex, ménage, cowboys who like to talk dirty, and some violence. Oh, and absolutely no action between brothers, because that would just be awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years after the McLendon brothers lost their wife during the birth of their twins they are merely existing. Focused only on running their ranch and raising their boys, finding another woman to share their hearts with isn't even a dot on their map...until Claira Robbins drops into their family like a baby bird falling from its nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She certainly ruffles more than a few feathers. Matt and Mason believe she is the one who will heal their hearts and their family. Their older brother Grey? He plans to live the rest of his life comfortably numb from the neck down, even if it kills him...and it just might if Claira's lethal past catches up to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they convince Grey to let go of the past and give love a second chance? Or will his own haunting secret destroy what is left of their family for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ashley:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re married, there are the things you can live with… and the things you can’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My abusive husband, Harry? He made those distinctions very clear to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constant beatings, a forced a miscarriage, and then roping me in with my father’s notorious biker gang, The Reapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky enough, I got out of my marriage in one piece. For the time being, that is. Though it’s only a matter of time before he picks up on my trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for Blackjack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He swears he’ll kill my no-good husband the second he steps foot in town. That’s sweet and all, sure, but there’s more to him; something about his stare that I can’t get out of my mind. A part of me is desperate to believe I deserve to be loved, deserve someone like Blackjack in my life. Yet, the bruises from my past tell me to never trust another man again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Blackjack isn’t like any other man, is he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blackjack:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never expected that I’d have anything or anyone to lose when I enlisted in the army. Then the blonde wild-child of the Montana’s Reapers motorcycle club, Ashley Monroe, showed up and proved that I had a lot more to lose than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shouldn’t have been a surprise that by the time I came back home after all these years that she’d up-and-left town and gotten married. Life, after all, continues to move right on along even when you’re not there to watch it go. All the same, I have a two-year-old son to think about now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Ashley. She shows up, beaten and broken from her marriage, and instantly changes everything. I’ve never wanted to kill a man so badly my entire life. Just one look at her and I’m drowning with a desire to take her in my arms and tell her she’ll always be safe with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there enough strength left in both of us for this second shot at life?</description>

  <description>For tiger shifter, Bria Norsen, her life isn’t turning out the way she thought it would. Unemployed and single for the first time in years, she’s on a mission to change her life for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad her pesky heat cycle is making her crazy. Going home with a total stranger and screwing him six ways to Sunday isn’t her normal behaviour. Neither is sneaking out of the sexy tiger shifter’s bed the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jace Shepherd might be an expert at helping cat shifters through their heats, but he didn’t expect to be helping a complete stranger that night in the club. The tiny tiger shifter’s response to his touch sets off every mating instinct in his body, and he’s more than happy to satisfy her every need. It’s a damn shame when he wakes up to nothing but her lingering scent on his sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bria is mortified when her potential new boss turns out to be the very shifter who made her purr with pleasure. To her shock, Jace hires her on the spot. Seeing him every day sends her lust skyrocketing, but Jace makes it clear he’s not looking for a relationship. He’ll help her through her monthly heat cycle but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bria and Jace grow closer, Jace begins to understand that love doesn’t always have a price. But will a terrible tragedy from his past, tear them apart and doom him to the same fate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author’s Note: “Bria and the Tiger” is Book Five in The Shifters Series. It is a stand-alone story in the series, but I would recommend reading the first four books in the series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this book contains steamy and explicit sex scenes and may not be your cup of tea. It is intended for mature audiences only.</description>

  <description>Too big. Too fat. &lt;br /&gt;All his life Eric Sontag has judged himself on his size, believing love and friendship aren't in the cards for someone like him. Tired of being alone and scared of his doctor’s warnings, he enrolls in a nutrition support group, determined to change his life. When a beautiful thin man sits next to him, he can’t believe they have anything in common, but conversation between the two soon proves first impressions aren’t always what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drifter. Loner. &lt;br /&gt;Corey DeSantis has always been the scrawny waif; he’s tired of struggling with his art and with life. Scarred by the disappearance and death of his drug-addicted mother, he doesn’t wish for love, believing it will bring him nothing but pain in the end. Now his only hunger in life is his desire to paint…until a health scare and his mentor force him to attend a nutrition class where he meets a man who piques his interest. One drunken kiss later, Eric is all Corey can think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same, yet different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unlikely friendship is born with both men wanting more but afraid to listen to their well-guarded hearts. When Corey receives shocking news leaving him angry and helpless, it’s Eric he leans on, to help see him through, while a surprising career opportunity finds Eric leaning on Corey for advice. One night of explosive passion leads to a second and soon neither man can imagine a life without the other. Life is shaped by the challenges accepted and roads not taken but as Corey and Eric walk the path together, they’ll discover the most beautiful destination of all. Love.</description>

  <description>General Travis Bains has two daughters, one who is good, and one who is bad. Everyone knows Lindsey is the good one, and Jessie is the bad one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie Bains is the other sister, the bad sister, which she has proven more often than not, until the day she gets kidnapped and brutally raped. Will Hendricks, one of her father's soldiers, rescues her and brings her home, but fears she may be nearly destroyed by what is done to her. The most important thing, however, is that no one can know, per the general's orders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie's life was always far from normal as the daughter of one of the most revered generals in the world. No one sees what the general does to Jessie, except Will. When Will discovers the danger Jessie is living in at her father's hand, he once again rescues her. Will has survived the horrors of war, but is now engaged in a battle that has become far more personal and far more deadly. Will alone realizes what the general has done and will do to destroy his "other" daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;**Due to mature subject matter and language this book is recommended for readers aged 17+.**&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's the town pariah. He doesn't give a damn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Ruth Kabbah’s world, comic books are king, silence is golden, and human contact is a pesky distraction. She doesn’t like people, which works out just fine, because the people in this small town don’t like her. The exception to that rule? Evan Miller, her way-too-charming next-door neighbour…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-military man Evan is all tattooed muscle on the outside—and a big, cuddly teddy bear beneath. He’s used to coaxing prickly people from their shells, but he’s never met a woman quite like Ruth. Blunt, sarcastic, and secretly sad, she’s his exact opposite. She’s also his deepest desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Evan’s steady patience and smouldering smiles are melting Ruth’s reserve. But when small-town gossip from her past begins to poison her future, she’s forced to make a choice. Should she trust Evan completely? Or is her heart safest alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be aware: this book contains mentions of intimate partner violence that could trigger certain audiences. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren’s romantic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so...inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Holland Bakker has invented excuses to descend into the subway station near her apartment, drawn to the captivating music performed by her street musician crush. Lacking the nerve to actually talk to the gorgeous stranger, fate steps in one night in the form of a drunken attacker. Calvin Mcloughlin rescues her, but quickly disappears when the police start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the only resource she has to pay the brilliant musician back, Holland gets Calvin an audition with her uncle, Broadway’s hottest musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until his reason for disappearing earlier becomes clear: he’s in the country illegally, his student visa having expired years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that her uncle needs Calvin as much as Calvin needs him, a wild idea takes hold of her. Impulsively, she marries the Irishman, her infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves and Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway—in the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting—will Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>In this &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel, Tom Perrotta, whom &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; calls “the Steinbeck of suburbia,” delivers a penetrating and hilarious novel about sex, love, and identity on the frontlines of America’s culture wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Fletcher is trying to figure out what comes next. A forty-six-year-old divorcee whose only child has just left for college, Eve is struggling to adjust to her empty nest when she gets a text message from an anonymous number: “&lt;i&gt;U R my MILF&lt;/i&gt;!” Over the months that follow, that message comes to obsess Eve. While serving as Executive Director of the local senior center by day and taking a community college course on Gender and Society at night, Eve can’t curtail her own interest in a porn website called MILFateria.com, which features the erotic exploits of ordinary, middle-aged women like herself. Before long, Eve’s online fixations begin to spill over into real life, revealing new romantic possibilities that threaten to upend her quiet suburban existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, miles away at the state college, Eve’s son Brendan discovers that his new campus isn’t nearly as welcoming to his hard-partying lifestyle as he had imagined. Only a few weeks into his freshman year, Brendan is floundering in a college environment that challenges his white-dude privilege and shames him for his outmoded, chauvinistic ideas of sex. As the New England autumn turns cold, both mother and son find themselves enmeshed in morally fraught situations that come to a head on one fateful November night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Tom Perrotta is a truth-telling, unshowy chronicler of modern-day America” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;). Sharp, witty, and provocative, &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Fletcher &lt;/i&gt;is a gentle but piercing satire from “the Jane Austen of 21st century sexual mores” (New York &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;) about the big clarifying mistakes people can make when they’re no longer sure of who they are or where they belong.</description>

  <description>Catrina and her family are moving to the coast of Northern California because her little sister, Maya, is sick. Cat isn't happy about leaving her friends for Bahía de la Luna, but Maya has cystic fibrosis and will benefit from the cool, salty air that blows in from the sea. As the girls explore their new home, a neighbor lets them in on a secret: There are ghosts in Bahía de la Luna. Maya is determined to meet one, but Cat wants nothing to do with them. As the time of year when ghosts reunite with their loved ones approaches, Cat must figure out how to put aside her fears for her sister's sake - and her own.</description>

  <description>With her thirtieth birthday looming, Emma Harrison finds her biological clock clanging and the elusive knight in shining armor yet to appear. She’s running out of options, especially after her gay best friend backs out from being her sperm donor. Of course, there’s always a sperm bank, but Emma fears a donor mix-up might impregnate her with the spawn of Satan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resident company womanizer, Aidan Fitzgerald, is used to always getting what he wants, especially in the bedroom. When Emma spurns his advances at the company Christmas party, he's determined to have her no matter what it takes. After Aidan learns of Emma's predicament, he is quick to offer a proposition that will benefit them both. He will father Emma's child, but she must conceive it with him naturally. Not one for hook-ups or casual sex, Emma is reluctant to take him up on his offer, but his charm, coupled with her intense desire for motherhood, wins out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon their baby-making sessions become more than just physical. Aidan can't seem to walk away from her while Emma begins to wonder if Aidan could be the one. But can Aidan leave his past behind to become the man Emma needs him to be?</description>

  <description>Allie prowls the club for a man who will use her hard and then ditch her. Hey, it's not rape if she wants it. Instead she finds Colin, who looks tough but treats her tenderly, despite her protests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tempts her, but kindness and a few mindblowing orgasms aren't enough to put her back together again. Allie has no hope for a real relationship. Two years ago her best friend betrayed her in the worst possible way – she’d be stupid to trust a man again. Besides, she has her daughter to think of, the only good thing to have come from that dark night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her rapist returns, threatening her sanity and custody of her daughter, Allie turns to Colin. Under his protection and patient touch, Allie begins to heal and learns to hope. Colin’s no saint, though, and his criminal past draws danger of its own. Allie must fight to protect her child and the man she loves, hoping her newfound power will be enough to save them all.</description>

  <description>In a world where there’s only one woman for every twelve men, a lottery is the chance for five lucky men to win the prize of a lifetime… her hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nix never put his name in the marriage raffle for a reason. &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t need a woman. &lt;br /&gt;There aren’t that many to go around anyway, not after a genetically engineered virus wiped out 90% of the female population. &lt;br /&gt;He has his job as head of the Security Squadron and it’s all he needs. He looks out for the township. He protects the few women who are left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his name is called to be one of the five husbands to the woman rescued from the badlands, he doesn’t speak up to correct the error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Audrey’s like no one he’s ever met before. &lt;br /&gt;Fiesty. &lt;br /&gt;That’s the name for her. &lt;br /&gt;She might be just the woman to handle a rough, brutal man like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing her with four other men is a small price to pay. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, the closer they all grow, the more Nix realizes he might finally have again what he lost so long ago—a real family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Audrey’s life is endangered, will Nix be able to save the woman he’s just learned how to love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A chance he never thought he'd have comes at a price he never wanted her to pay&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What do you do when everything you thought was real turns out to be a lie? How do you pick yourself up and move on? Move past the pain? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kara McClure is living the perfect life. A great boyfriend, supportive loving parents, and a full ride to John McAdams University on a scholarship. What could go wrong? But something always does. When tragedy hits, you’re supposed to be able to count on those closest to you for support. Kara turns to the love of her life, Vincent Harris, only to find him supporting the nether lips of her sorority sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luke VonBrandt is a business college student with a secret no one can know. When an accident threatens the life of an innocent girl he's secretly loved since high school, he risks everything to give her a second chance on life, even exposing the truth about what he is. The blue-eyed beauty haunts his dreams and her scent is all he can think about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luke’s wolf insists he find a way to claim her as his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Kara’s broken heart will fight him every step of the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Not everyone can handle their newly-discovered power.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Roland is an Irish bare-knuckle boxer with an attitude and a shadowy past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harriet is an MIT graduate student about to embark on a research expedition to Mozambique. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They never planned on their lives becoming irreversibly intertwined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third gryphon to unleash his inner beast, Roland is struggling to cope with his newly discovered shifter power. But aircraft are mysteriously crashing in Mozambique, and despite what scientists think it has nothing to do with the eruption of Monte Muambe. When Roland learns that Harriet is in jeopardy from the bloody Ruby Dragon, he chooses to abandon his friends to save her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though it means tracking her across the African plain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can he reach his new mate in time to protect her—and learn about the dragons’ sinister motives in the process? Or will the Ruby Dragon’s crimson flame be too powerful to withstand? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS&lt;/b&gt; is a new paranormal shapeshifter series from Ruby Ryan. There’s steamy romance, exciting action, and no cliffhangers. Each book in the series can be read standalone (though they're best when read in order), and of course each features a Happily Ever After!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;ETHAN WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam can’t take his eyes of the totem he found in Belize, and he doesn’t dare let anyone else learn it’s in his possession. He knows there’s something special about the stone figurine, even if he can’t quite figure it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Ezra, a professional pick-pocketer, steals it from him in the Denver airport. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Ezra has eyes only for the enormous sapphire set into the stone, and she can’t possibly imagine the totem’s true value. So it’s the surprise of a lifetime when she accidentally triggers Sam’s terrible, beastly transformation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bouncing between drug dealers and mohawk-wearing psychopaths, Sam and Ezra must find a way to protect the totem—and each other. Can they master their power quickly enough to escape the dragon chasing them, or will they be burnt to a crisp in an avalanche of dragonfire? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS&lt;/b&gt; is a new paranormal shapeshifter series from Ruby Ryan. There’s steamy romance, exciting action, and no cliffhangers. Each book in the series can be read standalone (although are more enjoyable read in order), and of course each features a Happily Ever After!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A priceless totem. An unexplainable transformation. And a secret he can’t keep from her for long.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since finding the gemstone figurine in a cave in Belize, Ethan’s been experiencing strange sensations: chills, body aches, and a buzzing in his chest like there’s a beast trying to escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is exactly what happens when Jessica, a temp in his office, finds the figurine and presses the emerald set inside. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now they share an impossible secret: that Ethan can shapeshift into a gryphon, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and head of an eagle. And as the one to first unleash it from the totem, Jessica is inexplicably bound to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But just when they begin to understand what the shapeshifting entails, they’re chased by a mysterious man with fire tattoos all over his body, who can turn into his own winged beast. As they scramble for their lives, soon Jessica and Ethan begin to wonder: is such an ability a blessing… or a curse? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS&lt;/b&gt; is the new paranormal shapeshifter series from Ruby Ryan. There’s steamy romance, exciting action, and no cliffhangers. Each book in the series can be read standalone, and of course each features a Happily Ever After!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Complete 5 book series! Contains the first five books of the City Shifters: the Pride series. Follow the five lion shifter Chase brothers on the hunt for true love, as they discover five independent, feisty heroines, evil villains, mysterious pasts, underground fights, family, friends, and happily ever after (times five)! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thrill of the Chase -- Feisty chef Natalia holds her own against corrupt restaurant managers and loan sharks until alpha Logan Chase purchases her restaurant and saves her life. When she learns Logan is actually a lion shifter, Nat is ready to run for the hills. Will their love affair sizzle, or are they a recipe for disaster? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chasing Trouble -- Half-medusa Eloise Deacon has two days to rescue a hyena princess or pay back ten grand in ransom money, with no idea how to do either until Benedict Chase bails her out of jail. He even sticks around after she steals his wallet, his clothes, and his heart. But her half-medusa magic could end up freezing them both if Eloise can't figure out who wants her dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Storm Chaser -- Leopard shifter Sophia will go round for round with anyone in the illegal underground fights, even Atticus Chase. The only problem is, she doesn't know she's a shifter. Unless she learns to control her leopard, her life is forfeit. With Atticus barely able to control his lion at the thought of losing her, they might not survive to find out what else is hidden in Sophia's mysterious past... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cut to the Chase -- Wolf alpha Ruby O'Shea fends off the advances of most male shifters, but finds her match in Carter Chase, the quiet lion shifter. She's in charge of her pack, her bar, and her life, but when Carter finally gets her in bed, Ruby's only too willing to give up a little control... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chasing the Dream -- Isobel survived years of experimentation in a medical lab and losing her mate young, never dreaming that happily ever after was in her cards -- until Edgar Chase rescues her from an auction and helps her dream again. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Marine with honor.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After surviving a horrific chemical attack that turned him into a metahuman, Captain Jamie Callahan got a second lease on life. For three years he’s been working for the Metahuman Defense Force and leading Alpha Team—all against the wishes of his family. The job requires his full dedication, so it’s no surprise Jamie doesn’t have time for a relationship. An enticing one-night stand with a gorgeous stranger is all it takes to show Jamie exactly what he’s been missing. When a mission to take down a terrorist cell brings that same stranger back into his world, Jamie’s life gets complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A soldier with secrets.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Staff Sergeant Kyle Brannigan was only looking to relieve some stress after a long mission. He didn’t know the hot guy he picked up at a bar was the leader of the MDF’s top field team. When Kyle and his partner get seconded to Alpha Team to help fight a terrorist threat, he has to balance his desire for Jamie against his duty to keep his secrets safe. That gets harder and harder to do amidst regulations both are tempted to break. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two men trying to survive.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Giving into passion could cost both their careers. Abiding by the rules will only result in heartache. An attack on MDF headquarters brings with it a choice Jamie and Kyle can’t escape—duty, or love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Wreckage&lt;/i&gt; is a 100k word steamy m/m sci-fi military romance with a HFN ending. There is military violence within the story that may not be suitable for everyone, as well as explicit intimate scenes not suitable for readers under 18.</description>

  <description>For months, Mace Simms has been seeking an antidote for the poison killing her mentor. Her only hope is Alec Roiten, a brilliant scientist hiding on a backwater planet. Posing as a research assistant, Mace offers the elusive genius all the help she can, ignoring the explosive chemistry between them. Soon they’re close to a cure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then Alec’s former love Byron shows up, attempting to claim a bounty on Alec’s head, and all that careful research gets left behind when they’re forced to flee. And when Byron realizes the tip-off about Alec was a ruse by his rivals to lure him out into the open to kill him, the bounty hunt turns into a three-person scramble for survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Byron wants his old lover back, Alec is consumed by a haunting secret about the poison he’s desperate to defeat, and Mace is caught between them. But she’s beginning to think that’s exactly where she belongs as the three are drawn together in their race against death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * * * * * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher's note:&lt;/b&gt; This title is an edited second edition, previously published in 2011. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book can be read on its own, or enjoyed as part of the Bounty series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Word count: 69,100; page count: 255&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When bounty hunter Gar Stitt is given a simple locate-and-retrieve mission, he’s convinced it’s a waste of his skills. His success rate is legendary, after all, and Captain Faolan Wolf isn’t hard to find. He’s the most notorious pirate in the galaxy, and when he shows up planetside to take his pleasures, he’s far from subtle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faolan never expected a hot but tightly wound hunter to walk into his private party and try to apprehend him single-handedly. And when an unexpected betrayal forces them to work together, Faolan’s even more surprised to find himself drawn to Gar personally — especially since neither of them do personal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gar had intended to put Faolan in prison. Instead he finds his solitary existence shaken by his desire for the pirate. And when the bounty hunter becomes the hunted, he must put his faith in Faolan and his pirate crew, or run the risk of ending up dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * * * * * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher's note:&lt;/b&gt; This title is an edited second edition, previously published in 2010. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Word count: 62,200; page count: 235&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He wanted nothing at all… &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he found she had everything to give… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sunder lead singer and guitarist Sebastian Stone has everything—fans, fame, and fortune. He also has a heart full of bitterness and a reputation for a short-fused temper. But an outward reputation rarely reveals the true man inside. Facing assault charges after trying to protect his younger brother, Sebastian is sent to Savannah, Georgia to lie low until the dust settles in L.A. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shea Bentley is beautiful, kind, and hiding from the very lifestyle Sebastian has always embraced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the mysterious, tattooed stranger begins hanging out at the bar where she works, Shea is quick to recognize he is nothing but trouble, but she's helpless to the way her body lights up every time his intense gray eyes tangle with hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They both soon find themselves drowning in a sea of desire and passion that won’t let them up for air. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sebastian knows firsthand secrets never die, and he’s not the only one who’s hiding them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loving someone always comes with a price. But will it be Shea’s past that costs them everything?</description>

  <description>Marley Jackson has an axe to grind with the entire male population. After having her heart brutally broken, she’s out to prove to herself, and the world, that a woman only needs one thing from a man—and it isn’t love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***CAN BE READ AS A STANDALONE*** &lt;br /&gt;Velvet Kisses (3:AM Kisses 6) Romantic Comedy &lt;b&gt;First base never felt so good!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/b&gt; bestselling author, &lt;b&gt;Addison Moore...Cosmopolitan Magazine&lt;/b&gt; calls Addison's books...easy, frothy fun! &lt;br /&gt;***3:AM Kisses - The &lt;b&gt;USA Today Bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wyatt James isn’t interested in anything that resembles a commitment. He’s self-made, secure, and happy to entertain a one-night stand any day of the week—enter Marley. Marley quickly dispels the idea that she’s anybody’s one-night stand. What Marley has in store for Wyatt is far more complex and requires a binding contract to back it. Marley and Wyatt aren’t in it for love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marley is looking to glean some expertise in the bedroom. Wyatt is looking to find some solace after a string of nameless faces that have rocked his bed. But when feelings change, and that four-letter word takes ahold of both their hearts, they’re left to face the fact they might be in deeper than either of them thought possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marley and Wyatt smolder beneath the sheets. She’s eager to learn—yet, bossy as hell. He’s eager to lay down one hard lesson after the other, yet determined to save her from herself. Sometimes heartbreak is the greatest teacher. Sometimes it leads you into the arms of the one you belonged with right from the start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Original publication date March 26, 2015</description>

  <description>Jon Beatty thought he had the best man in his ex, Craig. But in the six months since their break up, Craig's managed to find a new lover—a woman—and wants Jon to be a different kind of best man…at his wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasoning that the only way to get over one man is to get under another, Jon heads for a local club to get drunk and laid. Bartender Liam Sable is more than willing to help with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their one night stand turns into a rebound fling which enables Jon to move on. Craig, however, is having second thoughts about the break-up. While inconvenient and annoying, Craig’s antics are nothing compared to the danger posed to Jon and Liam's relationship by another, more sinister threat...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;TANK&lt;/b&gt; is the first book in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author M. Malone's gritty new romance series: &lt;b&gt;BLUE-COLLAR BILLIONAIRES&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Money changes everything...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, Tank Marshall swore off fighting. He exercises iron control to keep his anger in check. But his mother was just diagnosed with cancer and the deadbeat dad he hasn’t seen in years is back offering an inheritance and a chance at redemption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one person that keeps him anchored in the midst of the chaos. One person untouched by violence and money and lies. Emma Shaw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the one thing that Tank hasn’t learned yet is that when billions are at stake, there’s no such thing as innocent. Money. Changes. Everything.</description>

  <description>Teddy: If there’s one thing I don’t do, it’s commitment. You don’t become an award-winning photographer by staying in one place. I’m always on the road, looking for the next shot, the next award, the next hot body. Which is how I end up on Dr. James Marian’s front porch in the middle-of-nowhere Alaska. He’s known as the Wildlife Whisperer, and I want to photograph him in action. He’s reluctant at first, but I can be persuasive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon enough I have him in bed saying yes over and over and over again, but my ability to shoot and scoot is frozen by a Denali snowstorm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jamie: I always thought of myself as the marrying type. Until I got left at the altar. Now I have a new motto: never commit and never fall in love. So when a cocky nature photographer decides I’m the key to his next masterpiece, it seems like the perfect arrangement: the hotshot’s only in town for a brief assignment and then he’ll be gone. No commitment, no strings, and no chance of getting my heart broken again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem: I think I’m falling in love. Now I’m afraid that maybe I’m the marrying type after all. And he definitely is not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Jamie and Teddy's story contains scenes of delicious man parts touching, Aunt Tilly dropping F-bombs, and two stubborn hearts finding each other in the wilds of Alaska. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While it can also be read on its own, Taming Teddy is the second in the new Made Marian series. Each book tells the story of one of the Marian brothers' search for true love. The first in the series, Borrowing Blue, is available now on Amazon.</description>

  <description>A MAN WITH NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sold my soul a long time ago to pay my father’s debts. Now my life is a prison: no friends. No family. Nothing it would hurt to lose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never should’ve touched Abby. I tried not to, but she is beautiful, magnetic, sexy. Everything I want but can't let myself have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UNTIL HE MET HER &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She seduced me not knowing who I was or what I really do in the shadows. I should have resisted her, but I wanted to be the man Abby thought I was for as long as I could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But all debts must be paid, sooner or later. And mine are paid with blood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Abby knows who I am, what I am, and she’s run from me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would have let her go for her own good. But when I find out she’s carrying my baby — there’s nowhere she can hide… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*************************** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Baby, Come Back is a full-length contemporary romance and the sequel to Bad Neighbor.</description>

  <description>Owen Jules isn’t gay, and the last thing he expects is to get married to his childhood best friend. But when he moves back to his hometown after losing his wife, he finds Jude sick and at risk of dying, all because his medical insurance was cancelled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between wanting to help Jude out and wanting to get custody of his daughter back, Owen takes the plunge into a fake marriage, hoping to solve everyone’s problems at once. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Jude begins to recover and the two of them settle into married life, Owen starts to get a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; comfortable with being married to his best friend. Owen begins to wonder if he missed out on a lot by getting married for the first time when he was eighteen--including the chance to explore his sexuality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jude seems like a safe person to experiment with, but will that put Owen’s little patchwork family at risk? And what happens when outside forces challenge their newfound stability? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Owen and Jude find a way to be happy and raise Kalya together? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawn In is a standalone gay romance with a HEA ending. It does not contain a cliffhanger, but it does contain a sweet baby girl, a big family wedding, glow-in-the-dark condoms, and socks with rubber ducks on them.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jack, Gray, and Mason have accepted that love comes in many flavors and settled into a three-way relationship. Things haven’t been easy, and now that Mason has gone back to school and Gray is interested in a detective position, Jack is feeling lonely. His lovers aren’t around very often, and he misses lying around in bed, enjoying the benefits of living with two hot men. But Jack has secrets. He’s uncomfortable every time he puts his uniform on. He’s never recovered from seeing Mason held hostage, and he’s no longer sure he was meant to be a cop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While stressing over his own future and facing pressure from Gray and Mason to bring their relationship out of the closet, Jack is severely wounded in the line of duty. His recovery, both physical and emotional might be more than their unconventional relationship can bear. Jack is going to need all the courage and support his lovers can give him if he’s going to bring himself back from the dead and create the life he wants to live.</description>

  <description>Jolie Quinn is a woman in charge. Her no-nonsense attitude has made her a rising star in the fashion world and her brand a household name among the Dallas elite. Nothing will stop her from achieving her goals—not even the gorgeous British security contractor who seems just as interested in seeing her personal assets as he is in protecting her professional ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a tragedy left him broken, Heath Powell made a rule of staying unattached. But Jolie challenges him in a way he can’t ignore, and he isn’t used to backing down from a confrontation—especially when the reward for winning could feel so good. As passion blazes between them, the stubborn, confident beauty arouses more than his desire. She touches his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious enemy threatens Jolie and her company, Heath is the only person Jolie can trust to help. But working with him to save her business might put her dangerously at risk of falling in love…</description>

  <description>NOTE: This book has been published before. It is book 1 of the boxed set Pack Wars &lt;br /&gt;GENRE: Paranormal Werewolf Romance, Paranormal Erotica, Paranormal Menage (MFM) &lt;br /&gt;SERIES: Pack Wars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She failed to stop him. Now he’s coming after her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liz Wharton has one goal—to kill the man who raped her mother. Had she known Harvey Couch was a werewolf, she never would have tried to take him on by herself. &lt;br /&gt;Determined to put an end to the pest bent on revenge, Harvey sends his goons after her. When two wolves attack her, Liz is sure she’s hallucinating. Good thing Trax Field is there to stop them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trax and Dante Field, members of the Pack, have devoted their lives to stopping bad shifters like Harvey Couch. Saving Liz would have been just an ordinary day, but when Trax finds her huddled in an alley, bruised and shaken, he’s convinced she’s his mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To keep her safe, Trax and Dante hold her captive in their loft apartment. When they aren’t searching for Couch, Trax and his brother spend the night training their future mate in the art of bondage and sensual pleasures. How will they be able to convert her into embracing not only their lifestyle but also their animalistic side?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01HLORZ0K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Carlisle Cops: Book One&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer Red Markham knows about the ugly side of life after a car accident left him scarred and his parents dead. His job policing the streets of Carlisle, PA, only adds to the ugliness, and lately, drug overdoses have been on the rise. One afternoon, Red is dispatched to the local Y for a drowning accident involving a child. Arriving on site, he finds the boy rescued by lifeguard Terry Baumgartner. Of course, Red isn’t surprised when gorgeous Terry won’t give him and his ugly mug the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhearing one of the officer’s comments about him being shallow opens Terry’s eyes. Maybe he isn’t as kindhearted as he always thought. His friend Julie suggests he help those less fortunate by delivering food to the elderly. On his route he meets outspoken Margie, a woman who says what’s on her mind. Turns out, she’s Officer Red’s aunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red and Terry’s worlds collide as Red tries to track the source of the drugs and protect Terry from an ex-boyfriend who won’t take no for an answer. Together they might discover a chance for more than they expected—if they can see beyond what’s on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A rueful, funny examination of love, marriage, infidelity, and origami. Simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking, this sensational debut will appeal to fans of David Nicholls, Nick Hornby, Nora Ephron and Lorrie Moore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham Cavanaugh’s second wife, Audra, is everything his first wife was not. She considers herself privileged to live in the age of the hair towel, talks non-stop through her epidural, labour and delivery, invites the doorman to move in and the eccentric members of their son’s Origami Club to Thanksgiving. She is charming and spontaneous and fun but life with her can be exhausting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of the day-to-day difficulties and delights of marriage and raising a child with Asperger’s, his first wife, Elspeth, reenters Graham’s life. Former spouses are hard to categorize – are they friends, enemies, old flames, or just people who know you really, really well? Graham starts to wonder: How can anyone love two such different women? Did he make the right choice? Is there a right choice?</description>

  <description>Scientist Ada has a boundless imagination and has always been hopelessly curious. Why are there pointy things stuck to a rose? Why are there hairs growing inside your nose? When her house fills with a horrific, toe-curling smell, Ada knows it’s up to her to find the source. What would you do with a problem like this? Not afraid of failure, Ada embarks on a fact-finding mission and conducts scientific experiments, all in the name of discovery. But, this time, her experiments lead to even more stink and get her into trouble!</description>

  <description>Rosie may seem quiet during the day, but at night she's a brilliant inventor of gizmos and gadgets who dreams of becoming a great engineer. When her great-great-aunt Rose (Rosie the Riveter) comes for a visit and mentions her one unfinished goal--to fly--Rosie sets to work building a contraption to make her aunt's dream come true. But when her contraption doesn't fl y but rather hovers for a moment and then crashes, Rosie deems the invention a failure. On the contrary, Aunt Rose inisists that Rosie's contraption was a raging success. You can only truly fail, she explains, if you quit.</description>

    &lt;em&gt;Sequel to Change of Heart&lt;br /&gt;Change of Heart: Book Two&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jin Rayne is having trouble adjusting to the new life he’s supposed to love. Instead of adapting to being the mate of tribe leader Logan Church, Jin can't get past the fact that his lover was straight before they met. He's discovered the joy in belonging to Logan but fears his new life could disappear at a moment’s notice, despite Logan's insistence that they are forever, end of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jin wants to trust Logan, but that desire will be put to the test both by a rival tribe leader and by a startling revelation about Jin's existence. At stake is Jin's life and his place in the tribe. If he's going to survive to see Logan again, he'll have to release his fear and freely accept the bond, for only then can he truly trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;TIED UP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning home to help out with his brother’s dude ranch is cool with Ethan. After all, he’s as comfortable in the saddle as he is roping a calf. But what’s really jangling his spurs is a chance to indulge his kink in the ranch’s monthly Giddyup event. Did someone say suspension bondage? Yee-Haw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TEASED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Victoria realizes her family’s number one goal in sending her to college is to get her hitched to a husband, she drops out one semester shy of graduation. But paying her own way turns out to be the hardest lesson of all. Thankfully she’s found her way to the Hilltop Ranch. A place to get away and refocus. And get herself all tied up. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TAKEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Ethan’s pretty handy with that length of rope. But it turns out the expensive design school wasn’t a total waste for Victoria. Bringing an “academic” approach to their play—and Ethan’s hobby—is opening up new possibilities. Like maybe the chemistry between them is something more than a game. . .&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>All roads lead home when that’s where you’ve left your heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silas Compton always had his eye on Lucy, the veterinarian’s daughter. He was even content to wait for the girl of his dreams to grow up before getting anywhere near her with his family’s double-edged legacy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Waiting around led to fooling around with his best friend—and an impulsive eruption of desire that Lucy’s innocent eyes weren’t meant to see. Figuring Compton Pass wasn’t big enough for either the three of them or the pain he’d caused, Silas let loose his tightly reined wanderlust and headed for Alaska. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, when an oil rig accident sends him home, he braces himself for the reopening of old wounds. Instead he finds himself in the care—and welcoming arms—of Lucy and Colby, whose marriage has plenty of room for the man they both still love. And forgive with all their hearts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As things start to unravel at Compass Ranch, Silas must dig deep for the strength to assume his rightful place in the Compton family…and lay the foundation for a future with his lovers. If he can forgive himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is overflowing with sexy cowboys who like to saddle up and ride each other as well as the woman of their dreams. The likelihood of becoming addicted to their ranch family is high. With three more stories yet to come, beware. You won’t be able to read just one!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Abducted by a space pirate, she fights the temptation to let him plunder her goods.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boyfriend's attempted murder leaves Megan floundering in the ocean. Sinking without hope, the bright light she sees in the night sky isn't her doorway to heaven, but rather the beginning of her accidental abduction by a space pirate. While thankful of his rescue, Megan stays true to form and just can't keep her mouth shut, even when he keeps threatening to kill her — or auction her off to the highest bidder. Even odder, despite her decision to not get involved with her wickedly hot captor, she can't help craving his touch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tren retired from his job as a mercenary so he could enjoy life, but he never counted on the boredom of normalcy. The acquisition of rare items has somewhat filled the void, but his accidental abduction of an outspoken earthling, who doesn't know when to shut up, turns his life upside. Her fiery spirit draws him while at the same time drives him insane. Struggling with his urges, he must decide — throttle her barbarian neck or ravish her delectably lush body? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what his heart tries to tell him, he's determined to sell her to the highest bidder even as he seduces her body. However, despite his best intentions, he discovers he can't let her go. And when a foe from his past thinks to steal her, he'll do anything to get her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: This is an erotic, galactic romance with heavy emphasis on the romance. It is meant for open minded adults only who enjoy a sci-fi romance, explicit bedroom details and humor.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>After a decade of serving in the Army, everyone still expects me to be Dominic 'Nicky' Costigan--the skirt-chasing player. They don't know I've been spending my days trying to figure out my post-military life. Including how to pick up guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I meet Luke on a hookup app, he makes it clear it's for one-night only. That's fine with me, because I'm down to see what this silver fox can do. But after I arrive at his doorstep, it doesn't take long to realize we have serious chemistry, and we end up meeting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's got more walls around his heart than a military base, but I think he's as addicted to me as I am to him. He can't resist me for long. I mean, who can? Except Luke's rules exist for a reason, and when I test his limits, things get complicated. Maybe too complicated.</description>

After tragedy struck, Gideon Brentwood became the Alpha of the Talons. But the Pack’s stability is threatened, and he’s forced to take mate—only the one fate puts in his path is the woman he shouldn’t want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though the daughter of the Redwood Pack’s Beta, Brie Jamenson has known peace for most of her life. When she finds the man who could be her mate, she’s shocked to discover Gideon is the Alpha wolf of the Talon Pack. As a submissive, her strength lies in her heart, not her claws. But if her new Pack disagrees or disapproves of fate’s choice, the consequences could be fatal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the worlds Brie and Gideon have always known begin to shift, they must face their challenges together in order to help their Pack and seal their bond. But when the Pack is threatened from the inside, Gideon doesn’t know who he can trust and Brie’s life could be forfeit in the crossfire. It will take the strength of an Alpha and the courage of his mate to realize where true loyalties lie.</description>

  <description>After trading the barracks for a fixer-upper rental, navy SEAL Zack Nelson wants peace, not a roommate—especially not Pike, who sees things about Zack he most wants to hide. Pike's flirting puts virgin Zack on edge. And the questions Pike's arrival would spark from Zack's teammates about his own sexuality? Nope. Not going there. But Zack can't refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pike Reynolds knows there won't be a warm welcome in his new home. What can he say? He's an acquired taste. But he needs this chance to get his life together. Also, teasing the uptight SEAL will be hella fun. Still, Pike has to tread carefully; he's had his fill of tourists in the past, and he can't risk his heart on another, not even one as hot, as built—and, okay, yeah, as adorable—as Zack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living with Pike crumbles Zack's restraint and fuels his curiosity. He discovers how well they fit together in bed…in the shower…in the hallway… He needs Pike more than he could have imagined, yet he doesn't know how to be the man Pike deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approximate word count: 73,000&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Redneck Casanova"&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a disastrous marital near-miss Jade Ballard retreats to San Antonio, cutting herself off from the world in general and more specifically her family’s country club lifestyle, which she no longer wants any part of. She takes comfort in food and eventually, the safety of an internet love affair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Miss Snooty Pants"&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rowdy Yates is a semi-reformed womanizer who’s leery of long-term entanglements. Until Jade, he never seriously considered anything beyond a “Wife-For-A-Night.” After months of flirting on the internet the couple meets, only to discover they already know one another. Rowdy has always mistaken Jade’s shy reserved nature for snobbishness, and Jade has always viewed the woman-loving Rowdy as a Redneck Casanova. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the months they spent getting to know one another formed an attraction neither can fight.​ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This book contains cookie consumption, shopping, rants about bras, lost bras, stolen bras, a fake engagement, hawt sexy times, and a snooty plus-sized chick who falls hard for her Redneck Casanova.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven-year-old Rachel Stern is in a rut. Despite her mother’s best efforts, she is still single. At two-hundred and forty-two pounds, she still lives at home, the victim of a constantly-cooking Jewish mother whose force-feeding techniques have become legendary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As if that isn’t bad enough, Rachel’s Friday and Saturday evenings are spent with her parents and her Saturday mornings consist of wedding gown shopping with her also single best friend. She is clearly going nowhere. But at least she’s not alone. Until her best friend snags a boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, unable to stand herself and her weight problem anymore, Rachel signs up for Weight Watchers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finnegan Schwartz, a young man who has already been successful at the Weight Watchers program, having lost a hundred pounds, champions Rachel and becomes her impromptu weight loss coach and newest friend. Rachel soon learns there’s so much more to this funny and shy guy who she’d overlooked before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amid her mother’s overzealous attempts to fix her up, bizarre family dinners and crises that threaten to unravel the entire Stern family, will Rachel be able to find something she’s never thought was hers for the taking: self-acceptance?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now Free on All Platforms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plagued by nightmares. Stalked by kidnappers. Tamra McMillan needs a safe haven. When tattooed bad-ass Kyle Rossini steps into her life, the last thing she expects to find is a sanctuary from her demons in his arms. In fact, everything about him screams danger. But appearances can be deceiving. The tender possessiveness of his touch, the hunger in his eyes, the scorching sensuality of his kiss... He wants to brand her as his for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etruscan werewolf Kyle is a loner. The king’s assassin with a killer’s instincts. The last thing he needs is a mate who could be placed in danger because of him. Until he meets the one woman who needs him more than he needs his solitude. When Tamra, battered but not broken, stumbles into his world and tumbles into his bed, she captures his heart. And nothing—not kidnappers or visions of his possible death—will keep him from her.</description>

  <description>Can she heal from a tragedy too great to bear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Michelle Lancaster flees her hometown of Spirit, Louisiana to spend time at a beach retreat in Driftwood Bay, Florida, she only wants to run from the tremendous pain of a tragedy that caused her perfect life to shatter into pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the day when the memories become too much, a man steps into her path on the beach and causes her beloved horse Coco to almost throw her. Not to mention this is the one man Michelle has tried to avoid. But laid-back boat captain and artist Brodie Stevens has his eye on Michelle and soon, he is pursuing her with a strong-willed determination. He too is haunted, but believes that together they can heal each other. Now the driftwood cowboy must convince Michelle it’s possible to hope… and to love again.</description>

  <description>Love was never an exact science…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachael Ford’s world is collapsing around her. Not only has her fiancé run off with his in-home care nurse, but her wedding to said low-life is only one month away. Since she’d rather swallow a box full of nails than live up to her family nickname of “Wreck-it Rachael,” she’ll have to find someone to convince her parents she’s no longer the same flakey girl she used to be or run back home with her tail between her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…but there’s no denying their chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garret Adams can’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with his dating algorithm. He’s tried everything to make sure his company, Organic Chemistry, is the leader in match making, but there’s no denying something is missing. So, when his right-hand employee threatens to leave after her botched engagement, he offers to help her out. He’ll go through with her sham marriage if and only if she agrees to be his science project. The only problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their attraction is one variable he hadn’t accounted for.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing her maybe-mobster boss murder a guy, Delaney James assumes a new identity and pretends to be a mail order bride. She finds her groom-to-be living in a town that celebrates Halloween every day. Weird. But not as weird as what she doesn’t know. Her groom-to-be is a 400-year-old vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Ellingham has only agreed to the arranged set up to make his overbearing grandmother happy. In thirty days, whatever bridezilla shows up at his door will be escorted right back out. His past means love is no longer an option. Not if the woman’s going to have a future. Except he never counted on Delaney and falling in love for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad both of them are keeping some mighty big secrets...</description>

  <description>In the New York Times bestseller that the Washington Post called “Lean In for misfits,” Sophia Amoruso shares how she went from dumpster diving to founding one of the fastest-growing retailers in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amoruso spent her teens hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and scrounging in dumpsters for leftover bagels. By age twenty-two she had dropped out of school, and was broke, directionless, and checking IDs in the lobby of an art school—a job she’d taken for the health insurance. It was in that lobby that Sophia decided to start selling vintage clothes on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward to today, and she’s the founder of Nasty Gal and the founder and CEO of Girlboss. Sophia was never a typical CEO, or a typical anything, and she’s written #GIRLBOSS for other girls like her: outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success, even when that path is windy as all hell and lined with naysayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GIRLBOSS proves that being successful isn’t about where you went to college or how popular you were in high school. It’s about trusting your instincts and following your gut; knowing which rules to follow and which to break; when to button up and when to let your freak flag fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A witty and cleverly told account . . . It’s this kind of honest advice, plus the humorous ups and downs of her rise in online retail, that make the book so appealing.” —Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Amoruso teaches the innovative and entrepreneurial among us to play to our strengths, learn from our mistakes, and know when to break a few of the traditional rules.” —Vanity Fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“#GIRLBOSS is more than a book . . . #GIRLBOSS is a movement.” —Lena Dunham</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.</description>

  <description>A poignant and unforgettable tale of love, loss, and moving on . . . with the help of one not-so-little dog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocky's husband Bob was just forty-two when she discovered him lying cold and lifeless on the bathroom floor . . . and Rocky's world changed forever. Quitting her job, chopping off all her hair, she leaves Massachusetts—reinventing her past and taking a job as Animal Control Warden on Peak's Island, a tiny speck off the coast of Maine and a million miles away from everything she's lost. She leaves her career as a psychologist behind, only to find friendship with a woman whose brain misfires in the most wonderful way and a young girl who is trying to disappear. Rocky, a quirky and fallible character, discovers the healing process to be agonizingly slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Lloyd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large black Labrador retriever, Lloyd enters Rocky's world with a primitive arrow sticking out of his shoulder. And so begins a remarkable friendship between a wounded woman and a wounded, lovable beast. As the unraveling mystery of Lloyd's accident and missing owner leads Rocky to an archery instructor who draws her in even as she finds every reason to mistrust him, she discovers the life-altering revelation that grief can be transformed . . . and joy &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Once a week, an eclectic group of women comes together at a New York City yarn shop to work on their latest projects - and share the stories of their lives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of Walker and Daughter is the shop's owner, Georgia, who is overwhelmed with juggling the store and single-handedly raising her teenage daughter. Happy to escape the demands of her life, she looks forward to her Friday Night Knitting Club, where she and her friends - Anita, Peri, Darwin, Lucie, and K.C. - exchange knitting tips, jokes, and their deepest secrets. But when the man who once broke Georgia's heart suddenly shows up, demanding a role in their daughter's life, her world is shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Georgia's friends are there for encouragement, sharing their own tales of intimacy, heartbreak, and miracle making. And when the unthinkable happens, these women will discover that what they've created isn't just a knitting club; its a sisterhood.</description>

  <description>Joe Cantrell, owner of the Gansett Island Ferry Company, has been in love with Janey McCarthy for as long as he can remember. At the same time, Janey has been dating or engaged to doctor-in-training David Lawrence. When things go horribly wrong between David and Janey, she calls her “fifth brother” Joe, one of the few people in her close circle who lives on the mainland. Janey decides a few days with Joe is just what she needs before she goes home to the island to face her parents and family with the news of her broken engagement. It was bad enough for Joe loving Janey from afar, but having her in his house is pure torture. Will he take advantage of this opportunity to show her what they could have together? And what will Joe’s best friend and Janey’s protective older brother Mac have to say about it?</description>

  <description>Maddie Chester is determined to leave her hometown of Gansett Island, a place that has brought her only bad memories and ugly rumors. Then she’s knocked off her bike on the way to her housekeeping job at McCarthy’s Resort Hotel by Gansett’s “favorite son,” Mac McCarthy. He’s back in town to help his father with preparations to sell the family resort and has no intention of staying long. When Mac accidentally sends Maddie flying over the handlebars, badly injuring her, he moves in to nurse her back to health and help care for her young son. He soon realizes his plans for a hit-and-run visit to the island are in serious jeopardy, and he just may be “maid” for love.</description>

  <description>Former SEAL sniper Cody Roberts has returned from Afghanistan with too many demons and a simple wish: to be left alone. Working for K2 Special Services, caring for the war dogs he rescued, playing his guitar—that’s all he wants to do. But Cody is as protective as his nickname, “Dog,” suggests. A man like that can’t sit back when he realizes the beautiful veterinarian next door is being targeted by an unknown enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley Austin is desperate to find out who’s poisoning her animal patients, and she’s stunned by her mysterious neighbor’s suggestion that it’s personal. But Cody makes her feel something else, too: a powerful attraction. He insists he’s no good for her, but those haunted eyes and that chiseled body tell Riley that surrendering to their mutual lust is worth the risk. And despite his conditions—no falling for each other, no regrets once it’s over—she’ll fight to love him just as fiercely as he’ll fight to save her.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since Ryan O’Connor buried his wife. He was in Afghanistan as a SEAL medic when the call came in that she’d been killed during a robbery. In that time, he returned home, nursed his grief, and joined his former brothers-in-arms in the K2 Special Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After breaking up with her psycho ex, Charlene “Charlie” Morgan finds happiness only when flying the friendly skies—as an acrobatic stunt pilot. But the skies aren’t so friendly when her plane troubles turn out to be the work of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to forget their worries, Charlie and Ryan run into each other at a bar. The chemistry is instant and intense. It’s only supposed to be a one-night stand. But the memory of their passionate kiss lingers, and when Ryan shows up at Charlie’s flight school, their romance takes off. Yet the route to love has its own turbulence—secrets, lies, and danger. Can one night lead to something lasting?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Known to the K2 Special Services team as “Saint,” Jamie Turner lives by his own strict rules to compensate for his past sins and the two-ton boulder taking residence in his heart. He doesn’t drink or smoke. He never swears. And he only dates nice, safe women until he meets Sugar Darling, the fill-in receptionist at K2. She’s as sweet as her name, but this wild woman is definitely trouble, with something to hide. He knows he should avoid her…but can he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugar isn’t hiding something—she’s hiding everything. And K2 seems like the perfect place to lie low, thanks to the big, protective guys who work there. The drop-dead-handsome Saint makes her heart race, yet he keeps his distance. When Sugar’s traumatic past rises up to haunt her again, she desperately turns to Saint for help, and he has to decide what’s more important: playing it safe or risking everything for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Known to the K2 Special Services team as Romeo, ex-Navy SEAL Jake Buchanan may spend his downtime living up to his nickname, but there’s one woman who sets his heart racing like no one else can: Maria Kincaid. Unfortunately, his boss—her brother—has made it crystal clear that she’s off-limits. Jake doesn’t do commitment, while Maria is the type of woman who deserves a promise of forever. Yet Maria finds herself drawn to Jake, the man who stares at her with a desire she wishes he’d act on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still haunted by her horrific childhood, Maria goes searching for the father she’s never met—and stumbles into a nightmarish experience. With her life in grave danger, she reaches out to Jake, her brother’s second-in-command. Jake figures he can help Maria without giving in to temptation. But some things are easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When his best friend and fellow Navy SEAL, Evan Prescott, died in his arms on the battlefield, Logan Kincaid gave his word to watch over Evan’s widow. But for two years he kept his distance…torn between honoring his solemn vow and succumbing to his secret love for his fallen comrade’s wife. But when Dani Prescott desperately reaches out to Logan for the help only he can give, he rushes to her side—determined to fight for her safety as fiercely as he fights against his own buried desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone claiming to be her husband is stalking Dani and her infant daughter, making them virtually prisoners in their remote country home. Logan’s elite military training and high-risk security expertise have outmatched more dangerous enemies. But the real challenge will be the burning temptation that threatens to overcome Logan whenever Dani is near…especially when she reveals her own hidden passion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Staff Sergeant Austin Hall has a brilliant record in the Special Forces—except for one disastrous decision that cost his best friend’s life. Now he’s heading home to Chance Creek, Montana, where he’d like to spend the rest of his days in the obscurity of his family’s ranch. Too bad Great Aunt Heloise won’t hand the ranch over unless all four of the Hall brothers marry and one of them produces an heir within the year. Austin is too broken to marry for love, so he places an online ad for a fake wife. What could possibly go wrong? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella needs to leave Hollywood—fast. It’s bad enough another actress stole her fiancé—on national television. Now she’s ruined her comeback by decking her ex on a morning talk show. Pursued by paparazzi, Ella needs a new life, a new name and someplace to hide. When she reads Austin’s ad for a stand-in wife, she knows she can act this part perfectly. To the rest of the residents of Chance Creek, they’ll be a happily married couple. In private, they’ll just be roommates. In a year when she’d old news and the Hall brothers secure the ranch, she and Austin will quietly divorce and she’ll go on her way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will she? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin’s already finding it hard to remember his promise never to love again. Ella’s finding it hard to keep her hands to herself. But when they’re asked to make a back-up baby, Ella realizes she may have stepped into a lifetime role. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can this pretend marriage go the distance?</description>

  <description>Meg Michaels, a bookstore owner, has already walked away from two cheating exes. She’s learned her lesson and has her mind set on success—until she gets knocked up. Embarrassed and unwilling to discuss her situation with friends and family, she wears layers to hide the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Meg gets sick at a party, she’s mortified. Even worse, Theo Taylor, the guest of honor, discovers her secret. Theo, an Army medic wounded in the war, agrees not to reveal her condition, and the two forge a bond of friendship that blossoms into love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo is soon filling all of Meg’s late-night cravings—and not just the pregnancy-induced ones. But can their love overcome all the obstacles that stand between them and creating a happy family?</description>

  <description>Best friends, big fans, a mysterious webcomic, and a long-lost girl collide in this riveting novel, perfect for fans of both Cory Doctorow and Sarah Dessen; illustrated throughout with comics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, two best friends created a princess together. Libby drew the pictures, May wrote the tales, and their heroine, Princess X, slayed all the dragons and scaled all the mountains their imaginations could conjure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a few years later, Libby was in the car with her mom, driving across the Ballard Bridge on a rainy night. When the car went over the side, Libby passed away, and Princess X died with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once upon a now: May is sixteen and lonely, wandering the streets of Seattle, when she sees a sticker slapped in a corner window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Princess X? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When May looks around, she sees the Princess everywhere: Stickers. Patches. Graffiti. There's an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com. The more May explores the webcomic, the more she sees disturbing similarities between Libby's story and Princess X online. And that means that only one person could have started this phenomenon---her best friend, Libby, who lives.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was AMAZING! I love how it was written with a solid ending. I feel like a lot of YA fiction doesn't commit to the ending because they're hedging bets on being the next big series. IAPX said boom this is the end take it or leave it. I will take it. ]]>

After a heated argument between them turns into a passionate encounter, Deacon realizes Molly is eager to experience more, and she looks to him to take her to the darker edge of lust....&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The last thing either of them expects is how deeply their lives will be thrown upside down by the passion they find together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sizzling continuation of the Mastered series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lorelei James, a man will find the domination he’s always craved…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shiori Hirano and Knox Lofgren are left to run the martial arts program at Black Arts while Ronin Black travels. On the surface, the two highest ranked belts appear to cooperate—but in private, they butt heads constantly, despite the undeniable attraction between them. Soon their power exchanges start to make for a sweltering dynamic in the bedroom…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first Knox is shocked to be living out his submissive desires, but Shiori sets out to prove that embracing his true sexual nature doesn’t make him a weak man. But even while their sexual relationship grants him a power and fulfillment he finds surprising, there’s no training regimen for the fight that comes with loving a strong woman…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34753911-neanderthal-seeks-human" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00BUWA58E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Janie Morris: 1) She is incapable of engaging in a conversation without volunteering TMTI (Too Much Trivial Information), especially when she is unnerved, 2) No one unnerves her more than Quinn Sullivan, and 3) She doesn't know how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her boyfriend, apartment, and job in the same day, Janie Morris can't help wondering what new torment fate has in store. To her utter mortification, Quinn Sullivan- aka Sir McHotpants- witnesses it all then keeps turning up like a pair of shoes you lust after but can't afford. The last thing she expects is for Quinn- the focus of her slightly, albeit harmless, stalkerish tendencies- to make her an offer she can't refuse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If you love Maya Banks and Monica McCarty, don’t miss Sharon Cullen’s captivating Highland Pride novels! &lt;i&gt;Sutherland’s Secret &lt;/i&gt;kicks off a series that’s overflowing with mouthwatering Scottish warriors, captivating history, and forbidden desire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Terror reigns in the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden. As British troops obliterate the last traces of the Jacobite cause, Brice Sutherland, the Earl of Dornach, risks everything to arrange a covert escape route to Canada for his fellow Scots. But when he encounters a dying Englishwoman, hauntingly beautiful though scarred by manacles and unable to speak, Brice’s true courage is put to the test. Nothing but ruin could result from helping her, or worse: falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The pampered daughter of a marquess, Eleanor Hirst was the talk of the London season when she wed the Earl of Glendale. Little did she know that his posting as an officer in Scotland would be their undoing. Now her husband is dead and Eleanor is a fugitive in a hostile country. Desperate for help, she throws herself on the mercy of Brice Sutherland, a handsome Scottish warrior who should be her enemy. Instead, he cares for her tenderly, reviving her shattered spirit—and awakening urges unlike any she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for the novels of Sharon Cullen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “This Regency romance has it all—danger, blackmail, passion, love, and characters that draw you in and leave you wanting more.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Sebastian’s Lady Spy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Heart-wrenching and full of real emotion, proving that love is always the answer, &lt;i&gt;His Saving Grace &lt;/i&gt;is the best book I’ve read this year!”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bronwen Evans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “A sizzling, smart relationship that evolves beautifully to capture readers’ hearts as well as their imaginations.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Pleasing the Pirate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “&lt;i&gt;Loving the Earl&lt;/i&gt; is charming and fast-paced. It’s filled with passion, intrigue, a resourceful heroine you’ll love, and a delicious hero you’ll fall in love with.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jacquie D’Alessandro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “&lt;i&gt;The Notorious Lady Anne&lt;/i&gt; has everything I look for in a romance. Cullen’s debut is a sexy, fun, and thrilling read.”&lt;b&gt;—Bestselling author Shana Galen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One cabin. One bed. And the man of her dreams…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four friends. Four seasons. Four ways to fall in love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Tempting Autumn &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For most of his life, Hitch has put his family’s needs before his own. Finally able to pursue his career as a nature photographer and travel the world, he’s determined to make the most of his freedom. And then he discovers that one of his best friends needs help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fashion designer Rowan thought she’d accepted that marriage and babies would never be a part of her life, but when her muse abandons her she realizes she hasn’t come to terms with it at all. Lonely and miserable, she accepts Hitch’s tempting offer of an autumn adventure in the hope that maybe, in the peace of the mountains, she’ll find the answers she needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A city girl to the core, she’s never been camping in her life, and what seemed like a great idea soon threatens to turn into a disaster. But in spite of the blisters, insects, and geckos, it’s not all bad. It turns out that their friendship is only a thin veneer covering a deep attraction to one another, and in the isolated cabin it’s not long before the cold mountain air turns sizzling hot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The time they spend together suggests that with the right man the future she yearns for is a possibility. Hitch has shown her the path to love, but she discovers she doesn’t want to walk down it with anyone else. The problem is, does Hitch feel the same way? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: this is a forced proximity story. If it makes you nervous to think about being stranded in a secluded mountain hut with a gorgeous guy who’s looking at you the way a tiger looks at his lunch, maybe you should buy another book.</description>

  <description>Four friends. Four seasons. Four ways to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Seducing Summer &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a CEO falls in love with her PA, it can only lead to trouble…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callie Summer, CEO of The Four Seasons lingerie business, is in shock. She’d expected her new PA to be a middle-aged frump, but Jean turns out to be Gene, and he’s neither middle-aged, nor anything like a frump. When the gorgeous Bond-lookalike insists he’ll be the perfect companion on her business trip around the country, Callie agrees to give him a trial. Having recently found her ex in bed with another woman, she’s not looking for love. But a little bit of private lusting never did anyone any harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a military journalist with the New Zealand Army, Gene now runs his own security firm. Hired by Callie’s mother, Phoebe, to secretly protect her daughter after Phoebe receives death threats against her family, Gene finds his work cut out for him. Callie’s as delectable as she is infuriating, and his urge to seduce her fights with his duty to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before they give in to their passion, and the weather isn’t the only thing that turns hot and sultry as they travel further north. But Gene can’t keep his identity a secret from Callie forever. And when an attempt is finally made on her life, the truth threatens to break them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it grows hotter and hotter as they travel north through the country. So does the weather.</description>

  <description>A new standalone romance from NYT bestselling author Tess Oliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ledger&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes one good dose of trouble could turn your life around, put you on the right path. But I'd taken the opposite side of the forked road and headed off looking for even more trouble, like a junkie constantly searching for the next high. Never would I have guessed that turn would lead me to her. &lt;br /&gt;I couldn't stop thinking about her. She was an angel, a hard core, bone-fide angel and in her short life, she'd already had a taste of hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacy&lt;br /&gt;Despair. Heartbreak. Silence. That was all I'd grown to know, until he showed up next door.&lt;br /&gt;The handsome, tattooed stranger had the kind of eyes that were hard to look away from, and he gazed at me as if we'd been friends or even lovers in a different life. He looked at me as if he knew me, and suddenly I had this flash of feeling as if I was right where I was supposed to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I’m a man of few words. The ones I use are violent:&lt;br /&gt;Brawl. Claim. &lt;i&gt;Ravage&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was &lt;b&gt;lust at first sight&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;She looked too damn nice up on that stage to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;A body that curved in all the right places.&lt;br /&gt;Skin demanding that I seize it and squeeze it.&lt;br /&gt;And those eyes…&lt;br /&gt;Eyes I’d never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you have done?&lt;br /&gt;I know what I did: &lt;b&gt;I bought her&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I took her home and let her know who she belonged to now.&lt;br /&gt;She &lt;b&gt;screamed my name&lt;/b&gt; until the rafters shook.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t act like you would have done anything different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should have been the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;But if she was just an expensive lay,&lt;br /&gt;you wouldn’t be reading this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a whole lot more I had yet to find out.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I knew for certain:&lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t had my fill of Michelle.&lt;br /&gt;Not. Even. Close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ravage&lt;/i&gt; is a full-length, standalone romance novel with steamy hot sex, strong language, a happily ever after ending, and NO CLIFFHANGERS. Contains dark and disturbing themes, and over-the-top sexiness that may be uncomfortable for some readers.</description>

  <description>Tanna Barker is a world champion barrel racer. But her personal life has been less of a success, and she’s feeling adrift. After her mother’s unexpected death, her father has remarried, and sold the Texas ranch she called home. Now a rodeo injury has left the restless spitfire holed up in Muddy Gap, unsure what her next move should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she meets her match in a wild, wild cowboy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veterinarian August Fletcher has always put his job first. He’s never found a woman who could handle his on-the-road lifestyle. But when sassy, sexy Tanna blows into town, he finally finds the woman of his fantasies. And there’s something between them, but she claims she’s been burned by love ’em and leave ’em road dogs before. How can Fletch prove that he’s in it for the long haul, and that their sizzling relationship is better than winning any rodeo medal? It’ll take some sweet persuasion to convince Tanna that Muddy Gap is where she belongs.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;FIRST IN A NEW SERIES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the new Mastered series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lorelei James, a woman’s desire to shatter her inhibitions leaves her unprepared for where that erotic journey will take her….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former small-town girl Amery Hardwick is living her dream as a graphic designer in Denver, Colorado. She’s focused on building her business, which leaves little time for dating—not that she needs a romantic entanglement to fulfill her. When her friend signs up for a self-defense class as part of her recovery after an attack, Amery joins her for support. That’s where she meets &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronin Black, owner of the dojo, is so drawn to Amery that he takes over her training—in public and in private. The enigmatic Ronin pushes Amery’s boundaries from the start, and with each new tryst, Amery becomes addicted to the pleasure and to him. But when Amery senses Ronin is hiding something, she questions her total trust in him, despite the undeniable thrill of his possession….</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second in the Mastered series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lorelei James, a man’s need for control is tested by the one woman he’ll risk everything for….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sensei Ronin Black first encounters Amery Hardwick, the fire in her eyes ignites a sexual spark a thousand times better than the primal rush he used to get from mixed martial arts matches. She accepts his darker edges and admits to him that her desires aren’t as wholesome as he believed. And before long Ronin is grappling with emotions he’s never felt before….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet despite demanding Amery bare her body and soul to him, Ronin holds a part of himself back. When she learns Ronin’s secret and walks out, his life begins to unravel.  To regain her trust he must let go of his pride and prove to her that it’s more than passion binding them together. But after their private pleasures are made public, Ronin is unsure if he’s the right man for Amery. Can they face the consequences together? Or will their differences rip them apart?</description>

  <description>The backstory that fans have been clamoring for—how Rock and Trisha fell in love—is the final installment in the Sea Breeze series from New York Times bestselling author Abbi Glines. And don’t miss the sizzling Epilogue, where Abbi wraps up all the Sea Breeze couples’ stories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trisha Corbin always knew how to hide a bruise. With her momma’s boyfriends unable to keep their hands off of her, she had no choice. And as long as it meant the guys wouldn’t go near her little brother, Krit, it was worth it. But her days of dreaming that Prince Charming would ever come rescue her are far, far in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock Taylor always had a plan. Through football, he would rise above the life he was born into. A full ride to play for a major college team was within his reach—assuming he didn’t let anything get in his way. But scoring a date with the hottest girl in Sea Breeze was proving harder than expected. Trisha Corbin was every man’s walking fantasy, and she wouldn’t even glance his way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rock finally does get Trisha in his truck, it isn’t for a date. It’s because he picks her up on the side of the road, beaten and bruised and walking to the local hospital. Before Rock knows it, football is no longer his life. Trisha Corbin is. And he’ll do anything to save her. And keep her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Rock and Trisha’s love story, this special novel contains the wrap-up stories of all your favorite Sea Breeze couples: Sadie and Jax, Marcus and Low, Cage and Eva, Preston and Amanda, Jess and Jason, Krit and Blythe, and Dewayne and Sienna.</description>

  <description>Two men are better than one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can a virgin seeking happily-ever-after with a hot pop star who has a penchant for threesomes win her fantasy man? Kimber Edgington desperately needs a plan to convince Jesse McCall, who’s been her friend and secret crush since they spent a summer together as teenagers, that they are meant for each other. But all the tabloid stories about his sexual escapades make her feel oh-so inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to prove she’s woman enough for Jesse, Kimber turns to bodyguard Deke Trenton for sexual education. Bold and brash, Deke warns Kimber that playing with him is playing with fire. But he can’t bear to imagine the innocent beauty in someone else’s arms. So Deke and his super-sexy friend, Luc, take Kimber under their wings and dangerously close to the edge of ecstasy. Though she’s saved herself for Jesse, Kimber soon learns, he’s not the man adept at stoking her aching, endless need. That’s Deke, and he can’t resist when Kimber begs for more–and more…</description>

  <description>I was warned about Tristan Cole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Stay away from him,” people said.&lt;br /&gt;“He’s cruel.”&lt;br /&gt;“He’s cold.”&lt;br /&gt;“He’s damaged.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to judge a man because of his past. To look at Tristan and see a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I couldn’t do that. I had to accept the wreckage that lived inside of him because it also lived inside of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both empty.&lt;br /&gt;We were both looking for something else. Something more.&lt;br /&gt;We both wanted to put together the shattered pieces of our yesterdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then perhaps we could finally remember how to breathe.</description>

  <description>Just before midnight, on the night of a full moon, a young barber stays out past his bedtime to go to work. Although his customers are mostly regulars, they are anything but normal-after all, even monsters need haircuts. Business is steady all night, and this barber is prepared for anything with his scissors, rotting tonic, horn polish, and stink wax. It's a tough job, but someone's got to help these creatures maintain their ghoulish good looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for Halloween, this is a hilarious story about a boy who follows in his father's footsteps . . . in his own monstrously unique way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can you ever really know if love is true? And if it is, should you stop at anything to get it? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two decades ago, Erin Edwards was sure she’d already found the love of her life: Nate Lawson. Her first love. The one with whom she shared everything--dreams of the future, of children, plans for forever. The one she thought she would spend the rest of her life with. Until one terrible night when Erin made a mistake Nate could not forgive and left her to mourn the relationship she could never forget or get over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Erin is contentedly involved with a phenomenal guy, maneuvering a successful and exciting career, and raising a great daughter all on her own. So why would the name “Nate Lawson” be the first thing to enter her mind when her boyfriend asks her to marry him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of the proposal, Erin finds herself coming unraveled over the past, and the love she never forgot. The more she tries to ignore it and move on, the more it haunts her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Always Something There to Remind Me &lt;/i&gt;is a story that will resonate with any woman who has ever thought of that one first love and wondered, “Where is he?” and “What if…?” Filled with Beth Harbison’s trademark nostalgia humor and heart, it will transport you, and inspire you to believe in the power of first love.</description>

Cold and arrogant. <br /><br />Never leave anything unsaid. Get it all on the table because wondering what if is hell. BUT, know your worth and when to cut people loose.]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Euan McArthur is a chieftain in need of an heir...&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While still a young warrior, Euan incites the fury of a witch. She retaliates with a curse that no wife will ever bear him an heir. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;As he buries his third wife and yet another bonnie stillborn son, Euan can no longer cast her words aside.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morag Farquhar is a woman in need of sanctuary. With a young relative in tow, Morag flees the only home she has ever known to escape her brother, Baron of Wolfsdale, and find sanctuary in the MacArthur stronghold. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pronounced barren by a midwife, Morag is of little value to her family, but a Godsend to Euan, a lover he can’t kill by getting with child.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, chance drew them together, and tangled their lives in ways they could never have imagined. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This time their destiny lies in their own hands, but it will take courage and strong hearts to see it through to the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He’s going in deep to make her his…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling artist Sheridan Harper never imagined she’d spend a sizzling night with Jared Quinn, the smoking-hot star quarterback of her local professional football team, the San Jose Hawks. And she’s even more shocked when Jared’s publicist offers her a proposition: a fake marriage to keep Jared out of the gossip mags. Being that close to Jared would be too tempting, so to protect her heart, she insists on secretly including a clause forbidding sex between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jared just wants to keep his starting QB job and keep it in San Jose. His reputation as a ladies’ man has landed him in the headlines one too many times, but there’s something about his kind, passionate new wife that tempts him beyond reason. Any sort of intimacy between them is completely forbidden, but as their bodies fall in deep, will their hearts follow suit?</description>

  <description>British girl Willow finally has the freedom she's been craving. Now in American on a student visa, the only thing she cares about learning is how to win the heart of Katrina, the university's most unobtainable track star. On the advice of her know-it-all roommate, she learns the only way to get close to Katrina is by gaining access into her very tight group of friends. She quickly learns these women are more than good friends; they are more like family, a type of friendship Willow has never experienced before.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving Katrina is her goal, but Willow finds herself forging true bonds with Katrina's friends as well. Devon is the sweetheart from a political family who holds more than a few secrets of her own. Erica, a soldier recently returned home, is trying to live in a world without her ex-girlfriend, Kai, who is hell bent on winning her back. Larissa is the straight girl who might speak her mind in public, but can't seem to stand up to her overbearing husband and the mother-in-law from hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willow soon learns that this group of friends is a lot more than just people to hang out with. This group is so close that nothing can break them apart. Or can it? When faced with extreme tests that would rock anyone to the core, will this group survive, or will there be some major causalities?</description>

  <description>The First Phone Call from Heaven tells the story of a small town on Lake Michigan that gets worldwide attention when its citizens start receiving phone calls from the afterlife. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father, is determined to find out. An allegory about the power of belief--and a page-turner that will touch your soul--Albom's masterful storytelling has never been so moving and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of The Five People You Meet in Heaven will recognize the warmth and emotion so redolent of Albom's writing, and those who haven't yet enjoyed the power of his storytelling, will thrill at the discovery of one of the best-loved writers of our time.</description>

  <description>My name is Jasmine and I have HIV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was 14 years old the first time my mother’s boyfriend hit me and at the age of 18, I was forced to be a prostitute. Cast away by the same people I thought were family, I was ready to take my own life. Until I met Nate. He didn't run away when I said I was sick. But I wonder why a handsome, funny, Mr. Right like him would love someone like me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Nate and I have a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met Jasmine at a crossroads in my life. She was beautiful, desperate, and inspired me in ways I didn't know were possible. She makes me better in everything and I want to help her get better, too. But I have a secret, one she doesn't have to know - until the time is right.</description>

I will say I wasn't really prepared for the viciousness of some of the first half. I did NOT see that coming. If a story is on a Precious level, that's something you gotta know go...]]>

  <description>Robyn Schneider's &lt;em&gt;The Beginning of Everything&lt;/em&gt; is a witty and heart-wrenching teen novel that will appeal to fans of books by John Green and Ned Vizzini, novels such as &lt;em&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/em&gt;, and classics like &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Varsity tennis captain Ezra Faulkner was supposed to be homecoming king, but that was before—before his girlfriend cheated on him, before a car accident shattered his leg, and before he fell in love with unpredictable new girl Cassidy Thorpe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Revi&lt;/em&gt;ews said in a starred review, "Schneider takes familiar stereotypes and infuses them with plenty of depth. Here are teens who could easily trade barbs and double entendres with the characters that fill John Green's novels."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, smart, and including everything from flash mobs to blanket forts to a poodle who just might be the reincarnation of Jay Gatsby, &lt;em&gt;The Beginning of Everything&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing contemporary twist on the classic coming-of-age novel—a heart-wrenching story about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a typical teen read but it ended unexpectedly. And it really conveyed how everything is connected in some small way and how some things are just truly meant to be even if we don't understand them. I'm glad I read it. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00GQE9CXA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times Bestselling Author Carly Phillips turns up the heat in her newest sexy contemporary romance series, and introduces you to the Dare family… siblings shaped by a father’s secrets and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since finding out his father had another family on the side, Ian Dare swore to be the upstanding, responsible man his cheating parent had never been. When it comes to his relatives, he gives his all but in relationships he offers the bare minimum. But one glimpse of sensual Riley Taylor arouses his dominant and protective instincts and Ian is entranced. He will do anything to possess her … and does. But any future with Riley must include him extending an olive branch to the half-brother who is a constant reminder of the pain he’d rather forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent and always in control, Riley Taylor makes no apologies for choosing men carefully. Relationships have never been a priority and she believes herself hardened to domineering men – until she meets charismatic Ian Dare. He manages to turn a simple kiss into an all out assault on her senses and when he takes control in the bedroom, she’s stunned to discover she likes it. As their affair heats up, they soon realize they complete each other in ways neither imagined. But Riley’s past is closer than she cares to remember, and her struggles with Ian’s dominance might just cost her everything.</description>

  <description>Lizzie Medina went to London to reinvent herself. Tired of being the quiet baby sister, and in no hurry to settle into a boring existence in surburbia, she escapes from home at the first opportunity. When she settles in London for a year of post-graduate studies, Lizzie is sure she’ll be able to start a whole new life. Immerse herself in the books she loves. Explore a new country. Work on her dream of writing a novel. She might even be able to find a little bit of excitement for once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But falling unexpectedly in love with up-and-coming actor Thomas Harper causes Lizzie to re-think… everything. Just as she’s convinced herself this small-town girl from the Midwest can handle this great adventure, Thomas’s career suddenly explodes to superstar levels, and Lizzie finds herself forced to navigate the fame game of red carpets, catty co-stars, gossip magazines, and paparazzi. When she wished for a new life, she had no idea it would be anything like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lizzie must now determine if her love—and her confidence—are strong enough to get her through the complications of dating a movie star. Even if she and Thomas are able to pull through before she has to leave London, how will she deal with the inevitability of returning to a life at home that no longer feels like her own? Will she follow her family’s wishes or follow her heart? Will the Lizzie she discovered in London be strong enough to help her pursue her dreams?</description>

      <![CDATA[This story really resonated with me. It wasn't the most believable set up ever but it was very sweet and I think the author handled Lizzy's struggle really well. It can be so scary and nerve wracking to find your own way in the world vs what your parents and family want for you.]]>

He has tenure. He hates computers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The dean hates him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watch as Arthur and the dean engage in a angst filled battle to end (or save) his job. If you like social media, blogging, and mockery, you’ll enjoy Underwood, Scotch, and Wry. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After years of dreaming, Jessica is finally getting married, but the marriage isn't exactly what she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel is her best friend, and she's known him all her life, but he's never gotten over losing his wife two years ago. His dream is to become the pastor of the church in their hometown, but the small-town congregation keeps balking over calling an unmarried minister. Since Daniel needs a wife and Jessica wants a husband and family, she proposes an arrangement that benefits both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can get married. They can build a life together. They can celebrate Christmas as a couple. It's fine that he doesn't love her. And it's fine that she's not exactly suited to be a small-town pastor's wife. And it's fine that she's more attracted to her sexy, brooding husband every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica can be practical about this marriage. She knows what she's getting into, after all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book includes fully-developed sex scenes between a husband and wife.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;"It’s my last night in town, and I’m not flying home until this girl is flat on her back with her ankles up around her shoulders and I'm so deep inside her she'll never want another man again."&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot, English businessman &lt;b&gt;Ashton Pierce&lt;/b&gt; made a pact not to screw up his friendship with &lt;b&gt;Justine ‘JJ’ Jenkins&lt;/b&gt; over a cheap one-night stand. Now, two years later, he’s going out of his mind with wanting her -- but she’s still off-limits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now school is over, and his control is wearing thin. They've got one last night together, and he’s determined to make it an experience she’ll never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one girl he swore off is going to have the night of her life. And with a sexy game of dare on the table, it won’t take long...</description>

  <description>Juicy Robinson was the color of sweet black licorice, of a charcoal briquette soaked in lighter fluid and no one was going to make her feel like she wasn't the sexiest thing around-not the white people that her mother had taught her to distrust and certainly not the homeless white man that has been watching her from the alley. This interracial love journey is the tale of Juicy who has spent much of her adolescence being bullied because of her dark skin and her weight, until circumstances forced her to stand up for herself. And Troy, whose mental illness forced him into the streets. Now, as an adult, Juicy has grown into a woman that is filled with anger and a distrust of whites instilled in her by her mother. After an altercation, Juicy finds herself rescued by an unlikely individual; a white, homeless man that she has thoughtlessly nick-named; 'Mr. Cracker.' After exploring mutual stereotypes and attempting to understand their differences, Juicy and Troy find themselves drawn to each other. Out of a sense of loneliness and true friendship the two outcasts finally find something deeper than friendship and their journey to self discovery begins.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Ever,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These letters are often all that get me through week to week. Even if it’s just random stuff, nothing important, they’re important to me. Gramps is great, and I love working on the ranch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But…I’m lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel disconnected, like I’m no one, like I don’t belong anywhere. Like I’m just here until something else happens. I don’t even know what I want with my future. But your letters, they make me feel connected to something, to someone. I had a crush on you, when we first met. I thought you were beautiful. So beautiful. It was hard to think of anything else. Then camp ended and we never got together, and now all I have of you is these letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S**t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just told you I have a crush on you. HAD. Had a crush. Not sure what is anymore. A letter-crush? A literary love? That’s stupid. Sorry. I just have this rule with myself that I never throw away what I write and I always send it, so hopefully this doesn’t weird you out too much. I had a dream about you too. Same kind of thing. Us, in the darkness, together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was like you said, a memory turned into a dream, but a memory of something that’s never happened, but in the dream it felt so real, and it was more, I don’t even know, more RIGHT than anything I’ve ever felt, in life or in dreams. I wonder what it means that we both had the same dream about each other. Maybe nothing, maybe everything. You tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re pen pals. Maybe that’s all we’ll ever be. I don’t know. If we met IRL (in real life, in case you’re not familiar with the term) what would happen? And just FYI, the term you used, a literary love? It was beautiful. So beautiful. That term means something, between us now. We are literary loves. Lovers? I do love you, in some strange way. Knowing about you, in these letters, knowing your hurt and your joys, it means something so important to me, that I just can’t describe. I need your art, and your letters, and your literary love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we never have anything else between us, I need this. I do. Maybe this letter will only complicate things, but like you I have a rule that I never erase or throw away what I’ve written and I always send it, no matter what I write in the letter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your literary love,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Veronica Cruz has been through hell and back. After disconnecting with the world two years ago to be at the side of her dying mother, she’s left alone, unemployed, overweight, and feeling a decade older than her twenty-eight years. When her best friend coaxes her into joining the local gym to ditch her depression and rejuvenate her life, she meets Noah. Assigned to help Veronica lose weight, Noah is everything she expected a young trainer to be—perfectly chiseled, supportive and motivating. Add to that, he’s incredibly sexy. He’s everything she’s ever looked for in a man. What she least expected was for him to fall for her, but he has. There's just one glaring problem: Noah is eight years younger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Quintanilla has his eye on a boxing title—someday. Down for a few months with an injury, his maintenance-boy pay at 5th Street Gym won't cut it. He’s finally given the opportunity to train. The catch? His trainee is an out-of-shape woman with a free week pass. Taking on the challenge, Noah stumbles into one of the closest friendships he’s ever known, and before he knows it, he’s in love. But Veronica’s not having it—the age difference is too much. Their platonic relationship means having to watch her date other men—something that would make him crazy. Believing he's the man for her, Noah sets out to prove that age is but an illusion, and there's more to him than just a number.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What’s a single mother do when she’s run out of options?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her father kicked her off the family farm because she was pregnant, seventeen-year-old Libby Bateson swore she’d never go back. She and her daughter, Nicole, have scraped by in the city for the past eight years, but when Libby finds out Nicole is being bullied and under-performing at school, she decides it’s time to swallow her pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going home isn't easy. Libby finds the farmhouse neglected and filthy. Her father is a cantankerous hermit who won’t speak to her. Even Gibson Browning, the farmer next door whom she’d once had a crush on, is making her life complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson’s wife died two years ago and now he’s a single parent too - raising a daughter the same age as Nicole. The hard working, good looking Gibson is a loyal friend and a loving father. Libby knows she could easily fall for him - which would be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Libby can’t stay in Chatsworth for long. Not without risking exposure of the secret that could ruin her daughter’s life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Caleb Barnes is on a mission. He's retired from the Army, but he's waging his own private war now. And though the men of Burnout are his former brothers-in-arms, Caleb fights his battles alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb was tainted from the moment he was born. He's always been alone and he'll always be alone. The world has no place for a man like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabelle Boucher is on a mission of her own. She doesn't want to go it alone, but there's no other choice these days. She won't give up or give in, not until she reaches the end of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb's convinced he's no good for anyone, especially not women. There's nothing he can offer a woman but pain and devastation. But Isabelle needs help and to refuse goes against everything Caleb stands for. Can two people alone for different reasons come together for a common cause? And once they do, will they ever want to be apart again?</description>

  <description>John Palmer hasn't felt like a real man since he was injured during combat in Iraq. Though not content with his new life, he is mostly adapting, just like the other vets at the Lost ‘N’ Found Investigative Service. When Shannon Murphy is hired on as the new office manager, life suddenly gets a lot more interesting. Before long, John finds himself wondering if he could ever be the kind of man Shannon needs.&lt;p&gt;Shannon Murphy wasn't really looking for love when she hired on at LNF, but finds herself hopelessly attracted to the sex-on-wheels former Marine, John Palmer. The man is grumpy and nearly impossible to work with, but his brand of masculinity appeals to her on a basic level. Soon Shannon is wondering just what it would take for John to want her the way she wants him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an old enemy tries to settle a vendetta against Shannon, John insists on protecting her. He moves into her house, fanning the spark of attraction into a blaze. But the danger continues to escalate. Will the connection that they've found survive when they’re thrust into a fight for their lives?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jimmy “Easy” Turnbull lost more than just his lower right leg during his time in Iraq. The confident man whose good looks charmed countless women into bed has been gone for over three years. In his place is a surly and defensive wounded warrior plagued by self-doubt and anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Cutter doesn’t give a damn what people think, not about her tattoos, her piercings or anything else. Other people’s opinions have never bothered her, not even the hot ex-Army Ranger who occasionally takes her to bed (when they make it that far) but can’t seem to remember her name afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy wants a new life, and she’s determined to get it. Easy wants his old life back, but he knows that can’t happen now. Eventually Daisy’s past catches up to her and her dreams of making a home in Rapid City are threatened. Easy must decide what his new future will look like, and whether not there’s room for a sassy blonde who pushes all his buttons.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alternate/Updated cover for ASIN: B00J55MAYA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawk Red Cloud lives by his own set of rules: Don't let them share the saddle, don't bring them home, and never spend the night. So far, he's managed to avoid commitment like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tildy Fletcher's parents set rules for her. She would never think of breaking them; she knows all too well what would happen if she did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawk and Tildy are from two different worlds, but there's no denying the attraction between them. The rules are designed to keep them apart. Will they be willing to break them for a chance at true love?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18755122-tex" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00GGL8UWM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING -This book contains BDSM- WARNING &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby Raines is leaving Las Vegas. She’s trading the glitter and excess of her hometown for the rolling hills and lush forests of Rapid City, South Dakota. She’s taken her first real job and she’s determined to succeed on her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Marsten traded the Texas range for the Army Rangers years ago and never looked back. Now, he’s settled permanently in Rapid City with the remaining members of his Special Forces unit. He thought he had it all, well almost anyway. Until a sassy redhead with a sharp tongue and body to die for rolled into town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark knows he’s too much for her long-term, but he can’t resist a fling with Rapid City’s newest resident. He thought he knew the game. After all, it’s his game. And always his rules. But more and more it feels like Abby is the one holding all the cards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnout is a series but each novel can stand alone on its own. You do not have to read Tex to enjoy the others. It is the only novel in the series with BDSM. If you don’t like BDSM skip this one. Fair warning: the kink factor is extremely high.</description>

He only wants to focus on holding what’s left of his old unit together, running his garage where he builds custom bikes and cars, and pretending that his murdered father’s motorcycle gang doesn’t exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayley Turner is a young woman with her own traumatic past. Fresh off the bus from Nowhere, USA, all she wants is a job and a place to live, until it’s time for her to leave again. She doesn’t want to make friends, or enemies, least of all the ex-Army Ranger who obviously doesn’t like her. She bristles under his watchful eye. He’s even got her convinced she’s bad news. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But circumstances force two people who don’t need anyone to need each other more and more. The more Chris gets to know Hayley, the harder it is to stay detached. And the more Hayley gets to know Chris, the more she realizes she’s been alone for so long she might never recover from it.</description>

  <description>Over 500,000 copies sold worldwide, over 800 Reviews. Now translated in German French&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you tell a man there is something wrong with his child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Nelson, ends a loveless, bitter marriage and strikes out on her own. She answers an ad as a cook and live-in caregiver to a three-year-old boy on a local ranch. Ranch owner Brad Friessen hires and moves in Emily and her daughter. But Emily soon discovers something's seriously wrong with the boy, and the reclusive, difficult man who hired her can't see the behavior and how delayed his son is. Emily researches until she stumbles across what she suspects are the soft signs of autism. Now she must tell him, give him hope, and help him come to terms with this neurological disorder--to take the necessary steps to get his child the help he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their lives become intertwined, their attraction is unavoidable--a connection sparks between them. But just as they're getting close, Brad's estranged wife, Crystal, returns after abandoning the family two years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal must've had a plan, as she somehow gains the upper hand, driving a wedge in the emotional bond forged between Brad, Emily, and the children. The lengths to which Crystal will go, the lies, the greed, just to keep what's hers, are nothing short of cold and calculating. Brad fights to save his boy, to protect what's his, and struggles over his greatest sacrifice—Emily, and the haunting question: Has he lost her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is by far one of the best books I have read. Lorhainne Eckhart proved herself yet again by pulling you in with a heartfelt story and keeping your attention with the passion that fills the pages.” — ROMANCE JUNKIES &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A Real Tear Jerker: Omg, I loved this book. I stayed up all night trying to finish it. I cried, My heart broke, I have an 18 year old with autism. This would make a fabulous movie.”Reviewer – Tammy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Brilliant, there is no other word for it, heart grabbing, heart warming, gut wrenching, well written well researched, wanted to read it over over again." Maureen &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BLACK RAVEN'S REVIEWS — “Ms. Eckhart has crafted a delightful story with engaging characters, enough drama for a Hallmark movie, and enough unconditional love to last a lifetime.”—Rated 5 Ravens and a Recommended Read by AJ!— &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Shelly Gelson had it all...a job teaching English at Carver High, her best friend Mel working by her side and she's engaged to her high school sweetheart Chase Marino. That is until Chase breaks her heart and leaves her for another teacher at the school. Now Shel is left broken-hearted and trying to figure out what she wants while watching Chase and the home wrecker make moon eyes at each other. Enter Matt Fuller, Shel's friend for the past 5 years and the perfect rebound. He's gorgeous, smart, funny and fits into Shel's idea of the right guy. Only problem is there may be more there than just a simple rebound. Is it a way to fill a void left by Chase, or is there more smoldering between these two friends? Find out what happens when the bell rings and the teenage drama ends and the adult drama begins. Who says being a teacher is boring? They obviously haven't met the teachers at Carver High.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this book contains the following adult content.&lt;br /&gt;Sex and nudity: Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Profanity: Hell yes!&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol: That too!</description>

  <description>INDEPENDENT PUBLISHER BOOK AWARDS GOLD MEDAL AS FEATURED ON MARIASHRIVA.COM An Absent Mind, a riveting new novel from Eric Rill, author of Pinnacle of Deceit and The Innocent Traitor, is about a race against time. The ticking time bomb is Saul Reimer's sanity. His Alzheimer's is going to be the catalyst that will either bring his family together or tear it apart. Although An Absent Mind depicts Saul's arduous struggle with Alzheimer's, it is equally a story about his relationship with his loved ones and their shared journey. Seventy-one, and a man used to controlling those around him, Saul finds himself helplessly slipping into the abyss in what he describes as his slow dance with death. As we listen in on his ramblings, humor, emotions, lucid moments, and confusion, we are also privy to the thoughts and feelings his family share with us-his wife, Monique, conflicted and depressed; caring, yet angry; his daughter, Florence, compassionate, worried about her father's health, yet proper and reserved; his son, Joey, self-centered and narcissistic, seemingly distant from his family's challenges. And Dr. Tremblay, Saul's Alzheimer's specialist, who provides the reader with facts and observations about this dreaded disease that imprisons more than 35 million people worldwide. We know from the beginning how it has to end for Saul, because no one has ever outsmarted Alzheimer's. But how will he navigate the meandering road that will eventually destroy his health and result in his death? And how will it affect those around him as they live with strain and guilt, while at the same time being forced to face their own demons? These questions are answered expertly by the author as he explores the conflicts that rise to the surface as the family deals with Saul's dementia. Eric Rill's novel is reminiscent of Lisa Genova's Still Alice, Nicholas Sparks" The Notebook, and Alice Munro's Away From Her. Although a beautiful work of literary fiction, An Absent Mind will expose the reader to the reality of Alzheimer's.</description>

  <description>In this utterly charming debut — one woman sets out to complete her old list of childhood goals, and finds that her lifelong dreams lead her down a path she never expects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. Go to Paris&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;2. Perform live, on a super big stage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;3. Have a baby, maybe two&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;4. Fall in love&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett Bohlinger has forgotten all about the list of life goals she’d written as a naïve teenager. In fact, at thirty-four, Brett seems to have it all—a plum job at her family’s multimillion-dollar company and a spacious loft with her irresistibly handsome boyfriend. But when her beloved mother, Elizabeth, dies, Brett’s world is turned upside down. Rather than simply naming her daughter the new CEO of Bohlinger Cosmetics, Elizabeth’s will comes with one big stipulation: Brett must fulfill the list of childhood dreams she made so long ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken, Brett can barely make sense of her mother’s decision. Some of her old hopes seem impossible. How can she possibly have a relationship with a father who died seven years ago? Other dreams (Be an awesome teacher!) would require her to reinvent her entire future. For each goal attempted, her mother has left behind a bittersweet letter, offering words of wisdom, warmth, and—just when Brett needs it—tough love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Brett struggles to complete her abandoned life list, one thing becomes clear: Sometimes life’s sweetest gifts can be found in the most unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Robin used to be the dependable friend and good girl, until Jason and his friends abused her trust. Now the once shy girl lives on the opposite end of the spectrum. Sordid nights filled with drug use and alcohol finds Robin now spiraling out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Jason will stop at nothing to gain her trust and love, and hopefully to save her from herself. In book 3 of this award nominated story, the tale of the Wheels of Steel gang continues with a new epilogue and ending never before seen in print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three part interracial love story explores the spirit of love and acceptance between a person with an obvious disability—and someone whose disabilities are not always quite so obvious. This story contains graphic sex, language and drug use and is intended for mature readers only.</description>

  <description>Jason, better known as Top, is an up and coming DJ. He’s a white guy that knows more about Hip Hop than most and he also has cerebral palsy. His group Wheels of Steel is comprised of self-proclaimed misfits that are made cool by their talent. But despite his talent and popularity, Jason is plagued by issues of trust and anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin is a shy black girl that takes a job as his home healthcare aid. Her crippling nervous condition makes everything difficult for her, not just her bad tempered client with cerebral palsy, but also his close knit friends, and even her mother with her best intentions. Their saga takes them along a musical journey of self-discovery and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three part interracial love story explores the spirit of love and acceptance between a person with an obvious disability—and someone whose disabilities are not always quite so obvious.</description>

  <description>A debut unlike any other, &lt;i&gt;Shine, Shine, Shine&lt;/i&gt; is a shocking, searing, breathless love story, a gripping portrait of modern family, and a stunning exploration of love, death and what it means to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunny Mann has masterminded a life for herself and her family in a quiet Virginia town. Her house and her friends are picture-perfect. Even her genius husband, Maxon, has been trained to pass for normal. But when a fender bender on an average day sends her coiffed blonde wig sailing out the window, her secret is exposed. Not only is she bald, Sunny is nothing like the Stepford wife she’s trying to be. As her facade begins to unravel, we discover the singular world of Sunny, an everywoman searching for the perfect life, and Maxon, an astronaut on his way to colonize the moon. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Theirs is a wondrous, strange relationship formed of dark secrets, decades-old murders and the urgent desire for connection. As children, the bald, temperamental Sunny and the neglected savant Maxon found an unlikely friendship no one else could understand. She taught him to feel -- helped him translate his intelligence for numbers into a language of emotion. He saw her spirit where others saw only a freak. As they grew into adults, their profound understanding blossomed into love and marriage. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But with motherhood comes a craving for normalcy that begins to strangle Sunny’s marriage and family. As Sunny and Maxon are on the brink of destruction, at each other’s throats with blame and fear of how they’ve lost their way, Maxon departs for the moon, where he’s charged with programming the robots that will build the fledgling colony. Just as the car accident jars Sunny out of her wig and into an awareness of what she really needs, an accident involving Maxon’s rocket threatens everything they’ve built, revealing the things they’ve kept hidden. And nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>Imaginary friend Budo narrates this heartwarming story of love, loyalty, and the power of the imagination—the perfect read for anyone who has ever had a friend . . . real or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Budo is lucky as imaginary friends go. He's been alive for more than five years, which is positively ancient in the world of imaginary friends. But Budo feels his age, and thinks constantly of the day when eight-year-old Max Delaney will stop believing in him. When that happens, Budo will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max is different from other children. Some people say that he has Asperger's Syndrome, but most just say he's "on the spectrum." None of this matters to Budo, who loves Max and is charged with protecting him from the class bully, from awkward situations in the cafeteria, and even in the bathroom stalls. But he can't protect Max from Mrs. Patterson, the woman who works with Max in the Learning Center and who believes that she alone is qualified to care for this young boy.</description>

Then, she meets Avery...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery Martin is a simple man, a country boy at heart who is working at his dream job as a fireman. When he responds to a nasty car accident, he is immediately taken with the petite blonde he finds pinned in the wreckage. Crossing professional lines, he strikes up a friendship with her. But can they settle for friendship when their forever is staring them in the face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will an ex with a vendetta drive them apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Contains: Adult Content and Some Explicit Scenes</description>

But even the barre can’t steady her when fate brings her face-to-face with her old college flame, Mason, who’s hoping to return to the NFL after a career-threatening injury. Before they can surrender to their sexual desires and find salvation in each other’s arms, they need to come to terms with their past. Mason must confront the demons that have set him on a path of self-destruction, while Emory must decide whether to keep her painful secrets locked away, or expose them and risk losing the love of her life. But nothing can prepare Mason for what Emory has kept hidden, or the possibility that he himself may be to blame for the very secrets she keeps – and why they continue to haunt her.</description>

  <description>Meredith Schorr’s second novel proves that chick lit, beyond just entertaining the reader, can also empower and inspire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Frank is ready to fall in love or so she thinks. It’s been a year since her long-term relationship with Bob (who was not the one) ended and she is ready for some passion. With the LSAT coming up and her goals to ace law school and become a partner in her father’s prestigious law firm penciled in her life plan, the only missing piece is the love of her life. The hunt is on, but there is just one problem: All the guys in New York City are flakes. Interested one day and gone the next – dropping off the face of the earth with no warning and no explanation. Initially a firm believer that love will conquer all, Jane becomes jaded and cynical, debating whether to join her best friend Marissa in singlehood, making cupcakes and watching True Blood or follow the advice of her co-worker Andrew and turn the game back on those who scorned her. As Jane attempts to juggle her own responsibilities and put up with the colorful problems of everyone around her, she realizes that having it all isn’t all that easy, and even the best laid plans sometimes require revisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you’ve read all that chick lit has to offer, think again as A State of Jane concludes with a curve-ball you don’t see coming.</description>

  <description>As the daughter of the town slut, she clawed her way up from the bars of Bourbon Street to the Country Music Hall of Fame. She’s America’s sweetheart, darling of the media, and a multi-platinum star. But she has a secret. At the age of sixteen, she had a baby and gave him up for adoption because her boyfriend wasn't ready for fatherhood. Now she finds out that her precious baby boy has been living with his father from day one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe Swanson is a Texas cattle baron riches-to-rags story. As the only son of the town's most prominent family, it was a huge blow when his father lost the family fortune in a ponzi scheme. Now, Gabe is land rich and cash poor. But he has his son and family is all that matters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Betts moves back to the small town that shunned her, all hell breaks loose. She wants her son. Can Betts and Gabe leave their past in the rear view mirror so they can be a family?</description>

  <description>Happily-ever-after isn't only for the rich and beautiful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her long-term fiancé dumps her, 34-year-old Lucy Hathcoat is determined to replace him as efficiently as possible. Her best friend the supermodel is getting married to a billionaire -- what better place than their week-long wedding in a luxury eco-resort to find a new man? Lucy isn't picky; she just wants a decent guy who's eager to start a family. Someone as logical, responsible, and practical as she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the six-foot-five, fun-loving Miles Girard. Being totally hot and charming is not important. She doesn't need a man who makes her laugh. A man who makes her jump in his lap and kiss him. A man who is pathologically wary of marriage and thinks she needs him more than she needs a husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, Lucy's starting to feel like maybe, just maybe, she can't live without him . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The sequel to this book is &lt;i&gt;Diving In.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Broken Heart is the city with the highest rate of divorce and highest percentage of single parents in Oklahoma. And I, Jessica Matthews, have been a member of that club ever since my husband dumped me for his twentysomething secretary and then had the gall to die in a car accident. Now I’m not just a single mother trying to make ends meet in this crazy world....I’m also a vampire. One minute I was taking out the garbage; the next I awoke sucking on the thigh of superhot vampire Patrick O’Halloran, who’d generously offered his femoral artery to save me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But though my stretch marks have disappeared and my vision has improved, I can’t rest until the thing that did this to me is caught. My kids’ future is at stake…figuratively and literally. As is my sex life. Although I wouldn’t mind finding myself attached to Patrick’s juicy thigh again, I learned that once a vampire does the dirty deed, it hitches her to the object of her affection for at least one hundred years. I just don’t know if I’m ready for that kind of commitment....&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jasmine Freeman’s world is about to tumble down around her and the one responsible for it is none other than her first love, Derek Titan. She hasn't seen him in ten years, and they are both going to learn the truth of what happened back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine grew up wealthy and oblivious to the destruction her father caused all around him. Derek was from the wrong side of the tracks. In ten years their lives will be reversed. He is now a multi-billionaire tycoon and she works hard, but barely gets by due to her father’s unethical business practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek comes seeking revenge and instead finds out he has a half grown son and the woman he's been angry with for so many years is not who he thought she was. They both fight against the passion they still feel for each other, but in the end it is irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come take the journey with Derek and Jasmine as they rediscover a passion that never died and the lies that kept them apart.</description>

  <description>New York telecommunications expert Jessica Bloom has never quite gotten things right. She's failed at relationships, and only believes herself to have moved ahead at work due to dumb luck. Her fortunes change when she flies to Madrid on an acquisitions deal -- but wakes up married to a matador instead! While she's held a burning attraction to her handsome business adversary for months, she never dreamed she'd make such an enormous split-second decision. Surely, this is a mistake they can both get undone? Her new husband, however, has plans to the contrary...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fernando Garcia de la Vega runs a telecommunications firm poised for a US takeover. What Fernando doesn't expect, is its beautiful International Division head also capturing his heart. Descended from a long line of bullfighters, Fernando stands to inherit the family's lucrative estate, if he meets the criteria in his grandfather's will and marries by age thirty-two. Yet, a marriage of convenience was something Fernando was loathe to consider... until now. When the fates conspire to put the right woman in the right place -- at the right time, how can Fernando deny his destiny? His only problem lies in convincing Jessica to remain his bride.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Cover Edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11881750-friends-with-partial-benefits" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B0057XY24K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian Grayson is a disillusioned divorcée and best-selling romance novelist who can’t write a chapter without her hunky male heartthrob suffering ED, an STD, or even worse. Brian Nash is a tennis-obsessed, college senior who’s unlucky in love and the roommate and best friend of Jillian’s son, Rob. When Rob brings Brian home for spring break and he meets the surprisingly young and also tennis passionate Jillian, their shared interest quickly develops into an intense mutual attraction. After nearly giving in to their feelings, they hatch a plan, while under the influence (of something more than just the perfect Miami night), to be Friends With Partial Benefits complete with rules to define the boundaries. Will the lonely pair continue with this distinctive relationship, actually explore their desires or will they discover all of it is a really bad idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with passion, longing, surprises and humor, the first book in Friends With… Series is hard to put down and will leave you laughing out loud and slightly sleep deprived.</description>

At the end of the book it is revealed that the author has actually written two versions of this series and this version is the tamer version. So it seems like some of the awkwardness might be an editing issue. Veronica...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Cover Edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29698573-a-different-blue" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Echohawk doesn't know who she is. She doesn't know her real name or when she was born. Abandoned at two and raised by a drifter, she didn't attend school until she was ten years old. At nineteen, when most kids her age are attending college or moving on with life, she is just a senior in high school. With no mother, no father, no faith, and no future, Blue Echohawk is a difficult student, to say the least. Tough, hard and overtly sexy, she is the complete opposite of the young British teacher who decides he is up for the challenge, and takes the troublemaker under his wing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a nobody who becomes somebody. It is the story of an unlikely friendship, where hope fosters healing and redemption becomes love. But falling in love can be hard when you don't know who you are. Falling in love with someone who knows exactly who they are and exactly why they can't love you back might be impossible.</description>

  <description>There were never such devoted sisters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. David Lambert and his wife, Brianna, received the ultimate gift from her fraternal twin. They gratefully accepted it, of course, because everyone knows you can't return a baby like an itchy sweater. Yet, that's essentially what Brianna does when she has a meltdown and unexpectedly divorces David. She runs from their home in Redemption, Pennsylvania, and leaves their surrogate--her sister, Casey--pregnant with his little bundle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When David chose her beautiful twin over her, Casey McIntyre hid her hurt behind a wall of sarcasm. Now that her sister has divorced her husband, it's increasingly difficult to remember why the hunky pediatrician is supposed to be off limits--especially since Brianna doesn't seem to want him or care if Casey and he get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David always liked and admired his selfless ex-sister-in-law--despite that the sassy preschool teacher is always busting his chops. Consequently, after his wife bails on marriage and motherhood, it's only natural he turns to Casey for sympathy. Unfortunately, the exasperating pixie becomes more irresistible with each day she carries his child. He already mistook lust for love once and jumped way too fast into marriage. He's not about to botch up his life that way again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey wants whatever happiness she can grab, whether it's temporary or not. The only problem is, if she lets herself love her baby (or David), what will happen to her when her sister inevitably realizes her mistake and returns to Redemption?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Trouble In Paradise. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Katie Long was supposed to be undercover. She was just supposed to watch Deputy Prosecutor Eric Kimura at his ex's wedding and gather intel on his campaign for prosecutor. But he's a lot hotter in person, and the kind of intel they accidentally shared in the hotel bathroom might lose both of them their jobs. Especially since it seems to be a recurring incident. Is it possible for a one-night stand to last ten days? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kimura isn't usually the impulsive type. He's driven, he's ambitious, and he knows what he wants--a respectable future in Hawaii politics. Which means wild half-public sex with a beautiful stranger in a short little caterer's skirt is just tabloid fodder waiting to happen. Conveniently, just as his campaign is coming under attack. Sabotage, media gossip, and an insatiable desire for a woman he just met? If he's not careful, Counselor Kimura might lose all control. . .</description>

  <description>“Sandra Hill writes stories that tickle the funnybone and touch the heart.”&lt;br /&gt;—Susan Wiggs, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh those Vikings! Fans of Sandra Hill adore the sexy Norse studs the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author so masterfully brings to life in her brazenly original, outrageously funny, and scorching hot love stories. In &lt;em&gt;Truly, Madly Viking&lt;/em&gt;, the phenomenal Hill transports her muscle-bound Scandinavian warrior hero magically across centuries and lands him in a modern-day mental hospital—where one lucky female psychologist who gets to “treat” the gorgeous Norseman she calls “Joe.” This is &lt;em&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest&lt;/em&gt; Sandra Hill-style—a gift of love and laughter from the author who superstar Christine Feehan says, “always delivers smart, sexy, laugh-out-loud action.”&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Collin Masters was used to being in control--of his company, his love life and especially his emotions. But the unexpected arrival of his three-year-old twin nieces threatened to make the fast-moving ad exec come unglued. Sabrina Sinclair was the only person who could bail him out of this mess. Unfortunately, she'd quit working for him just weeks earlier, and he was pretty sure she hated him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Collin was masterful at getting his way. Before you could say "daddy," his former assistant was his nanny, living under his roof. Sabrina's room was just steps from Collin's bedroom--suddenly a little too close for comfort. Playing house with Sabrina was about to get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; out of hand....</description>

  <description>THE SECRETS OF the past meet the shocks of the present.&lt;br /&gt;Aslaug is an unusual young woman. Her mother has brought her up in near isolation, teaching her about plants and nature and language—but not about life. Especially not how she came to have her own life, and who her father might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Aslaug’s mother dies unexpectedly, everything changes. For Aslaug is a suspect in her mother’s death. And the more her story unravels, the more questions unfold. About the nature of Aslaug’s birth. About what she should do next. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About whether divine miracles have truly happened. And whether, when all other explanations are impossible, they might still happen this very day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addictive, thought-provoking, and shocking, &lt;i&gt;Madapple &lt;/i&gt;is a page-turning exploration of human nature and divine intervention—and of the darkest corners of the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>"There are so many memorable moments in this book that I could spend page after page quoting them." —USA TODAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Poor Johnny Smith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At age 33, the house painter has been a best man a whopping eight times, when all he's ever really wanted is to be a groom. But despite being everyone’s favorite dude, Johnny has yet to find The One. Or even anyone. So when he meets high-powered District Attorney Helen Troy, and falls for her hard, he follows the advice of family and friends. Since Helen seems to hate sports, Johnny pretends he does too. No more Jets. No more Mets. At least not in public. He redecorates his condo. He gets a cat. He takes up watching soap operas. Anything he thinks will earn him Helen, Johnny is willing to do. There's just one hitch: If he does finally win her heart, who will he be? </description>

  <description>IN TOO DEEP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mattie O’Neal is on the run. She's chopped off her hair, stolen a car, changed her name, and is hiding in a tiny Arizona town, slinging hash. She thought she was safe – until Zeke Shephard walked through the door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rugged, hard-edged Zeke doesn't get involved--but there's something about Mattie's courage that catches his sympathy. When the thugs who want to silence Mattie forever show up, Zeke steps in and takes her to his own private hide away, where the two must decide if the link between them is worth fighting for...and if they can stay alive long enough to explore it.</description>

  <description>Joseph Anderson has decided it is time his three successful sons find brides. Joseph wants grandchildren to fill his huge mansion, and he wants them immediately.&lt;p&gt;His eldest son Lucas is successful in all areas of his life except love. He has no desire to have any woman enter that life, causing chaos, or using his family's name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Harper was raised in tragic circumstances and does not like pampered, rich men who have been handed everything with a silver spoon. She spent years finishing her education and was blessed to get a job with the famous Andersons Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy and Lucas will fight their attraction to each other, but find that they cannot resist the sparks that fly. They take a journey together learning to challenge, trust and ultimately...Love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jess Harper’s personal life is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn’t had a haircut since 2006 and she doesn’t have time to find better friends than the self-centred associates she’s had since University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And instead of searching for love, she’s settled for ‘friends with benefits’ status with one of her buddies. Yet none of that matters, because professionally she’s living the dream, and has just scored a highly coveted assignment in Japan with the promise of a promotion on her return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she arrives in Japan, instead of the smooth integration she anticipated, Jess finds herself wrongfully fired, abandoned and broke in a country where she doesn’t speak the language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she must rebuild her life and clear her name. But the friendly locals and allure of the ex-pat lifestyle soon have her reconsidering her priorities and challenging her views on climbing the corporate ladder. With a new job as an English teacher and the temptation of her cute (but already attached) roommate, Jess discovers that although life doesn't always turn out as planned, maybe that's not such a bad thing.</description>

  <description>INDECENT PROPOSAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago Ann Talbot had been forced to leave Heath Bodine without a goodbye. Now she was back, and though Heath still had the power to make her insides quiver with longing, he had changed. Yes, he was proposing marriage. But not out of love-out of revenge. And Ann knew she had no choice but to say yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heath intended to make Ann pay for running out on him.

  <description>As lawyers on opposing sides of a messy divorce case, Paige Hart and Ross Bennett ought to have kept matters purely professional, yet Paige and Ross came to loathe each other with an intensity that was strictly &lt;br /&gt;personal. The bad blood between them takes on an unexpected new dimension when the infuriated pair is forced to share a hospital room, when they're quarantined after being exposed to the rare and highly contagious Tibetan Concupiscence Virus that's reputed to shift sensual desire into high gear. When symptoms (which a nonmedical person might mistake for pure and simple lust) start showing up way ahead of schedule, the lawyers' objections to each other are overruled -- and they enjoy every minute of it. But, after the doctors declare that the disease has run its course, Paige and Ross are still feverish with a longing for one another that they hope will never be cured. When the verdict comes in, will they be sentenced to life -- in love? The trend toward funny, sexy contemporary romance has been around for a while, but Trish Jensen offers readers a fresh (in both senses of the word) take on this popular genre.</description>

  <description>Drew Doyle's done a lot of stupid things in his life, but the biggest mistake by far was not paying attention to that 2% failure rate listed on the back of the condom box. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew in Blue is the story of a thirty-six year old loner unexpectedly saddled with the task of raising a baby while trying to sort out his mess of a life. Problem is, he just keeps making things worse for himself. It's a running theme in Drew's life, considering he never does anything the easy way. The River's View, Pennsylvania gossip mill is watching each misstep as Drew juggles a price-gouging babysitter, a major case of artist's block, and a best friend with an opinion to share on every bungled choice he makes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His love life isn't faring much better. Despite a long history of relationships that never really get off the ground, he falls head over heels for someone new, hoping that she might be the one to end his romantic bad luck streak. Things finally start looking up for Drew, until he finds out (the hard way, naturally) that this new love interest isn't the one for him after all. Turns out, it's actually lifelong pal, and high school girlfriend, Kristina Moser. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drew's feelings for Kris intensify as he witnesses her growing bond with his son, and he finally realizes where he belongs. Now all he has to do is convince Kris he's right ... and she's just not buying it.</description>

      <![CDATA[It was a really great read. The main character was flawed but not too flawed. It would have been nice for some of the story to come from the female interest's point of view but other than that, it was a really solid read. ]]>

  <description>When twenty-eight-year-old Lexi Smart wakes up in a London hospital, she’s in for a big surprise. Her teeth are perfect. Her body is toned. Her handbag is Vuitton. Having survived a car accident—in a Mercedes no less—Lexi has lost a big chunk of her memory, three years to be exact, and she’s about to find out just how much things have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow Lexi went from a twenty-five-year-old working girl to a corporate big shot with a sleek new loft, a personal assistant, a carb-free diet, and a set of glamorous new friends. And who is this gorgeous husband—who also happens to be a multimillionaire? With her mind still stuck three years in reverse, Lexi greets this brave new world determined to be the person she…well, seems to be. That is, until an adorably disheveled architect drops the biggest bombshell of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Lexi is scrambling to catch her balance. Her new life, it turns out, comes complete with secrets, schemes, and intrigue. How on earth did all this happen? Will she ever remember? And what will happen when she does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same wicked humor and delicious charm that have won her millions of devoted fans, Sophie Kinsella, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Shopaholic &amp;amp; Baby, returns with an irresistible new novel and a fresh new heroine who finds herself in a life-changing and utterly hilarious predicament…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Mills &amp;amp; Boon Blush series brings you moving, true-to-life romances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meggie is coming to stay!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Normally, architect Sam Solomon would be thrilled that his daughter, Meggie, is coming to live with him. But he's not happy with the circumstances. His ex-wife has suddenly become ill and is unable to take care of their daughter. On top of that, Sam has just started a huge restoration job that promises to eat up all his time. And Meggie is a handful, requiring a lot more attention than an average ten-year-old because she's mentally handicapped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Taking care of his daughter is a full-time job, so Sam hires a nanny, Christy Lane. Before he knows it, Christy has the unruly Meggie cleaning up her toys, eating her vegetables and playing sports. Christy is so different from any woman he's ever met it's as if she's from a whole other world. A world he never would've known if it wasn't for the child who brought them together .</description>

But the only woman who can help him is about to be burned at the stake! Zia, a talented healer, has been branded a witch by vicious local villagers. Swooping in to save her at the very last moment, Artair swears to protect her . . . even if the only way to keep her safe is to pretend to be her beloved husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Tempting Alliance. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marry this savage stranger? Never! Yet the beautiful and determined Zia soon realizes that she needs Artair's help to proceed with her life's work. She submits to their risky charade, growing closer to Artair all the while. Hunted by treacherous enemies, they escape to a wild, wooded place deep in the Scottish Highlands, where unexpected desires ignite . . . and Zia finds herself utterly, wholly under the Highlander's spell.</description>

  <description>George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel—a scathing satire on a downtrodden society’s blind march towards totalitarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned—a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.</description>
