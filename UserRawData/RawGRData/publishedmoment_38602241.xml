  <description>When the two strangers turn up at Rowena Cooper's isolated Colorado farmhouse, she knows instantly that it's the end of everything. For the two haunted and driven men, on the other hand, it's just another stop on a long and bloody journey. And they still have many miles to go, and victims to sacrifice, before their work is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For San Francisco homicide detective Valerie Hart, their trail of victims--women abducted, tortured and left with a seemingly random series of objects inside them--has brought her from obsession to the edge of physical and psychological destruction. And she's losing hope of making a breakthrough before that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the murders at the Cooper farmhouse didn't quite go according to plan. There was a survivor, Rowena's ten-year-old daughter Nell, who now holds the key to the killings. Injured, half-frozen, terrified, Nell has only one place to go. And that place could be even more dangerous than what she's running from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this extraordinary, pulse-pounding debut, Saul Black takes us deep into the mind of a psychopath, and into the troubled heart of the woman determined to stop him.</description>

  <description>Six years ago, Melody Pieterson was attacked and left for dead. Only a chance encounter with a dog walker saved her life. Melody's neighbor and close friend David Alden was found guilty of the crime and imprisoned, and the attack and David's betrayal of her friendship left Melody a different person. She no longer trusts her own judgment, she no longer trusts her friends. In fact, she no longer really has any friends. She's built a life behind walls and gates and security codes; she's cloistered herself away from the world almost entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, soon after David is released from prison, Eve Elliot is murdered in an attack almost identical to Melody's. With the start of a new police investigation, Melody is suddenly pulled from her ordered, secluded life and back into the messy world around her. But as she learns more about Eve's murder, Melody starts to wonder if perhaps David hadn't betrayed her after all...if perhaps the killer is someone else entirely, someone who's still out there, preparing to strike again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated alternately by Melody and by Eve's lingering ghost, &lt;i&gt;The Life I Left Behind&lt;/i&gt; is a taut thriller and an intimate look at two young women bound together in ways neither of them could ever have predicted. Colette McBeth has proven once again that she is a master of suspense.</description>

  <description>'Family curses don't exist. Sure, some families seem to suffer more pain than others, but a curse? An actual curse? I don't think so.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A family tragedy was the catalyst for Ian Perkins to return to the isolated cottage with his wife and young son. But now they are back, it seems yet more grief might befall the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still time to act, but that means Ian must face the uncomfortable truth about his past. And in doing so, he must uncover the truth behind the supposed family curse.</description>

  <description>Grace Backer had a life full of tragedy. But despite everything, she raised her son, Tom, with her secret intact. Tom is a prodigal child, destined to escape the slums of the East End of London for a better life; circumstances will make him flee his loving mother and their home much sooner than expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom starts a new life in Odessa, Russia, and with the help of new-found friends starts a business. At last, he is finally accepted into a new and loving family, but one which holds its own dark secrets. A chance meeting with the son of a duke of the realm leads to close friendship and a new business partnership. When Tom decides to move his company to London and have his regal new friend run it, the firm thrives. However, not everything is as it seems, and Tom's business soon conceals dangerous secrets of its own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, when Tom finally decides to return to London, he is a wanted man, one hunted by the intelligence agencies. If he is finally to be reunited with his beloved mother and his best friend, he must fight to put the past behind him. But keeping secrets is never easy.</description>

  <description>WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN FROM HIM HE WENT AFTER HER AND SEALED HER FATE – HIS TOO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racked by guilt over his accidental killing of a young Italian girl, contract killer André Warner has effectively retired himself from his ‘profession’ and taken to drink and other palliatives, while sinking slowly into a mire of depression.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A contract in Tangier to assassinate an Arab drug trafficker lures him out of retirement and self-pity. Soon after his arrival he encounters attractive American widow, Clair Power, and her precocious sixteen year-old daughter, Lizzy, who bears such a striking resemblance to the girl Warner killed that his waning anguish is instantly rekindled. He attempts to assuage it by embarking on a fling with Clair which brings him into conflict with a mysterious Dutchman named Rik de Bruin, who also appears to have designs on her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The contract on the drug merchant is cancelled with no explanation given, but Warner, now seriously involved with Clair, is more relieved than disappointed. Their budding romance is not destined to blossom however. Clair disappears and Warner is landed with the role of de facto guardian to Lizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In tracking down Clair, Warner crosses a line that brings him into conflict with the local police and he is deported from Tangier with a distraught Lizzy in tow. Back at his Andorra villa she slowly recovers from her mother’s disappearance and launches an assault on Warner’s good intentions. Her increasingly provocative behavior disturbs yet excites him, and when Rik de Bruin pitches up in Andorra and begins to take an interest in Lizzy too, Warner gets possessive the only way he knows.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too late, alas, to save Lizzy from an unspeakable fate.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRAND NEW FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;THE SISTERS OF ST. CROIX&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;THE THROWAWAY CHILDREN&lt;/i&gt; AND &lt;i&gt;THE GIRL WITH NO NAME&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wynsdown, 1949. In the small Somerset village of Wynsdown, Charlotte Shepherd is happily married to farmer Billy. She arrived from Germany on the Kindertransport as a child during the war and now feels settled in her adopted home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the squire's fighter pilot son, Felix, has returned to the village with a fiancée in tow. Daphne is beautiful, charming... and harbouring secrets. After meeting during the war, Felix knows some of Daphne's past, but she has worked hard to conceal that which could unravel her carefully built life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Charlotte, too, a dangerous past is coming back in the shape of fellow refugee, bad boy Harry Black. Forever bound by their childhoods, Charlotte will always care for him, but Harry's return disrupts the village quiet and it's not long before gossip spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war may have ended, but for these girls, trouble is only just beginning. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Lisa has escaped from Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport. She arrives in London unable to speak a word of English, her few belongings crammed into a small suitcase. Among them is one precious photograph of the family she has left behind. Lonely and homesick, Lisa is adopted by a childless couple. But when the Blitz blows her new home apart, she wakes up in hospital with no memory of who she is or where she came from. The authorities give her a new name and dispatch her to a children's home. With the war raging around her, what will become of Lisa now?</description>

  <description>Witch and werewolf were living in harmony but then he had to ruin it all by hitting something nasty like nosferatu. &lt;br /&gt;Now vampires have the Irish couple in their sights and Ciaran Connolly’s old enemies will have to become his greatest allies if he’s to survive. The night has once again become a scary place; will anyone really win in the battle of the monsters? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second novel in the thrilling Diary of the Wolf series, where monsters walk the streets of cosmopolitan Dublin City and hunters stalk the hills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“The darkness I felt before was just a shade compared to the black hole I fell in to. I finally found a lead and I threw it away, I stupidly threw it away. The vampire had spoken of plans and schemes, why the hell didn't I keep him alive, why did I have to kill him?”</description>

  <description>‘Hi, I’m Angela. My husband ran off with the caterer we hired for our daughter’s graduation party – pleased to meet you.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Angie Shepherd who, after 24 years and 11 months of marriage, finds herself divorced and driven by friends and family to move on. From hangover to makeover, Angie steps firmly away from the sensible knitwear, and launches into every adventure on offer – from baking classes and book groups, to speed dating, and even ‘The Granny-Okes’, a 1980s tribute act and YouTube sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Angie needs more than a bar of galaxy and a night in with Murder She Wrote... what she dreams of is entrepreneurial success. Channelling her inner Richard Branson, the light bulb moment happens: it’s time to take the plunge and invest her divorce settlement into The Mercury Travel Club, an exciting new business venture. But as the Travel Club gets going, things never go according to plan, and in this digital age a little chaos brings the fame she’s been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in present-day Manchester, this classic mid-life journey features the 1980s soundtrack from Angie’s youth, and sees her travel the world whilst coping with life after the Ex. Angie’s journey is the catalyst her friends need to examine their own lives; as they start to find their true callings, will Angie find hers? Witty, entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny, this feel-good debut novel shows it’s never too late for a second</description>

  <description>Mark Chadwick is cycling home from work, eager to get back to his pregnant wife Katy and two children, when he sees the police calling at his house. He knows exactly why they are there and he knows that the world he has carefully constructed over twenty deliberately uneventful years is about to fall apart. He could lose everything.&lt;br /&gt;A story of a toxic love gone wrong, with a setting that moves easily between present day London and 1990s Cambridge, Stronger Than Skin is compulsively readable, combining a gripping narrative with a keen eye for the absurdities of the way we live now.</description>

  <description>When Special Agent Will Trent arrives in Grant County, he finds a police department determined to protect its own and far too many unanswered questions about a prisoner's death. He doesn't understand why Officer Lena Adams is hiding secrets from him. He doesn't understand her role in the death of Grant County's popular police chief. He doesn't understand why that man's widow, Dr. Sara Linton, needs him now more than ever to help her crack this case. &lt;br /&gt;While the police force investigates the murder of a young woman pulled from a frigid lake, Trent investigates the police force, putting pressure on Adams just when she's already about to crack. Caught between two complicated and determined women, trying to understand Linton's passionate distrust of Adams, the facts surrounding Chief Tolliver's death, and the complexities of this insular town, Trent will unleash a case filled with explosive secrets--and encounter a thin blue line that could be murderous if crossed.</description>

  <description>Based around a series of true events. The BBC's current affairs programme 'Panorama' undertook a sixty minute documentary / expose surrounding an elite government task force that went undercover in Sheffield over a period of twelve months. Their remit was to use the Proceeds of Crime Act to fill up the police federations coffers using illegally gained intelligence, on one hand overlooking - and in some cases encouraging - major criminal activity such as murder, kidnap and torture; whilst on the other, surreptitiously acquiring pre-bargained guilty pleas from defendants then reneging on deals, which culminated in some of the heaviest sentences ever handed out in the UK. But the programme was never aired."</description>

  <description>Detective Sergeant Taylor Nicks is back and in charge of tracking down a sadistic vigilante, with a penchant for torturing paedophiles, in this unsettling crime thriller by a real-life police sergeant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High-powered businessmen are turning up tortured around the city of Edinburgh with one specific thing in common -- a sinister double life involving pedophilia. Leaving his 'victims' in a disturbing state, the individual responsible calls the police and lays bare the evidence of their targets' twisted misdemeanours to discover, along with a special memento of their own troubled past -- a chilling calling card. Once again heading the investigation team is Detective Sergeant Taylor Nicks, along with her partner Detective Constable Marcus Black, who are tasked not only with tracking the perpetrator down but also dealing with the unusual scenario of having to arrest the victims for their own barbarous crimes. But with the wounded piling up the predator's thirst for revenge intensifies and soon Nicks discovers that she is no longer chasing down a sinister attacker but a deadly serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivid, dark and deeply unsettling Porcelain: Flesh of Innocents is the perfect next read for serious crime and police thriller fans.</description>

  <description>Cass is having a hard time since the night she saw the car in the woods, on the winding rural road, in the middle of a downpour, with the woman sitting inside—the woman who was killed. She’s been trying to put the crime out of her mind; what could she have done, really? It’s a dangerous road to be on in the middle of a storm. Her husband would be furious if he knew she’d broken her promise not to take that shortcut home. And she probably would only have been hurt herself if she’d stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since then, she’s been forgetting every little thing: where she left the car, if she took her pills, the alarm code, why she ordered a pram when she doesn’t have a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing she can’t forget is that woman, the woman she might have saved, and the terrible nagging guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the silent calls she’s receiving, or the feeling that someone’s watching her…</description>

  <description>The second in the Hampstead Murders series opens with a sudden death at an iconic local venue, which some of the team believe may be connected with an unsolved murder featuring Cold War betrayals worthy of George Smiley. It soon emerges that none other than Agatha Christie herself may be the key witness who is able to provide the missing link. As with its bestselling predecessor, Death in Profile, the book develops the lives and loves of the team at 'Hampstead Nick'. While the next phase of a complicated love triangle plays itself out, the protagonists, struggling to crack not one but two apparently insoluble murders, face issues of national security in working alongside Special Branch. On one level a classic whodunit, this quirky and intelligent read harks back not only to the world of Agatha Christie, but also to the Cold War thrillers of John Le Carre, making it a worthy successor to Death in Profile which was dubbed 'a love letter to the detective novel'.</description>

  <description>An enigmatic policeman - currently the subject of an internal investigation - is found burned to death in his car on the Southend sea front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vulnerable young woman, fresh out of the care system, is trying to discover the truth behind the sudden death of her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As DS Frank Pearson and DC Catherine Russell from the Essex Police Major Investigation Team are brought in to solve the mystery that surrounds their colleague's death, they're under intense pressure to crack the case without damaging the force's reputation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a dramatic turn of events casts a whole new light on both cases, the way forward is far from clear. Were the victims connected in some way? And just how much should Pearson and Russell reveal to their bosses as they begin to unearth some dark secrets that the force would rather keep buried?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Hardie's stylish and gripping debut introduces a brilliant new detective duo to the world of crime fiction, weaving together two suspenseful stories that end in a breath-taking finale.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old Ethan Forsythe, an exceptionally talented boy obsessed with physics and astronomy, has been raised alone by his mother in Sydney, Australia. Claire, a former professional ballerina, has been a wonderful parent to Ethan, but he’s becoming increasingly curious about his father’s absence in his life. Claire is fiercely protective of her talented, vulnerable son—and of her own feelings. But when Ethan falls ill, tied to a tragic event that occurred during his infancy, her tightly-held world is split open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thousands of miles away on the western coast of Australia, Mark is trying to forget about the events that tore his family apart, but an unexpected call forces him to confront his past and return home. When Ethan secretly intercepts a letter from Mark to Claire, he unleashes long-suppressed forces that—like gravity—pull the three together again, testing the limits of love and forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Told from the alternating points of view of Ethan and each of his parents, &lt;i&gt;Relativity&lt;/i&gt; is a poetic and soul-searing exploration of unbreakable bonds, irreversible acts, the limits of science, and the magnitude of love.</description>

  <description>On Halloween, 1991, a popular high school basketball star ventures into the woods near Battle Creek, Pennsylvania, and disappears. Three days later, he’s found with a bullet in his head and a gun in his hand—a discovery that sends tremors through this conservative community, already unnerved by growing rumors of Satanic worship in the region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of this incident, bright but lonely Hannah Dexter is befriended by Lacey Champlain, a dark-eyed, Cobain-worshiping bad influence in lip gloss and Doc Martens. The charismatic, seductive Lacey forges a fast, intimate bond with the impressionable Dex, making her over in her own image and unleashing a fierce defiance that neither girl expected. But as Lacey gradually lures Dex away from her safe life into a feverish spiral of obsession, rebellion, and ever greater risk, an unwelcome figure appears on the horizon—and Lacey’s secret history collides with Dex’s worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns a shocking story of love and violence and an addictive portrait of the intoxication of female friendship, set against the unsettled backdrop of a town gripped by moral panic, Girls on Fire is an unflinching and unforgettable snapshot of girlhood: girls lost and found, girls strong and weak, girls who burn bright and brighter—and some who flicker away.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A dramatic and terrifying memoir of a ‘catfish’ scenario - when a woman meets a man online but nothing is what it seems.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;With one click she found her perfect man. And he found his perfect victim. A true story of the ultimate deception.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25-year-old Megan Henley put her five-year-old daughter to bed one evening and switched on her laptop. A Facebook ‘friend request’ seemed to be genuine. There were a few common friends and very similar interests, so Megan accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that one simple act, she changed her life forever. In her words: ‘looking back on it, it was as if I had opened my front door to a stranger, as if I had thrown away every precaution I’d ever put in place, as if I had freely given access to my whole world – all because of some naïve belief that it was ‘just’ a friend request on a social media site.’ Megan is tricked into a relationship, paranoia and ultimately betrayal by the man she loved and trusted but nothing is as it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lisa Gardner's runaway &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller--a fast-paced thrill ride featuring Detective D. D. Warren.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years ago, carefree college student Flora Dane was kidnapped while on spring break. For 472 days, Flora learned just how much one person can endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously alive after her ordeal, Flora has spent the past five years reacquainting herself with the rhythms of normal life, working with her FBI victim advocate, Samuel Keynes. She has a mother who's never stopped loving her, a brother who is scared of the person she's become, and a bedroom wall covered with photos of other girls who've never made it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Boston detective D. D. Warren is called to the scene of a crime--a dead man and the bound, naked woman who killed him--she learns that Flora has tangled with three other suspects since her return to society. Is Flora a victim or a vigilante? And with her firsthand knowledge of criminal behavior, could she hold the key to rescuing a missing college student whose abduction has rocked Boston? When Flora herself disappears, D.D. realizes a far more sinister predator is out there. One who's determined that this time, Flora Dane will never escape. And now it is all up to D. D. Warren to&lt;i&gt; find her.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>At the heart of this tense and at times times darkly comic novel is the relationship between two brothers bound by a terrible crime. Paul and Mikey are on the run, apparently from the press surrounding their house after Mikey’s release from prison. His crime – child murder, committed when he was a boy. As they travel, they move from one disturbing scenario to the next, eventually involving themselves with a bizarre religious cult. The power between the brothers begins to shift, and we realise there is more to their history than Paul has allowed us to know.</description>

  <description>The Otherside: a world that exists on the outskirts of our own, hiding in plain sight and living within our shadows. Shielded from humanity, the Otherside is watched over by the BTCO, a highly secret government agency whose agents are the few humans who possess "The Knack," a genetic anomaly that allows them to see the truth of existence. Franklyn "Bermuda" Jones is the BTCO's finest agent, the only human to have passed to The Otherside and returned. Gifted with the ability to physically interact with The Otherside, he reluctantly stands between both worlds, pining for the life he had to leave behind. Teamed with the Otherside warrior, Argyle, the two of them are assigned a case of a missing woman, vanished under peculiar circumstances. As Bermuda delves further into the disappearances, he uncovers a threat to humanity that will not only break the truce between the two worlds, but render them both obsolete.</description>

  <description>An estranged father’s weekend with his beloved five-year-old daughter turns into a nightmare when she gets into the lift of a city centre tower block and goes down without him. She vanishes without a trace. It sets off a race against time, and a nationwide manhunt, to find her. As the police investigation closes in, suspicion falls on those closest to her - with devastating consequences. Daddy Dearest is a terrifying story of love, obsession and psychological meltdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'My daughter has always had a thing about lifts. There’s something about the thrill of pressing a button and seeing the lift doors close which excites her imagination. It terrifies me. Every time she walks in, I imagine it’s the last time I’ll see her. What if she hits the button before I get there? What if the lift doors close and I can’t get her out? It drives me nuts. There are eight floors in the Sears building, nine if you count the basement, and the lift is fast: more like a fairground ride, really. It does top to bottom in twelve seconds. I’ve timed it. Taking the stairs, I’ve done it in forty-two. That leaves a gap of thirty seconds. You’d be surprised what can happen in that time. I was.'</description>

  <description>England is in crisis. King Edward has no heir and promises never to produce one. There are no obvious successors available to replace him, but quite a few claimants are eager to take the crown. While power struggles break out between the various factions at court, enemies abroad plot to make England their own. There are raids across the borders with Wales and Scotland. Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, is seen by many as the one man who can bring stability to the kingdom. He has powerful friends and two women who love him, but he has enemies who will stop at nothing to gain power. As 1066 begins, England heads for an uncertain future. It seems even the heavens are against Harold. Intelligent and courageous, can Harold forge his own destiny - or does he have to bow to what fates impose?</description>

  <description>It's summer 1995 and Dan Willis is living in Santander, northern Spain, trying to get his life back on track, when he receives an unexpected call from an old school friend and Gulf War veteran, Billy Wyatt, who wants to visit him. Unbeknown to Billy, Dan invites two other school friends to join them. It s a decision that will change their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last Fiesta&lt;/i&gt; follows the friends' hedonistic journey through the stunning Basque country, up into the Picos de Europa and finally to Pamplona, for the running of the bulls. But under the blistering Spanish sun, dark truths from the past emerge, and dreadful revelations entwine their lives in a way that will ultimately lead to disaster.</description>

  <description>A powerful novel of friendship, rebellion and betrayal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;England, 1950s. While out playing in the woods, ten-year-old Mark meets a man living in an old railway carriage. Despite his wild appearance, the stranger, who introduces himself as Aubrey Hillyard, is captivating – an irreverent outsider who is shunned by Mark’s fellow villagers, and a writer to boot. Aubrey encourages Mark to tell stories about his own make-believe world, and in return he informs the boy about a novel he is writing – a work of ominous science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the meddling villagers plot to drive Aubrey out, Mark finds himself caught between two worlds – yet convinced that he must help Aubrey prevail at any cost. Dealing with powerful themes of friendship, rebellion and betrayal, The Summer of Broken Stories is James Wilson’s long-awaited new novel.</description>

All of it comes to an end on a rainy saturday night in London. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Helen is ripped from the world by the notorious Drayton family on a visit to the capital and the police, including the prodigal Officer Starling, do little to bring them to justice, Lucas embarks on a rain soaked London to put things right himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises and the ripple effects of the escalating violence reaches further than he could have imagined, Lucas has to confront his dark past, his continuous grief, a nationwide police hunt and, of course, the Draytons.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One by One. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A riveting story of revenge and redemption with hard-hitting action and heart-wrenching grief, One by One is a must for fans of Crime Thrillers.</description>

  <description>A dazzling novel from bestselling writer Maggie O'Farrell, winner of the Costa Novel Award—an irresistible love story that crisscrosses continents and time zones as it captures an extraordinary marriage, and an unforgettable family, with wit, humor, and deep affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Daniel Sullivan, a man with a complicated life. A New Yorker living in the wilds of Ireland, he has children he never sees in California, a father he loathes in Brooklyn, and a wife, Claudette, who is a reclusive ex–film star given to pulling a gun on anyone who ventures up their driveway. Claudette was once the most glamorous and infamous woman in cinema before she staged her own disappearance and retreated to blissful seclusion in an Irish farmhouse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the life Daniel and Claudette have so carefully constructed is about to be disrupted by an unexpected discovery about a woman Daniel lost touch with twenty years ago. This revelation will send him off-course, far away from wife, children and home. Will his love for Claudette be enough to bring him back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Must be the Place is a novel about family, identity, and true love: an intimately drawn portrait of a marriage, both the forces that hold it together and the pressures that drive it apart. O'Farrell writes with complexity, insight, and laugh-out-loud humor in a narrative that hurtles forward with powerful velocity and emotion. This Must be the Place is a sophisticated, spellbinding summer read from one of the UK's most highly acclaimed and best-loved novelists.</description>

  <description>The 2016 debut bloggers can't stop raving about. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt; The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Ice Twins&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You might not want to like them, but you do. Though, you’d like to get to know Grace better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But it’s difficult, because you realise Jack and Grace are never apart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might call this true love. Others might ask why Grace never answers the phone. Or how she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesn’t work. How she can cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim. And why there are bars on one of the bedroom windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the perfect marriage is the perfect lie.</description>

It made a huge impact on the capital city and brought the whole country to mourning. I think that's part of the reason why I was so intrigued to read 'The Theseus Paradox'. I was interested...</a>]]>

  <description>First in a new series from Graham Masterton, starring the apothecary's daughter, Beatrice Scarlet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1750: Beatrice Scarlet is the apothecary's daughter. She can mix medicines and herbs to save the lives of her neighbours - but, try as she might, she can't save the lives of her parents. An orphan at just sixteen, Beatrice marries a preacher and emigrates to America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Hampshire, 1756: In the farming community where Beatrice now lives, six pigs are found viciously slaughtered; slices of looking-glass embedded in their mouths. According to scripture, this is the work of Satan - but Beatrice Scarlet suspects the hands of men. As she closes in on the killer, she must act quickly to unmask him - or become the next victim herself...</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestseller Lisa Gardner, author of  &lt;i&gt;Catch Me&lt;/i&gt;  and  &lt;i&gt;Love You More&lt;/i&gt;,  returns with a heart-thumping thriller about what lurks behind the facade of a perfect family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is my family:  Vanished without a trace…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin and Libby Denbe have the kind of life that looks good in the pages of a glossy magazine. A beautiful fifteen-year old daughter, Ashlyn. A gorgeous brownstone on a tree-lined street in Boston’s elite Back Bay neighborhood. A great marriage, admired by friends and family.  A perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is what I know:  Pain has a flavor…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When investigator Tessa Leoni arrives at the crime scene in the Denbes’ home, she finds scuff marks on the floor and Taser confetti in the foyer.  The family appears to have been abducted, with only a pile of their most personal possessions remaining behind.  No witnesses, no ransom demands, no motive.  Just an entire family, vanished without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is what I fear:  The worst is yet to come…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa knows better than anyone that even the most perfect façades can hide the darkest secrets.  Now she must race against the clock to uncover the Denbes’ innermost dealings, a complex tangle of friendships and betrayal, big business and small sacrifices. Who would want to kidnap such a perfect little family?  And how far would such a person be willing to go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the truth:  Love, safety, family…it is all touch and go.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her seventeenth Alexandra Cooper novel, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Linda Fairstein delivers an edge-of-your-seat thriller that explores the secrets—and terrible danger—of New York City’s waterfront.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Manhattan waterfront is one of New York City’s most beautiful vistas, boasting both the noble Statue of Liberty and the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest for motor vehicles. But in &lt;i&gt;Devil’s Bridge&lt;/i&gt;, Assistant DA Alex Cooper will discover the menace that lurks in this seemingly benign corner of New York City as she and Detective Mike Chapman, in the midst of their own growing relationship, take on a case that forces them into their most vulnerable positions yet—apart from each other, as a killer’s twisted plan draws ever closer to home.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Number One bestselling crime thriller from the award-winning Stuart MacBride. A bloody, brilliant and brutal story of murder, kidnap and revenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Constable Ash Henderson has a dark secret…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago his daughter, Rebecca, went missing on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. A year later the first card arrived: home-made, with a Polaroid picture stuck to the front – Rebecca, strapped to a chair, gagged and terrified. Every year another card: each one worse than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tabloids call him ‘The Birthday Boy’. He’s been snatching girls for twelve years, always in the run-up to their thirteenth birthday, sending the families his home-made cards showing their daughters being slowly tortured to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ash hasn’t told anyone about Rebecca’s birthday cards – they all think she’s just run away from home – because if anyone finds out, he’ll be taken off the investigation. And he’s sacrificed too much to give up before his daughter’s killer gets what he deserves…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I don't know where you are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know what I've done...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenager Abigail Ryder is devastated when she gets home from school to find her family gone. Nothing makes sense. Things are missing from the house and her stepsisters' room is completely empty. But the police think she's trouble, and when grandmother Eleanor tells her to forget them all and move on, there's no choice other than face the future - alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years on, Abi and Adam are a happy couple on the verge of parenthood. But when the past comes back to haunt Abi, the only way forward is to go back and uncover the truth - and reveal the dreadful secrets a mother has been hiding all these years.</description>

  <description>‘Honey is sweet, but the bee stings’ and Blake Hetherington knows this only too well. Blake is a gentleman in modern times; a milliner with mystery solving thrust upon him. Delilah is an enthusiastic archaeologist with an unhealthy interest in murder; DS Rob Claringdon is her beau. This unlikely trio is at the heart of a quirky, amusing and quintessentially English, murder mystery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Live and Let Bee’, finds our heroes on a remote feudal island to celebrate a wedding, but after two mysterious deaths, are they able to resist investigating a case that involves warring honey farms, Russian oligarchs and a dark family secret?</description>

  <description>Gloria is tired of her ordinary life. She barely recognizes the free-spirited girl she used to be in the unadventurous teenager she has become. So when a mysterious boy bent on breaking the rules strolls into her classroom, Gloria is ready to fall under his spell. Uman is funny, confident and smart. He does whatever he likes and doesn't care what anyone thinks of him. The only people for him are the mad ones, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn. He is everything Gloria wishes to be. He can whisk her away from the life she loathes and show her a more daring, more exciting one, in which the only limits are the boundaries of her own boldness. But Uman in not all he seems and by the time she learns the truth about him, she is a long way from home and everyone wants to know, Where's Gloria?</description>

  <description>A former intelligence agent stands accused of terrorism, held without charge in a secret overseas prison. His memoir is in the hands of a brilliant but erratic psychologist whose annotations paint a much darker picture. As the story unravels, we are forced to assess the truth for ourselves, and decide not only what really happened on one fateful overseas assignment but who is the real terrorist. Peopled by a diverse and unforgettable cast of characters, whose reliability as narrators is always questioned, and with a multi-layered plot heaving with unexpected and often shocking developments, &lt;i&gt;Jihadi: A Love Story&lt;/i&gt; is an intelligent thriller that asks big questions.&lt;br /&gt; Complex, intriguing and intricately woven, this is an astonishing debut that explores the nature of good and evil alongside notions of nationalism, terrorism and fidelity, and, above all, the fragility of the human mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Smart and searing’ &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ’Captivating, remarkably original … it is a book of our time’ Edward Wilson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘An exquisitely drawn debut that twists and turns to its stunning conclusion’ Cal Moriarty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘&lt;i&gt;Jihadi&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping tale if a clash of cultures and individuals told with panache, dazzling wit and remorseless intelligence’ Willian Ryan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Intelligently written and multi-layered … simply enchanting’ Qaisra Shahraz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Bold and skilfully executed … bravely tackles a complex and timely subject’ Frankie Gaffney</description>

  <description>An exquisitely talented young British author makes her American debut with this rapturously acclaimed historical novel, set in late nineteenth-century England, about an intellectually minded young widow, a pious vicar, and a rumored mythical serpent that explores questions about science and religion, skepticism, and faith, independence and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cora Seaborne’s brilliant, domineering husband dies, she steps into her new life as a widow with as much relief as sadness: her marriage was not a happy one. Wed at nineteen, this woman of exceptional intelligence and curiosity was ill-suited for the role of society wife. Seeking refuge in fresh air and open space in the wake of the funeral, Cora leaves London for a visit to coastal Essex, accompanied by her inquisitive and obsessive eleven-year old son, Francis, and the boy’s nanny, Martha, her fiercely protective friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While admiring the sites, Cora learns of an intriguing rumor that has arisen further up the estuary, of a fearsome creature said to roam the marshes claiming human lives. After nearly 300 years, the mythical Essex Serpent is said to have returned, taking the life of a young man on New Year’s Eve. A keen amateur naturalist with no patience for religion or superstition, Cora is immediately enthralled, and certain that what the local people think is a magical sea beast may be a previously undiscovered species. Eager to investigate, she is introduced to local vicar William Ransome. Will, too, is suspicious of the rumors. But unlike Cora, this man of faith is convinced the rumors are caused by moral panic, a flight from true belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These seeming opposites who agree on nothing soon find themselves inexorably drawn together and torn apart—an intense relationship that will change both of their lives in ways entirely unexpected.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: See Alternate Cover Edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35388144-cause-she-s-a-good-girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HERE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN SUSPENSE NOVEL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Banion spent most of her eighteen years trying to do the impossible—gain her abusive mother’s love. Now, she realizes that some dreams are the word ‘hopeless’ spelled backwards. Connie will always see her as an “unwanted burden”. Still, it was hard making that life-altering decision to free herself from the chains of her defective childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five years of wandering from one small town to the next, she finds a true friend in Shelly Jamison—runaway mom and devout party girl. When their simple life abruptly changes by some not-so-surprising pink slips, Piper finally gives in to her friend’s invitation to spend the summer at her family’s estate in Destin, California; there, at last, she gets to meet Shelly’s S.E.X.Y. cousin Oz Jamison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz owns a PR firm in Seattle, Washington. Hardly a day goes by that he’s not asked those headache-provoking questions: “Are you Prince? Would you sign my Purple Rain DVD? Better yet, touch me instead?” With skin the color of smooth vanilla, and the sensual glint in those caramel-brown eyes, even a pledged virgin like Piper has to fight off the lure of his sexuality. She opts instead for a friendship based on their shared abusive backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper is determined to forge a better life in California. But the collective cries of nine murdered women reaching out to her from those weekly news bulletins suspends that task. It’s no coincidence that these women who were murdered by the Silk Stocking Serial Killer, are the same ones she’s met before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the chaos of trying to figure out the connection, she learns that someone has taken Shelly. A muffled voice over the phone claims responsibility; and it’s not the Silk Stocking Serial Killer who’s daring her to come rescue her friend.</description>

  <description>At 2 a.m. on the morning of her 40th birthday, Sophie wakes in the darkness of her bedroom, and finds a stranger watching her from the foot of her bed. The intruder hands Sophie a letter and issues an ultimatum: the message is to be opened at her forthcoming party, in front of gathered family and friends, at exactly 8 p.m. Any failure to comply will not end well. Sophie can only think of one person who hates her enough to have hired a professional to menace her like this: her fiancé's ex-wife. But what can the letter possibly contain? And why must it be read in front of everyone she loves best? This will be no ordinary 40th party. Sophie is not the only person holding a secret about the evening ahead. When the clock strikes eight, the course of several people's lives will be altered forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An eerie debut suspense novel that explores how little one man may know his own brother--and his own mind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; The Maguire brothers each have their own driving, single-minded obsession. For Jonathan, it is his magnificent, talented, and desirable wife, Harriet. For Roger, it is the elaborate universe he has constructed in a shed in their parents' garden, populated by millions of tiny insects. While Jonathan's pursuit of Harriet leads him to feelings of jealousy and anguish, Roger's immersion in the world he has created reveals a capability and talent which are absent from his everyday life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger is known to all as a loving, protective, yet simple man, but the ever-growing complexity of the insect farm suggests that he is capable of far more than anyone believes. Following a series of strange and disturbing incidents, Jonathan begins to question every story he has ever been told about his brother--and if he has so completely misjudged Roger's mind, what else might he have overlooked about his family, and himself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the accidents at home multiply and tragedy strikes, a startling picture emerges. One of these brothers is a killer, and the other has no idea.</description>

  <description>Ciaran Connolly's online dating profile became somewhat inaccurate when he was transformed into a werewolf. One bite changed his path from dull mediocrity to a blur of power, women and fights to the death. Now women want his body and hunters want his hide but all Ciaran wants is to pass his exams before the full moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book one in the "Diary of the Wolf" series.</description>

  <description>Juliet Evans has always been a bit of a loner, but the last few years have been particularly shrouded in isolation and silence. Apart from her daily work at the local diner, her life is spent inside the walls of her tiny apartment, just trying to survive…until the one day that U.S. Army Private Tim Collins walks into the diner and takes a seat at one of her tables. By the time the day is over her life has been changed forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private Collins is just a few hours away from being deployed for the first time, to a particularly violent conflict. To say he’s nervous would be an understatement. In his last day stateside all he wants is a little bit of normal. What he finds is the kind heart and sweet spirit of Juliet Collins. She is by his side until the last possible moment, the moment when he asks her to write him while he’s away, promising to do the same in return. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Juliet is afraid to believe his promises, he holds true to them. Letter after letter after letter passes between the two of them…until one day the letters from Tim stop completely, leaving Juliet broken and grieving for the love she had found but would never truly have.</description>

  <description>The genteel façade of London’s Hampstead is shattered by a series of terrifying murders, and the ensuing police hunt is threatened by internal politics, and a burgeoning love triangle within the investigative team. Pressurised by senior officers desperate for a result a new initiative is clearly needed, but what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intellectual analysis and police procedure vie with the gut instinct of ‘copper’s nose’, and help appears to offer itself from a very unlikely source – a famous fictional detective. A psychological profile of the murderer allows the police to narrow down their search, but will Scotland Yard lose patience with the team before they can crack the case?&lt;br /&gt;Praised by fellow authors and readers alike, this is a truly original crime story, speaking to a contemporary audience yet harking back to the Golden Age of detective fiction. Intelligent, quirky and mannered, it has been described as ‘a love letter to the detective novel’. Above it all hovers Hampstead, a magical village evoking the elegance of an earlier time, and the spirit of mystery-solving detectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Fraser-Sampson is an established writer best known for his series of ‘Mapp and Lucia’ novels which have been featured on BBC Radio 4 and optioned by BBC television. This is his debut work of detective fiction, and the first title in the Hampstead Murders series.</description>

      <![CDATA[My book blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://publishedmoments.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://publishedmoments.co.uk</a><br /><br />I love a good crime book and 'Death in Profile' really shows you 'behind the scenes' of the nitty-gritty police work that goes in to solving crimes. Guy Fraser-Sampson has written a classic 'whodunnit' that I couldn't wait to finish.<br /><br />Usually, I love my thrillers...</a>]]>

  <description>Kane’s a country singer who’s tangled with too many deceitful women. He’s learned his lesson: girls are for flirting and fun; emotions are for his music. But after spending a night with an earnest woman unlike any he’s known, he can’t force her out of his mind. So he goes in search of the woman he knows only as “Elle.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her last night in Nashville, the staunchly pragmatic Sabella found herself in a situation more suited to a romance novel than reality. Swept away, she ignored her rigidly self-imposed rules, succumbing to the fantasy just this once. But she knows real-world relationships have nothing in common with their fictionalized portrayals. When Kane unexpectedly shows up at her Portland apartment, she must choose between the practical truths she has learned and the desire for a passionate love she has struggled to suppress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the distance, Kane’s tour schedule, and their meddling friends, both are drawn to the chance for a romance neither quite believes is possible.</description>

  <description>When significant events take place the dramatic scenes can be trapped inside the stone and brickwork of surrounding buildings. When a series of very specific conditions are met, those images are released – rather like old magnetic recording tape – and the whole event comes back to life. This is when people see ‘ghosts’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also the basis of the Stone Tape Theory and a young Scottish aristocrat, Findo Gask, and his business partner and friend, Andrew McCubbin, have discovered what it is that triggers the release of those images frozen into the stone and brick. They call their computer-based system Findo’s Mousetrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mousetrap was the name given to the camera used in 1835 when Henry Fox Talbot took the world’s first photographic negative at Laycock Abbey in Wiltshire in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By applying their science Findo and Andrew are able, quite literally, to turn back the pages of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the drama of Findo’s Mousetrap plays out against a thoroughly 21st Century love story. Findo’s very traditional Scottish roots contrast sharply with Dympna Doyle’s Irish/American upbringing. This creates a highly charged and deeply emotional passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mousetrap continues to amaze as it solves a very modern robbery and relives the moment when Dympna’s grandfather lands at Ellis Island in the United States as a penniless Irish immigrant, almost 100 years ago. It solves a very British Royal mystery and captures the moment when the very first photograph was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findo’s Mousetrap is a fast moving story set on both sides of the Atlantic that examines the emotional turmoils of the two central characters as they battle with their different backgrounds, beliefs and feelings for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ability of Mousetrap to rewind history and relive events as they actually happened is the strength of Findo’s Mousetrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Findo and his friends on an unforgettable journey.</description>

  <description>Dark forces are at work in the House of the Double Axe. Stephan, the thirteen-year-old son of King Minos of Crete, stumbles across a terrifying conspiracy. Is the Minotaur, a half man half bull who eats human flesh, real? Or is something even more dangerous threatening to engulf both the palace and the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephan must race to save his family from a terrible fate and find out what really lurks inside the labyrinth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You think you know the story? Think again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Double Axe is the first instalment in Philip Womack’s Blood and Fire series, which reimagines classical myths from the point of view of teenage protagonists. It’s a thrilling tale of adventure, and an opportunity for young readers to engage with and learn more about classical mythology.</description>

  <description>Ellie Abela’s life has been anything but easy. Tragedy follows her where ever she goes, and she’s been a lot of places. At twenty she’s lived in over ten different states, all because of her dad’s career in medical research. His career is just another list of the causes of tragedies in El’s life. He’s dying, and with every breath he takes closer to Heaven, Ellie dies a little bit inside too. &lt;br /&gt;At twelve she lost her mom in a drunk driving accident, and in a matter of months she fears she’ll lose the last person she has in the world to cancer. &lt;br /&gt;While Ellie’s life has been rife with sadness, Trent Wentworth’s has been a challenge. A drug-addicted mom and a dead-beat dad meant at twenty three he was the adoptive father of his two year old sister. Now at twenty five he’s working his way up the corporate ladder and a struggling single parent. &lt;br /&gt;Each is searching for a cure to the things in their lives dragging them down. &lt;br /&gt;Not all cures are black and white; not all cures save us–and sometimes saving isn’t what we need. Sometimes we just need to realize how lucky we are to be alive, at least for this moment.</description>

  <description>This book tells the story of one man's journey from happiness to despair and back again. At thirty-two and at the peak of health, D.D. Mayers lived in a Kenyan paradise with his beautiful wife. Then tragedy struck; an accident left him paralysed from the waist down, destined to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Mayers takes the reader on an emotional yet witty and amusing tour of his life, guiding us from his childhood (and the 'pointless' schooling he receives) through to his emergence as a young man who somehow finds himself earning money as a professional actor. One role takes him to Kenya, where we meet his wonderful wife, and we join the two for a trip through the Middle East, many years before war ravaged much of its warmth and beauty. After moving to London for a number of years, the couple return to Kenya - only for them to experience a life-changing event. The gripping storytelling throughout the book takes us from the author's despair and feelings of worthlessness all the way through to a final, peaceful contentment. You will laugh and you will cry - but you won't be able to put the book down.</description>

  <description>Maddie Springer is all about fashion. So when her best friend Dana's movie star boyfriend, Ricky Montgomery, becomes a contestant on the ballroom dance reality hit, Dancing with Celebrities, she is over the moon at the thought of visiting the sparkly, spandexy costumes on the set. That is until Ricky's dance partner is found dead in his dressing room... in the nude! Suddenly the police suspect him of murder, Dana suspects him of cheating on her, and the reporters at the L.A. Informer, Hollywood's most notorious tabloid, have dubbed him "Dancing Death". Now it's up to Maddie to clear his name as she wades through a misfit cast of reality show dancers to find out just who has a grudge again the show's star... and who is in danger of taking their final bow next!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fashion designer turned amateur sleuth Maddie Springer is back!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning sickness sucks. Which is why fashion designer turned amateur sleuth Maddie Springer has spent the last six weeks being a couch potato and Moonlight vampire movie devotee. But when Maddie's best friends finally convince her to venture out, Maddie stumbles on a dead body of a girl who has been bitten on the neck, and life suddenly imitates art in the most deadliest of ways. Now Maddie is smack in the middle of a murder investigation involving a deadly dance club and a coven of Hollywood "vampires". Not to mention navigating the world of baby showers, diaper genies and Lamaze classes with her LAPD Homicide detective husband who would rather his pregnant wife not continue popping up in his murder investigation. Between the hormones, the homicides, and a flurry of fangs, Maddie and her gang work to track down the deadly truth... before the killer bites again!</description>

  <description>Maddie Springer is finally walking down the aisle with the man of her dreams. And she's got the perfect wedding planner to pull it all off in style. Well, perfect, that is, until the woman winds up dead - murdered in buttercream icing. Suddenly Maddie's hope of a dream wedding melts faster than an ice sculpture at an outdoor buffet. And when her groom-to-be is assigned the detective in charge of the case, there goes any chance of a honeymoon. Unless, of course, Maddie can find the murderer before her big day. With the help of her fellow fashionista friends, Maddie vows to unveil the cold-blooded killer. Is it the powerful ex-husband, the hot young boy toy, a secret lover from the past, or a billionaire bridezilla on the warpath? As the wedding day grows closer, tempers flare, old flames return, and Maddie's race to the altar turns into a race against time.</description>

  <description>Baguettes, bodies, and haute couture galore! Shoe designer turned amateur sleuth, Maddie Springer, is at it again, this time in fabulously fashionable Paris. When Europe's designer de jour, Jean Luc LeCroix, invites Maddie to show her creations at Paris Fashion Week, Maddie's sure she's died and gone to heaven. That is until Jean Luc's top model is found dead on the runway, stabbed with a familiar stiletto heel. Sure someone is trying to frame her, Maddie enlists the help of her friends, including the sexy Detective Jack Ramirez, to uncover a daring jewel heist, a devious blackmailer, and even a few skeletons lurking in the closets of those closest to her. But as the evidence mounts, Maddie becomes the prime suspect and Ramirez is stuck between a badge and a cute blonde with a tendency for trouble. Will he stand by her as she attempts to track down an international killer, or will this be the case that finally comes between them? One thing's for sure, if Maddie doesn't uncover the real killer soon, she may be saying her final adieu.</description>

  <description>Secret affairs, hunky gardeners, and housewives desperate enough to bare it all... welcome to &lt;i&gt;Magnolia Lane&lt;/i&gt;, TV's hottest new prime time show. A place where L.A. shoe designer Maddie Springer should be in fashion heaven. That is until the body of a rising young starlet is found dead on the show's set. Now it's up to Maddie to sift through a leading lady with a secret, an actor on the verge of a nervous breakdown, a sexy cyber scandal, and one tabloid reporter who'll stop at nothing to get the story of the century. Not to mention Maddie's hot-cold relationship with the case's familiar lead detective, Jack Ramirez. In a world where secrets, lies, and deception can earn you an Oscar, Maddie plays the role of a lifetime to catch Hollywood's hottest killer. But if she doesn't watch her step, Maddie's fifteen minutes of fame just may be her last.</description>

  <description>For eighteen year old Gia Winters, having a movie star for a father, a former Playboy bunny as a mother, a Hollywood mansion, and a closet stocked with Chanel is simply another day in the life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her world is turned upside down when her father mysteriously hires a group of bodyguards to trail the family 24/7 and threatening phone calls from a "Dr. D" start buzzing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gia scores the coveted role of Miss Golden Globe, she is forced to strike a deal with her bodyguard, Jack, who is almost as arrogant as he is attractive. Juggling Gia's romantic failures, fashion faux pas, and celebrity obsessions, the duo investigate a series of clues with the help of a police cadet, who has a special set of skills and an even better set of dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the Golden Globes just around the corner, danger levels rise higher than her stilettos as Gia learns that the biggest secrets might be the ones buried in her own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a place where the hills have eyes, high school nemeses, bad hair days, raging parties, and stolen kisses, there can only be trouble for a girl who was just starting to consider herself lucky.</description>

  <description>Tamsin and Michelle have been inseparable since childhood. Even now they spend all their time together, along with Patrick, Michelle's handsome husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Tamsin's brilliant assistant Bea (without whom Tamsin's life would fall apart) has heard a nasty rumour that Patrick is playing away. Determined to uncover the truth, Tamsin devises a honey-trap to test his resolve, using Bea as bait. But she never counted on Bea having her own agenda . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to untangle the web of deceit, Patrick seems to be constantly one step ahead. Can Tamsin reveal the truth to Michelle without ruining everyone's life along the way?</description>

  <description>Billions will die. Governments will fall. A New World Order will rise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Illuminati, the Deep State, Agenda 21 - to most people they're nothing more than conspiracy theories, but Frank Marshall knows it's all real. And the former Navy SEAL knows what's coming next.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murder of three billion people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it the Angola virus, a lethal pathogen born not in the squalor of an African prison but in the germ-free laboratories controlled by The Committee, a powerful group of global elites who have shaped world events for decades. Now they've decided to reboot humanity and Angola will make it all possible. Unless Frank can stop them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the mean streets of Harlem to the burning deserts of Iraq, from a run-down estate in south London to the barren peaks of the Swiss Alps, Frank will have to travel fast, use every military skill he possesses, if he is to stay one step ahead of the hunter teams and save the world from decimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because speed is everything. And the clock is already ticking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What readers are saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ ‘A gem of a conspiracy thriller.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ ‘A well written, tense thriller. Worth your time.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ ‘Fast-moving action adventure!’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ 'Read the whole book in pretty much one sitting.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ ‘Hugely entertaining and informative take on the Illuminati conspiracy.’</description>

  <description>PARALLEL LINES Putting the past to rest. This is the final instalment of Kiri's tale. Now aged forty-one we find her working at the Courtauld Gallery in London guiding visitors around the exhibits, on her feet all day . . . sometimes seven days a week . . . but loving every minute of it. She has moved to a house with a small garden in Fulham, dyed her hair brown and at last she looks like the picture on the cover of the books. There is a new man around, Graham a millionaire businessman looking for the love of his life. This is partly Graham's story too; he sells cheap imports from China and we watch as he accumulates more and more wealth and money, at the expense of British and European jobs. But these are only the rails along which the parallel lines of Kiri's new life runs; re-building shattered relationships; abandoning others that refuse to be resurrected and attempting to construct meaningful new bonds from the flimsiest materials, mud, straw and a lack of commitment. Meanwhile, Madison and Keith are bidding to rule the world and fill their bank accounts by bringing the North American economy to a standstill. Honest and unsentimental, Kiri embraces the life she has rather than the one she might have hoped for, with her customary restraint and dignity. Engaging from the start, and like the previous novels sensually immersive, the novel begins slowly but builds to an intense and fast-paced contemporary thriller.</description>

  <description>How would you feel if, one day, you discovered everything you thought you knew about your family was a fabrication? Your mother wasn't your mother, your father was a liar and your whole upbringing was a sham. Confronted with this exact situation, Dave Fazackerley doesn't feel great. It doesn't help that he has just buried the woman he thought of as his mother. Or that his wife, his one true soulmate, recently jumped into bed with a librarian. Even his band, his only escape from reality, is going through a rough patch. How will Dave respond? Will he discover the truth about his family? Will his band ever play a gig again? More importantly, can Dave entice his wife back from the arms of the book-dork or will he take a chance on a new love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Six Lies reads in humour and brilliance akin to Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. A wonderful book. I loved every moment of reading it." Becky Walsh - BBC Radio Presenter and author.</description>

  <description>In the first of two new action-packed thrillers by the internationally bestselling author of the Game trilogy, MemoRandom takes you deep inside the world of police intelligence—where secrecy, betrayal, and deadly competition reign supreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Sarac is a handler at the Intelligence Unit of the Stockholm Police Force, identifying, recruiting, and wrangling anyone who can support the police in their battle against organized crime. And David is very good at what he does: manipulation, bribes, and threats—anything goes, so long as he delivers. Other agents can do nothing but watch jealously as his top-secret, high-level informant, Janus, rockets David to success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after David suffers a stroke during a high-speed car chase, crashing violently into the wall of a tunnel, he wakes up in a hospital with no memory at all of Janus or the past two years of his life. David only knows that he has to reconnect with Janus to protect himself and his informants before outside forces bring the whole network crashing down. Fortunately, he has his supportive friends and colleagues to help him rebuild his life…or does he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the award-winning Swedish author who has worked as a police officer and IT security consultant, MemoRandom is a stunning thriller and look inside the secret intelligence community, where you never know who’s on your side.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Big Fish&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt; in this emotionally evocative story about a man, a woman, and an alligator that is a moving tribute to love, from the author of the award-winning memoir &lt;i&gt;Rocket Boys&lt;/i&gt;—the basis of the movie &lt;i&gt;October Sky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsie Lavender and Homer Hickam (the father of the author) were high school classmates in the West Virginia coalfields, graduating just as the Great Depression began. When Homer asked for her hand, Elsie instead headed to Orlando where she sparked with a dancing actor named Buddy Ebsen (yes, that Buddy Ebsen). But when Buddy headed for New York, Elsie’s dreams of a life with him were crushed and eventually she found herself back in the coalfields, married to Homer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfulfilled as a miner’s wife, Elsie was reminded of her carefree days with Buddy every day because of his unusual wedding gift: an alligator named Albert she raised in the only bathroom in the house. When Albert scared Homer by grabbing his pants, he gave Elsie an ultimatum: “Me or that alligator!” After giving it some thought, Elsie concluded there was only one thing to do: Carry Albert home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carrying Albert Home&lt;/i&gt; is the funny, sweet, and sometimes tragic tale of a young couple and a special alligator on a crazy 1000-mile adventure. Told with the warmth and down-home charm that made &lt;i&gt;Rocket Boys/October Sky&lt;/i&gt; a beloved bestseller, Homer Hickam’s rollicking tale is ultimately a testament to that strange and marvelous emotion we inadequately call love.</description>

  <description>Jackson Landis kept secrets. It's how he got girls into bed, the grades he wanted, and a reputation for being the life of the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now he's dead, and no one knows how or why. Especially not the four girls whose secrets he protected. Secrets so scandalous they could cause each girl to lose something valuable. Secrets so dark, someone may have killed for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four girls - a campus drug dealer, an overweight bookworm, a closeted lesbian, and a spoiled princess have one thing in common – they’re terrified the things Jackson knew may not have died with him. As Reggie, Haddie, Val, and Livie try to piece together her own role in Jackson’s death, each girl realizes Jackson had some not-so-pretty skeletons of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which makes a girl wonder, who really wanted Jackson Landis dead?</description>

  <description>The Devil in Disguise &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since he survived a suicide attempt, New York artist Stan Foster has not been himself. Plagued by amnesia and a head full of visions of death and destruction that fuel his ever-more disturbing work, he claws his way through a life he doesn’t recognize in search of his true identity. What he finds leads him to believe he is Satan, spit out from the bowels of hell to live among the mortal inhabitants of earth. Is he delusional, or is there truth behind this troubling revelation? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One woman can help him find out. Enter Abigail: lapsed Catholic, lonely city dweller, and psychiatrist with a heart of gold. Meeting Stan makes her question everything she’s believed about faith and humanity for so long, but she must overcome her own troubled background to offer him the redemption he needs—and ultimately wants.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the adrenaline-laced new novel of suspense from Tom Savage—hailed by Michael Connelly as “a master of the high-speed thriller”—an American actress in Europe races to find the truth behind her husband’s mysterious accident. What she uncovers makes her the target of a shocking conspiracy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Nora Baron’s life is perfect. She lives on Long Island Sound, teaches acting at a local university, and has a loving family. Then one phone call changes everything. She’s informed that her husband, Jeff, has died in a car crash while on a business trip in England. Nora flies to London to identify the body, which the police have listed as a “John Doe.” When she leaves the morgue, a man tries to steal her purse containing Jeff’s personal effects. Clearly, all is not as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; At her hotel, Nora receives a cryptic message that leaves her with more questions than answers. She follows the message’s instructions to France, where a fatal encounter transforms her into a fugitive. Wanted for murder, on the run in a shadowy landscape of lies, secrets, and sudden violence, Mrs. “John Doe” must play the role of a lifetime to stay one step ahead of a ruthless enemy with deadly plans for her—and for the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Mrs. John Doe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “This is a rare spy thriller, smart, beautifully written, and stay-up-all-night enjoyable!”&lt;b&gt;—Gayle Lynds, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Assassins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “It isn’t easy to blindside a fellow suspense author, but Tom Savage manages to fool me every time. A clever, compelling, and cinematic page-turner in which nothing is as it seems, &lt;i&gt;Mrs. John Doe&lt;/i&gt; opens with a twist I didn’t see coming and closes with a satisfying bang. This longtime Savage fan ranks &lt;i&gt;Mrs. John Doe&lt;/i&gt; right up there with &lt;i&gt;Precipice&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;b&gt;—Wendy Corsi Staub, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Black Widow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Tom Savage’s &lt;i&gt;Mrs. John Doe&lt;/i&gt; races a fictional path somewhere between Alfred Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, a modern heroine-on-the-run spy thriller dealing with some of our time’s deadliest challenges.”&lt;b&gt;—James Grady, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Last Days of the Condor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Tom Savage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Savage knows the mystery novel inside and out, and it shows on every page.”&lt;b&gt;—James Patterson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “A master of the high-speed thriller.”&lt;b&gt;—Michael Connelly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “A very gifted writer who creates living, breathing characters, wonderful dialogue, and mesmerizing tension.”&lt;b&gt;—Nelson DeMille&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Savage writes with fierce energy, piercing holes in the shredding fabric of our society, where no one is safe, no one is free from harm.”&lt;b&gt;—Lorenzo Carcaterra&lt;/b&gt;</description>

So when she cracks open a window and climbs into his life—dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge—he follows. After their all-nighter ends, and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues—and they're for him.

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt;, the stunning debut novel from Kimberly McCreight, Kate's in the middle of the biggest meeting of her career when she gets the telephone call from Grace Hall, her daughter’s exclusive private school in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Amelia has been suspended, effective immediately, and Kate must come get her daughter—now. But Kate’s stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance. By then it’s already too late for Amelia. And for Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An academic overachiever despondent over getting caught cheating has jumped to her death. At least that’s the story Grace Hall tells Kate. And clouded as she is by her guilt and grief, it is the one she forces herself to believe. Until she gets an anonymous text: She didn’t jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; is about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it’s the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn’t save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Gillian Flynn's &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; will find &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; just as gripping and surprising.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Anonymous Make History&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the United States faces unprecedented levels of gun violence. Massacres are taking place in communities on a regular basis. In schools, lockdown drills are now as commonplace as fire drills. Politicians on Capitol Hill, impotent in the face of one of the most influential lobbying powers, have failed to pass gun legislation since 1994. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mac Ambrose, a twenty-year, international veteran of the CIA, is recruited by her closest friends to run a domestic operation: bring down the gun lobby by any means necessary so the Senate can pass a new assault weapons ban. In four weeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​From the hearing rooms of Capitol Hill, to the rolling hills of Kentucky and the wealthy suburbs of New Orleans, Mac flawlessly sets the traps of a multi-pronged strategy to ensnare a lawmaker, a lobbyist and a gun manufacturer. From a safe house in Philadelphia, she rediscovers relationships forsaken in the name of national security.</description>

  <description>New York City, 1976. Meet Regan and William Hamilton-Sweeney, estranged heirs to one of the city's great fortunes; Keith and Mercer, the men who, for better or worse, love them; Charlie and Samantha, two suburban teenagers seduced by downtown's punk scene; an obsessive magazine reporter, Richard, and his idealistic neighbor, Jenny, - and the detective trying to figure out what any of them have to do with a shooting in Central Park on New Year's Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mystery, as it reverberates through families, friendships, and the corridors of power, will open up even the loneliest-seeming corners of the crowded city. And when the blackout of July 13, 1977, plunges this world into darkness, each of these lives with be changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;City on Fire&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable novel about love and betrayal and forgiveness, about art and truth and rock 'n' roll, about what people need from each other in order to live... and about what makes the living worth doing in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dog· tol· o· gy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;noun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. The belief in Dog.&lt;br /&gt; 2. The system of rituals, practices, and behaviors engaged in by Dogtologists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chew on this.&lt;/b&gt; As humans, we have a deep need to believe . . . a need to relate to something greater and more ideal than ourselves. Perhaps that’s why so many millions believe in Dog. Man’s devotion to Dog has come to rival the great -isms and -ologies of the world. This has gone way beyond a hobby. We may not literally worship Dogs, but we come &lt;i&gt;pawfully &lt;/i&gt;close. This rabid reverence for Rover has a name: It’s called &lt;i&gt;Dogtology&lt;/i&gt;. Dogtology is for the dog lover who has bailed on a date because they didn’t want Twinkles to be left home alone, for the human whose dog owns a more festive holiday wardrobe than they do, those whose pups dine on free-range bison burgers while they live off ramen, or whose smartphones have more photos of their dog than of the humans in their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Live. Bark. Believe. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dogtology&lt;/i&gt; is a humorous exploration of man’s fanatical devotion to Dog. In this book, Lazarus makes the case that Dogtology has become a bone-a-fide belief system on par with the world’s great philosophies and religions. </description>

  <description>A play, set in 1940, about brothers James and Charles living through the war in two completely different ways. Which means more, family or pride? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Whilst their families back home suffer through the Blitz, five young &lt;br /&gt;soldiers are forced to kit up and set off on what could be the mission of their lives, or the only mission of their lives. Not knowing who gave the orders or where they have been sent, should they travel thousands of miles and risk their lives just to take their chance of living up to the highest of ranks, or is it more than that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Kira L Curtis</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Imagine losing a loved one in the public eye.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A media frenzy ensues and spreads your family name through the news. Reporters ambush you, and across the country, strangers gossip about your personal loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the circus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one understands better than Kim Goldman the complex emotions of individuals suffering a personal tragedy under the relentless gaze of the media. During the famed O.J. Simpson trial, Kim, whose brother, Ron Goldman, was brutally murdered, became the public poster child for victims suffering in the public eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Media Circus&lt;/i&gt;, Goldman, now a dedicated victims’ advocate who works with families across the country, presents the first collective look at these ordinary, grieving victims—forced to manage their very private trauma and despair in a very public way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through candid interviews and detailed, original reporting, &lt;i&gt;Media Circus&lt;/i&gt; delivers riveting, humanizing, and inspiring stories from the victims and survivors of violent crimes who found themselves the focus of national media attention. Its heartfelt narratives showcase the unique challenges of coping with and healing from grief when the whole world is watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these pages, the families of other victims tell their stories, including:&lt;br /&gt;Esaw And Emerald Garner, wife and daughter of police brutality victim Eric Garner (2014)&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett Lewis, mother of six-year-old Newtown tragedy victim Jesse Lewis (2012)&lt;br /&gt;Debra Tate, sister of Charles Manson murder victim Sharon Tate (1969)&lt;br /&gt;Judy Shepard, mother of gay hate-crime victim Matthew Shepard (1998)&lt;br /&gt;Mildred Muhammad, ex-wife of the DC Sniper (2002)&lt;br /&gt;Tere Duperrault Fassbender, survivor of family’s brutal murder at sea (1961)&lt;br /&gt;Collene Campbell, sister of murdered NASCAR driver Mickey Thompson (1988)&lt;br /&gt;Marie Monville, wife of the Amish Shooter (2006)&lt;br /&gt;Dave And Mary Neese, parents of teen murder victim Skylar Neese (2012)&lt;br /&gt;Scott And Kathleen Larimer, parents of Aurora theater shooting victim John Larimer, and&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Wygal, mother of Aurora theater shooting victim Rebecca Wingo (2012)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Media Circus&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond the names and faces to show the real victims behind the stories.</description>

  <description>In this beautiful, haunting debut, a boy is whisked away to the country in the wake of a scandal, and finds a captivating creature in the attic whose attention comes at a sinister price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Tell the story to its end," says Eren with a grin.&lt;br /&gt;His yellow eyes are glowing like embers in the night.&lt;br /&gt;"When I reach the end," I say, "what happens? You'll have the whole story."&lt;br /&gt;"Hmm," he says, looking at me and licking his lips with a dry, grey tongue. "What happens then? Why don't we find out?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are keeping secrets from Oli. His mum has brought him to stay with his aunt and uncle in the countryside, but nobody will tell him why his dad where his father is. Why isn't he with them? Has something happened? Oli has a hundred questions, and only an old, empty house in the middle of an ancient forest for answers. But then he finds a secret of his own: there is a creature that lives in the attic…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eren is not human.&lt;br /&gt;Eren is hungry for stories.&lt;br /&gt;Eren has been waiting for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing his stories with Eren, Oli starts to make sense of what’s happening downstairs with his family. But what if it’s a trap? Soon, Oli must make a choice: learn the truth—or abandon himself to Eren’s world, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminiscent of SKELLIG by David Almond and A MONSTER CALLS by Patrick Ness, EREN is richly atmospheric, moving, unsettleing, and told in gorgeous prose. A modern classic in the making.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At the heart of The Husband’s Secret is a letter that’s not meant to be read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My darling Cecilia, if you’re reading this, then I’ve died...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret—something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all—she’s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia—or each other—but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband’s secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses—and, ultimately, ourselves.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? &lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>A year after one of their identical twin daughters, Lydia, dies in an accident, Angus and Sarah Moorcraft move to the tiny Scottish island Angus inherited from his grandmother, hoping to put together the pieces of their shattered lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their surviving daughter, Kirstie, claims they have mistaken her identity—that she, in fact, is Lydia—their world comes crashing down once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As winter encroaches, Angus is forced to travel away from the island for work, Sarah is feeling isolated, and Kirstie (or is it Lydia?) is growing more disturbed. When a violent storm leaves Sarah and her daughter stranded, Sarah finds herself tortured by the past—what really happened on that fateful day one of her daughters died?</description>

  <description>In this free Rizzoli &amp;amp; Isles short story from New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen, author of The Silent Girl, a bizarre death comes with a supernatural twist. Homicide cop Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles have seen their fair share of mortal crimes, but the death of Kimberly Rayner may qualify as inhuman in more ways than one. When corpse of the emaciated seventeen-year-old girl is discovered next to an empty coffin in an abandoned church, mysterious bruises around the throat suggest foul play. Caught fleeing the scene is the victim's closest friend, Lucas Henry, an equally skeletal, pale teenager who claims he's guilty only of having a taste for blood-a craving he shared with Kimberly. But the victim's distraught father doesn't believe in vampires, only vengeance. And now, another life may be at risk unless Rizzoli and Isles can uncover the astonishing truth.</description>

  <description>With her acclaimed novels &lt;i&gt;Harvest&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Life Support,&lt;/i&gt; Tess Gerritsen has injected a powerful dose of adrenaline into the medical thriller. Now, in a new blockbuster, Gerritsen melds page-turning suspense with chilling realism as a small-town doctor races to unravel the roots of a violent outbreak -- before it destroys everything she loves. &lt;br /&gt; Lapped by he gentle waters of Locust Lake, the small resort town of Tranquility, Maine, seems like the perfect spot for Dr. Claire Elliot to shelter her adolescent son, Noah, from the distractions of the big city and the lingering memory of his father's death. But with the first snap of winter comes shocking news that puts her practise on the line: a teenage boy under her care has committed an appalling act of violence. And as Claire and all of Tranquility soon discover, it is just the start of a chain of lethal outbursts among the town's teenagers. &lt;br /&gt; As the rash of disturbing behavior grows, Claire uncovers a horrifying secret: this is not the first time it has happened. Twice a century,the children of Tranquility lash out with deadly violence. Claire suspects that there is a biological cause for the epidemic, and she fears that the placid Locust Lake may conceal an insidious danger. As she races to save Tranquility -- and her son -- from harm, Claire discovers an even greater threat: a shocking conspiracy to manipulate nature, and turn innocents to slaughter.</description>

  <description>Present day: Julia Hamill has made a horrifying discovery on the grounds of her new home in rural Massachusetts: a skull buried in the rocky soil–human, female, and, according to the trained eye of Boston medical examiner Maura Isles, scarred with the unmistakable marks of murder. But whoever this nameless woman was, and whatever befell her, is knowledge lost to another time. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston, 1830: In order to pay for his education, Norris Marshall, a talented but penniless student at Boston Medical College, has joined the ranks of local “resurrectionists”–those who plunder graveyards and harvest the dead for sale on the black market. Yet even this ghoulish commerce pales beside the shocking murder of a nurse found mutilated on the university hospital grounds. And when a distinguished doctor meets the same grisly fate, Norris finds that trafficking in the illicit cadaver trade has made him a prime suspect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove his innocence, Norris must track down the only witness to have glimpsed the killer: Rose Connolly, a beautiful seamstress from the Boston slums who fears she may be the next victim. Joined by a sardonic, keenly intelligent young man named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Norris and Rose comb the city–from its grim cemeteries and autopsy suites to its glittering mansions and centers of Brahmin power–on the trail of a maniacal fiend who lurks where least expected . . . and who waits for his next lethal opportunity.</description>

  <description>Every crime scene tells a story. Some keep you awake at night. Others haunt your dreams. The grisly display homicide cop Jane Rizzoli finds in Boston’s Chinatown will do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the murky shadows of an alley lies a female’s severed hand. On the tenement rooftop above is the corpse belonging to that hand, a red-haired woman dressed all in black, her head nearly severed. Two strands of silver hair—not human—cling to her body. They are Rizzoli’s only clues, but they’re enough for her and medical examiner Maura Isles to make the startling discovery: that this violent death had a chilling prequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteen years earlier, a horrifying murder-suicide in a Chinatown restaurant left five people dead. But one woman connected to that massacre is still alive: a mysterious martial arts master who knows a secret she dares not tell, a secret that lives and breathes in the shadows of Chinatown. A secret that may not even be human. Now she’s the target of someone, or something, deeply and relentlessly evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cracking a crime resonating with bone-chilling echoes of an ancient Chinese legend, Rizzoli and Isles must outwit an unseen enemy with centuries of cunning—and a swift, avenging blade.</description>

  <description>In Wyoming for a medical conference, Boston medical examiner Maura Isles joins a group of friends on a spur-of-the-moment ski trip. But when their SUV stalls on a snow-choked mountain road, they're stranded with no help in sight.&lt;br /&gt;As night falls, the group seeks refuge from the blizzard in the remote village of Kingdom Come, where twelve eerily identical houses stand dark and abandoned. Something terrible has happened in Kingdom Come: Meals sit untouched on tables, cars are still parked in garages. The town's previous residents seem to have vanished into thin air, but footprints in the snow betray the presence of someone who still lurks in the cold darkness--someone who is watching Maura and her friends. &lt;br /&gt;Days later, Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli receives the grim news that Maura's charred body has been found in a mountain ravine. Shocked and grieving, Jane is determined to learn what happened to her friend. The investigation plunges Jane into the twisted history of Kingdom Come, where a gruesome discovery lies buried beneath the snow. As horrifying revelations come to light, Jane closes in on an enemy both powerful and merciless--and the chilling truth about Maura's fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published in the UK as THE KILLING PLACE.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A blessed event becomes a nightmare for pregnant homicide detective Jane Rizzoli when she finds herself on the wrong side of a hostage crisis in this timely and relentless thriller from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Body Double&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A nameless, beautiful woman appears to be just another corpse in the morgue. An apparent suicide, she lies on a gurney, awaiting the dissecting scalpel of medical examiner Maura Isles. But when Maura unzips the body bag and looks down at the body, she gets the fright of her life. The corpse opens its eyes. &lt;br /&gt; Very much alive, the woman is rushed to the hospital, where with shockingly cool precision, she murders a security guard and seizes hostages . . . one of them a pregnant patient, Jane Rizzoli. &lt;br /&gt; Who is this violent, desperate soul, and what does she want? As the tense hours tick by, Maura joins forces with Jane s husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, to track down the mysterious killer s identity. When federal agents suddenly appear on the scene, Maura and Gabriel realize that they are dealing with a case that goes far deeper than just an ordinary hostage crisis. &lt;br /&gt; Only Jane, trapped with the armed madwoman, holds the key to the mystery. And only she can solve it if she survives the night. &lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;"</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Daunted by the singular sexual tastes and dark secrets of the beautiful, tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a Seattle publishing house. But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven, and demanding Fifty Shades. While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront her anger and envy of the women who came before her and make the most important decision of her life. Erotic, sparkling and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades Darker&lt;/i&gt; is the irresistibly addictive second part of the Fifty Shades trilogy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;See the world of &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; anew through the eyes of Christian Grey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Christian's own words, and through his thoughts, reflections, and dreams, E L James offers a fresh perspective on the love story that has enthralled millions of readers around the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian Grey exercises control in all things; his world is neat, disciplined, and utterly empty—until the day that Anastasia Steele falls into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown hair. He tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he cannot comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy, unworldly Ana seems to see right through him—past the business prodigy and the penthouse lifestyle to Christian’s cold, wounded heart.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will being with Ana dispel the horrors of his childhood that haunt Christian every night? Or will his dark sexual desires, his compulsion to control, and the self-loathing that fills his soul drive this girl away and destroy the fragile hope she offers him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;My name is Nicky Frank. Except, most likely, it isn’t. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nicole Frank shouldn’t have been able to survive the car accident, much less crawl up the steep ravine. Not in the dark, not in the rain, not with her injuries. But one thought allows her to defy the odds and flag down help: Vero.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;I’m looking for a little girl. I have to save her. Except, most likely, she doesn’t exist. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Sergeant Wyatt Foster is frustrated when even the search dogs can’t find any trace of the mysterious missing child. Until Nicky’s husband, Thomas, arrives with a host of shattering revelations: Nicole Frank suffers from a rare brain injury and the police shouldn’t trust anything she says.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;My husband claims he’ll do anything to save me. Except, most likely, he can’t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Who is Nicky Frank, and what happened the night her car sailed off the road? Was it a random accident or something more sinister given the woman’s lack of family and no close friends? The deeper Wyatt digs, the more concerned he becomes. Because it turns out, in the past few months, Nicky has suffered from more than one close accident. . . . In fact, it would appear someone very much wants her dead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is my life. Except, most likely, it’s not. Now watch me crash and burn.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>What would you do if the man of your dreams hides the soul of a killer? &lt;br /&gt;Jim Beckett was everything she'd ever dreamed of...But two years after Tess married the decorated cop and bore his child, she helped put him behind bars for savagely murdering ten women. Even locked up in a maximum security prison, he vowed he would come after her and make her pay. Now the cunning killer has escaped--and the most dangerous game of all begins.... &lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of fear, Tess will do something she's never done before. She's going to learn to protect her daughter and fight back, with the help of a burned-out ex-marine. As the largest manhunt four states have ever seen mobilizes to catch Beckett, the clock winds down to the terrifying reunion between husband and wife. And Tess knows that this time, her only choices are to kill--or be killed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>Not even the icy temperatures of a typical New England winter can match the bone-chilling scene of carnage discovered at the chapel of Our Lady of Divine Light. Within the cloistered convent lie two nuns–one dead, one critically injured–victims of an unspeakably savage attacker. The brutal crime appears to be without motive, but medical examiner Maura Isles’s autopsy of the dead woman yields a shocking surprise: Twenty-year-old Sister Camille gave birth before she was murdered. Then another body is found, mutilated beyond recognition. Together, Isles and homicide detective Jane Rizzoli uncover an ancient horror that connects these terrible slaughters. As long-buried secrets come to light, Maura Isles finds herself drawn inexorably toward the heart of an investigation that strikes close to home–and toward a dawning revelation about the killer’s identity too shattering to consider.</description>

  <description>A small Georgia town erupts in panic when a young college professor is found brutally mutilated in the local diner. But it's only when town pediatrician and coroner Sara Linton does the autopsy that the full extent of the killer's twisted work becomes clear. Sara's ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, leads the investigation -- a trail of terror that grows increasingly macabre when another local woman is found crucified a few days later. But he's got more than a sadistic serial killer on his hands, for the county's sole female detective, Lena Adams -- the first victim's sister -- wants to serve her own justice. But it is Sara who holds the key to finding the killer. A secret from her past could unmask the brilliantly malevolent psychopath .. or mean her death.</description>

  <description>For David Ransom, it begins as an open-and-shut case. Malpractice. As attorney for a grieving family, he's determined to hang a negligent doctor. Then Dr. Kate Chesne storms into his office, dating him to seek out the truth -- that she's being framed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it was Kate's career that was in jeopardy. Then, when another body is discovered, David begins to believe her. Suddenly, it's much more. Somewhere in the Honolulu hospital, a killer walks freely among patients and staff. And now David finds himself asking the same questions Kate is desperate to have answered. Who is next? And why?</description>

  <description>Boston medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles literally meets her match–and must face a savage serial killer and shattering personal revelations–in the brilliant new novel of suspense by the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;b&gt;The Surgeon&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;The Sinner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Maura Isles makes her living dealing with death. As a pathologist in a major metropolitan city, she has seen more than her share of corpses every day–many of them victims of violent murder. But never before has her blood run cold, and never has the grim expression “dead ringer” rung so terrifyingly true. Because never before has the lifeless body on the medical examiner’s table been her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there can be no denying the mind-reeling evidence before her shocked eyes and those of her colleagues, including Detective Jane Rizzoli: the woman found shot to death outside Maura’s home is the mirror image of Maura, down to the most intimate physical nuances. Even more chilling is the discovery that they share the same birth date and blood type. For the stunned Maura, an only child, there can be just one explanation. And when a DNA test confirms that Maura’s mysterious doppelgänger is in fact her twin sister, an already bizarre murder investigation becomes a disturbing and dangerous excursion into a past full of dark secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for answers, Maura is drawn to a seaside town in Maine where other horrifying surprises await. But perhaps more frightening, an unknown murderer is at large on a cross-country killing spree. To stop the massacre and uncover the twisted truth about her own roots, Maura must probe her first living subject: the mother that she never knew . . . an icy and cunning woman who could be responsible for giving Maura life–and who just may have a plan to take it away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Surgeon&lt;/i&gt; returns, and so does that chilling novel's diabolical villain. Though held behind bars, Warren Hoyt still haunts a helpless city, seeming to bequeath his evil legacy to a student all-too-diligent . . . and all-too-deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE APPRENTICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It is a boiling hot Boston summer. Adding to the city's woes is a series of shocking crimes, in which wealthy men are made to watch while their wives are brutalized. A sadistic demand that ends in abduction and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pattern suggests one man: serial killer Warren Hoyt, recently removed from the city's streets. Police can only assume an acolyte is at large, a maniac basing his attacks on the twisted medical techniques of the madman he so admires. At least that's what Detective Jane Rizzoli thinks. Forced again to confront the killer who scarred her - literally and figuratively - she is determined to finally end Hoyt's awful influence . . . even if it means receiving more resistance from her all-male homicide squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rizzoli isn't counting on the U.S. government's sudden interest. Or on meeting Special Agent Gabriel Dean, who knows more than he will tell. Most of all, she isn't counting on becoming a target herself, once Hoyt is suddenly free, joining his mysterious blood brother in a vicious vendetta. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with superbly created characters and the medical and police procedural details that are her trademark,&lt;i&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/i&gt; is Tess Gerritsen at her brilliant best. Set in a stunning world where evil is easy to learn and hard to end, this is a thriller by a master who could teach other authors a thing or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Willow is born with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, her parents are devastated--she will suffer hundreds of broken bones as she grows, a lifetime of pain. Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of "luckier" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it's all worth it because Willow is, funny as it seems, perfect. She's smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes, though, after a series of events forces Charlotte and her husband to confront the most serious what-ifs of all. What if Charlotte had known earlier of Willow's illness? What if things could have been different? What if their beloved Willow had never been born? To do Willow justice, Charlotte must ask herself these questions and one more. What constitutes a valuable life?</description>

  <description>For eighteen years the Hartes and the Golds have lived next door to each other, sharing everything from Chinese food to chicken pox to carpool duty—they've grown so close it seems they have always been a part of each other's lives. Parents and children alike have been best friends, so it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. They've been soul mates since they were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the appalling truth: Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head. There's a single unspent bullet in the gun that Chris took from his father's cabinet—a bullet that Chris tells police he intended for himself. But a local detective has doubts about the suicide pact that Chris has described.</description>

  <description>After a shootout claims the life of his partner in a condemned tenement building on Pearl Street, Detective John Tallow unwittingly stumbles across an apartment stacked high with guns. When examined, each weapon leads to a different, previously unsolved murder. Someone has been killing people for twenty years or more and storing the weapons together for some inexplicable purpose. Confronted with the sudden emergence of hundreds of unsolved homicides, Tallow soon discovers that he's walked into a veritable deal with the devil. An unholy bargain that has made possible the rise of some of Manhattan's most prominent captains of industry. A hunter who performs his deadly acts as a sacrifice to the old gods of Manhattan, who may, quite simply, be the most prolific murderer in New York City's history.</description>

  <description>Burned-out private detective and self-styled shit magnet Michael McGill needed a wake-up call to jump-start his dead career. What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this "Secret Constitution" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the "good old days." Like Vonnegut, Orwell, and Huxley before him, Warren Ellis deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the "moral majority" by giving us a glimpse at the monstrous outcome that their overzealous policies would achieve.</description>

      <![CDATA[From the very first sentence you know this book isn't your average. It's quirky, fun and clever. I would highly recommend this book and other Warren Ellis novels as he has such a unique writing style and writes about things you wouldn't even imagine!]]>

  <description>The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, &lt;i&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt; has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>From #1 "New York Times" bestselling author Sylvia Day comes the provocative masterstroke of abandon and obsession that redefined the meaning of desire and became a global phenomenon... &lt;br /&gt; "Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness."&lt;br /&gt; ""&lt;br /&gt; He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily &lt;br /&gt; Gideon "knew." He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each others most private wounds and desires. &lt;br /&gt; The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart "</description>

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IN BOSTON, THERE'S A KILLER ON THE LOOSE...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A killer who targets lone women, who breaks into their apartments and performs terrifying ritualistic acts of torture on them before finishing them off. His surgical skills lead police to suspect he is a physician - a physician who, instead of saving lives, takes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as homicide detective Thomas Moore and his partner Jane Rizzoli begin their investigation, they make a startling discovery. Closely linked to these killings is Catherine Cordell, a beautiful doctor with a mysterious past.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, &lt;i&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A novel about holding on, letting go, and learning to love again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in paperback, the endearing novel that captured readers' hearts and introduced a fresh new voice in women's fiction Cecelia Ahern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holly couldn't live without her husband Gerry, until the day she had to. They were the kind of young couple who could finish each other's sentences. When Gerry succumbs to a terminal illness and dies, 30-year-old Holly is set adrift, unable to pick up the pieces. But with the help of a series of letters her husband left her before he died and a little nudging from an eccentric assortment of family and friends, she learns to laugh, overcome her fears, and discover a world she never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The kind of enchanting novel with cross-generational appeal that comes along once in a great while, &lt;i&gt;PS, I Love You&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating love letter to the world!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>L.A. shoe designer Maddie Springer hasn't seen her father since he reportedly ran off to Las Vegas with a showgirl named Lola. So she's shocked when he leaves a desperate plea for help on her answering machine - ending in a loud bang. Gunshot? Car backfire? Never one to leave her curiosity unsatisfied, Maddie straps on her stilettos and, along with her trigger-happy best friend, makes tracks for Sin City in search of her MIA dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie hits the jackpot, all right. She finds not only her dad, but also a handful of aging drag queens, an organized crime ring smuggling fake Prada pumps, and one relentless killer. Plus, it seems the LAPD's sexiest cop is doing a little Vegas moonlighting of his own. In a town where odds are everything, Maddie bets it all on her ability to out-step a vicious murderer. She just hopes her gamble pays off... before her own luck runs out.</description>

  <description>You've lost your job as a department store lingerie buyer, your car's been repossessed, and most of your furniture and small appliances have been sold off to pay last month's rent. Now the rent is due again. And you live in New Jersey. What do you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're Stephanie Plum, you become a bounty hunter. But not just a nickel-and-dime bounty hunter; you go after the big money. That means a cop gone bad. And not just any cop. She goes after Joe Morelli, a disgraced former vice cop who is also the man who took Stephanie's virginity at age 16 and then wrote details on a bathroom wall. With pride and rent money on the line, Plum plunges headlong into her first case, one that pits her against ruthless adversaries - people who'd rather kill than lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Stephanie Plum, Evanovich has created a resourceful and humorous character who stands apart from the pack of gritty female detectives.</description>
