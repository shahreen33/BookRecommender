  <description>I didn’t mean to see him naked--it was an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had to be, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Noah McCormick and I have never been anything more than friends. In all the years I’ve known him, he’s never once laid a finger on me. And even though he was a cute lifeguard at 16 and a hotter-than-hell sheriff’s deputy at 34, he's always been that protective guy I could trust to keep his hands to himself. I never wanted to mess with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I walked in on him getting out of the shower and saw his hard, muscular body totally bare and dripping wet. At that moment I never wanted to mess with anything so badly in my entire life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have covered my eyes. Said I was sorry. At the very least, I could have handed him a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, I was only in town for a few days, and he was just doing me a favor by escorting me to my sister’s wedding. It wasn’t a real date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t apologize. And he didn’t cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Talk about a hot mess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all those years of being just friends, suddenly we’re insatiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s made it clear he’s not interested in romance. Which is fine with me because I’ve got a plane ticket back to my real life at the end of the week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s all in fun...or is it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Protecting her is his job…falling for her is unexpected.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carter Sharp…isn’t always, especially when he’s in the presence of his sister’s friend, Mel. The sexy tattoo artist’s spontaneous, reckless attitude clashes with his ‘by-the-book, never-cut-corners’ creed—the one that saved his and his team’s lives on more than one occasion. His D-Force days are over but working for one of his former Delta brothers as a security expert/investigator has just begun, and it’s just his luck to land an assignment to secretly protect the artist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mel Richardson doesn’t want or need a man in her life—for his safety. She couldn’t save her father or her brother, so she refuses to let there be a third. But it’s totally safe to secretly crush on her friend’s older brother, and even harbor a fantasy or two of the hot, former military guy. Turning a blemish into a work of art, plus rehoming animals who survive the death of their owners are both emotionally rewarding and the perfect distractions to her growing attraction to Carter. Too bad his sister volunteers him to help Mel with some recent technical difficulties. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The hot woman is strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he’s secretly assigned to protect her, but it’s the soft, vulnerable side he discovers underneath her tough persona that terrifies him. It makes her lethal enough to cut through his defenses and melt his cold heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s too sassy…he’s too alpha…but sometimes fate provides what you need, not what you want.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Awarded a medal for a mission that almost turned disastrous by betrayal, Levi “Mac” McCall leaves Delta Force and his poor judgement behind. Determined to move on, he gives 110% to his new investigation company…except whenever his brother’s sexy sister-in-law is near. The sassy woman followed him from central Texas and is a distraction Mac doesn’t want. So why the hell can’t he get the hot kiss they shared out of his head? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stefanie Davis did NOT follow that stubborn wall of muscles to Harland County. She relocated because of work, and thanks to endorsements from his father and his cousin, she has enough clientele to open her own graphic arts business. Too bad it’s near the sexy as hell security expert whose kiss is as amazing as it is dangerous…to her own good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before long, their off-the-charts chemistry leads to more embraces than arguments and has Mac considering a new mission: Prove to Stefanie that sass and alpha are a perfect match.</description>

  <description>Oliver Ice, one of Boston University’s notorious hockey players, has been on my radar since I slammed into his rock-hard body during my first week of college, three years ago. He helped me to my feet, muttered an apology, and ran off after his girlfriend, dashing my hopes of a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s the bartender where I work, and this time, very much single. Night after night I watch the tall, broad, and sexy right winger mixing drinks and being Mr. Personality, while I remind myself how horribly my last relationship ended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Oliver overhears a private conversation, he offers to be the one thing I need more than anything--my pretend boyfriend at a dreaded family reunion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One weekend was all it was meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do I protect my fragile heart when the lines between fantasy and reality blur with our first kiss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;ICED can be read as a standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Reese&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting ditched at the altar is nothing compared to being humiliated there in front of three hundred shocked guests. Apparently I’m no good at spotting the signs your man’s a cheating liar. So I set off solo on my honeymoon to Hawaii, where I realize I’ve got this life thing down just fine on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friendships and laughter? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adventures? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relationships? Hell no. Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a man of few words. My reputation as a moody prick is deserved, but only the handful of people who really know me see the man beneath the professional mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a protector. A warrior. That part is true. But the world doesn’t get to see the rest of me. And women don’t seem to mind my gruff exterior—my bed’s always warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m content with life—loving it, even—or so I thought. But when I meet a beautiful pastry chef with a broken heart and a smile that softens me down to my soul, I realize I wasn’t really content at all before her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had the words to let her know.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A best friends-to-lovers, stand-alone romance from New York Times Bestselling Author, A.L. Jackson . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan Bryant wasn't your typical hero.&lt;br /&gt;But he was mine.&lt;br /&gt;Broken by the worlds' standards, he was still the strongest boy I would ever know.&lt;br /&gt;My best friend. The boy I'd given everything to. My heart, my body, and the promise of forever.&lt;br /&gt;The day I'd needed him most, he walked away.&lt;br /&gt;He left me shattered and questioning the love I'd thought we'd shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, I wasn't prepared for him to return to Gingham Lakes.&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn't have mattered if he wasn't the most beautiful man I'd ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;My fingers still would have ached to caress his skin.&lt;br /&gt;My body still would have begged to get lost in his touch.&lt;br /&gt;And my heart . . . it would have always sung his name.&lt;br /&gt;But time changes things. With it, secrets that could ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;Can we find a way to love again, or have the fears of our past stolen the hope of our forever . . .</description>

  <description>Every family has a black sheep – even the royal ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the royal family of Denmark, that black sheep is me. To the public I’m known as Princess Stella, but I feel anything but royal. As a single mom, divorcee, social outcast, and forever forgotten about under the magnetism and power of my older brother, King Aksel, I’m used to being an outlier. Though it doesn’t matter when my whip-smart nine-year old daughter, Anya, is my whole world anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then that world of mine gets turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I meet Prince Orlando of Monaco, whom the media has dubbed “The Royal Rogue” for many good reasons. I can’t stand that arrogant smirk on his face, the lewd words that leave his lips – pretty much everything about him. I especially can’t stand how infuriatingly sexy he is and how he manages to get under my skin like no one else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a long time since a man could make me feel that way, so you can’t really blame me for throwing my willpower out the window and succumbing to a brief but torrid affair with him, full of hot, dirty sex and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until that nothing else turns into something more, in the form of a big surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I got that wicked royal rogue out of my system but there’s a link between us now that neither of us can ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The Royal Rogue is the 4th book in the Nordic Royals series but can be read as a standalone**</description>

  <description>I was naïve to think my marriage to Luka Catano might work.&lt;br /&gt;I was infatuated with him from afar…&lt;br /&gt;Until I met him.&lt;br /&gt;He loved the challenge of his next conquest, anyone would do...&lt;br /&gt;Except me.&lt;br /&gt;A wife was never something he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torturous was not a strong enough word to describe how I felt when I was in a room with Luka. Besides hating nearly every word that came out of his mouth, I also drowned with lust every time I looked at him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times I thought he might feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing prepared me for what his family would make me become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*There will be four books in the Kingdoms of Sin series. Each book can be read as a standalone though there are interconnecting characters.*</description>

  <description>A badass biker and the sexy little sprite that wants nothing to do with him. &lt;br /&gt;They’re opposites in every way that matters—except one—they can’t keep their eyes off each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer watches Tink strut past him without so much as a glance. His eyes moving over her hot little body—a body that’s been driving him crazy and keeping him awake at night. She’s the one chick he’s been infatuated with for months, but she won’t give him the time of day. &lt;br /&gt;Hammer just doesn’t get it. After all, he’s a big, muscular man who turns female heads wherever he goes. Tattoos cover the skin of his sculpted body, and that combined with being a patched member of the Evil Dead MC does it for most women who are into bad boys. Not Tink, though. Unfortunately for Hammer, the one woman he wants more than any other seems to be immune to him. &lt;br /&gt;Well, he’s had about enough of her snubbing him like he doesn’t even exist. He’s going after what he wants, and what he wants more than anything is that hot little girl with the short white-blonde hair. The one so petite, the guys in the club nicknamed her Tinker Bell. &lt;br /&gt;Yes, that sexy little sprite is going to be his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tink is totally aware of Hammer’s eyes on her as she walks past. Warmth floods her body, like it does every time she’s near him and he looks at her that way—like he’s undressing her with his eyes and imagining all the sordid things he’d like to do to her. Things she lies awake at night imagining as well. &lt;br /&gt;But Tink isn’t willing to risk her heart; not for a man who could hurt her like he could, a man who has already been with her sister. Raven always gets what she wants, and that’s usually anything she thinks Tink might want. &lt;br /&gt;Tink learned long ago not to even try to compete with her sister. It’s pointless. So, she’s carved out a life for herself surrounded by the men of this MC and the women who have become her best friends. It’s a world she thought her sister would never be interested in, and one where she’ll never have to compete with her. &lt;br /&gt;Apparently, she’d thought wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when a badass biker wants the one woman he can’t have? &lt;br /&gt;How far will he go to have her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About Nicole James &lt;br /&gt;Nicole James is a USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling author who loves writing about hot alpha men who'll do anything for the women they love! Her stories are filled with struggle, conflict and real human emotion. She is the author of the Evil Dead MC series, the Brothers Ink Tattoo series and more. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>TRAUMA HAS A WAY OF LEAVING ITS MARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took years to do it, but I can finally look in a mirror&lt;br /&gt;and see more than just the scars.&lt;br /&gt;If only that were true for the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whispers, the stares, the pity, they’re familiar now.&lt;br /&gt;Except his eyes don’t linger, his demeanor never changes.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that’s why I trust him&lt;br /&gt;and take the leap to move in with a virtual stranger.&lt;br /&gt;A stranger who might be more scarred than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YET NOT ALL SCARS ARE LEFT ON THE SURFACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I got a spot at Sailor’s Grave Tattoo Parlor, I had everything.&lt;br /&gt;A roof over my head, an honest living, a few friends.&lt;br /&gt;The times when I went without no longer factored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she comes into my life.&lt;br /&gt;Until I offer her a place to stay.&lt;br /&gt;Until she draws me in with that blinding light inside her,&lt;br /&gt;and almost makes me forget&lt;br /&gt;to keep the past in the dark where it belongs.</description>

  <description>I left Lakeside, Montana heartbroken and lost with no desire to ever return.&lt;br /&gt;But life had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;Moving back wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I’d do anything for my daughter Emmy. Including put myself right in the path of Sadie Jones.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter’s new dance teacher.&lt;br /&gt;The reason my heart was never fully opened to anyone else was because it’s always belonged to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I watched Reed Sanders drive away from Lakeside, I knew my heart would never recover.&lt;br /&gt;He was meant for more than what this town could offer him.&lt;br /&gt;Than what I could offer him.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to warn him to stay away from me but he refused to listen.&lt;br /&gt;If only he would have, maybe then I wouldn’t feel so broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart is mysterious. It can be closed off and open at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, sometimes it takes danger lurking around the corner to make it choose a side.&lt;br /&gt;All I can hope is that one day I can finally hear the words… I’m Yours.</description>

  <description>The first time I met Alexander Harding, I yelled at him for taking my parking spot. Rich and powerful, I saw him as nothing more than my new coldhearted boss. I hated him once but now…now things aren’t that simple. There’s a man beneath the beast, and the more I get to know him, the more I fall in love with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though just as I’m able to envision a future together, the past comes back to haunt us both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six years ago, my life changed forever when I found out I was pregnant. The last thing I expected was to see Michael Cooper again, but now he’s here and is ready to make up for lost time. He wants to be involved in his daughters’ life. My life. And it’s making me question everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never thought it was possible to be in love with two men at the same time. One from my past, and one I want in my future. My heart is completely torn in two, with each half going in a different direction. I’d give them each half if I could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then I would be left with nothing.</description>

  <description>The first in an all new stand-alone trilogy set in Kristen Proby's Big Sky world, Enchanting Sebastian will take your breath away! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Turning thirty-five doesn’t mean much to most men. For Sebastian Wakefield, it’s the end of life as he knows it. &lt;br /&gt;When your father is the King of England, thirty-five is the year that a marriage will be arranged, a suitable bride cementing a future you didn’t choose. The obvious solution for escaping the archaic laws of the throne is for Sebastian to leave the country. And where better to go than America? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nina Wolfe has spent her career avoiding scandal. As a Hollywood publicist and minor celebrity in her own right, she knows exactly what it takes to keep the media at bay—and what will send them into a frenzy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian hiding out in Cunningham Falls, Montana is an unlikely story. Ending up in his bed, even more so. And keeping their arrangement out of the press might just be impossible. The ring on her finger is about to spark a firestorm that will change her life, and no professional spin will help Nina fit into the world of royalty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only love could write an enchanting new beginning—if they’ll let themselves fall. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Crossroads of Destiny and Desire.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s a hardcore biker who likes his women easy, his whiskey neat, and his Harley fast. Nothing complicated … until a pampered beauty collides into his world.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shadow is an &lt;b&gt;Insurgent&lt;/b&gt;, one of the &lt;b&gt;largest outlaw MCs&lt;/b&gt; in Colorado. Riding his Harley, hanging out with his fellow Insurgents, and enjoying the ladies, are his idea of the perfect life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He likes things simple and free from drama, and that includes his women. Privileged princesses? Definitely not. &lt;br /&gt;Then at his friend’s engagement party, he sees her. &lt;b&gt;Sexy, curves in all the right places, and a dangerous look in her dark green eyes.&lt;/b&gt; Oh yeah … his libido is starting to smoke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All he wants is one long taste. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scarlett Mansfield comes from one of the richest families in the county. Her life is perfect and well-orchestrated until she sets her eyes on &lt;b&gt;the chiseled biker across the room.&lt;/b&gt; The intensity of his gaze makes her blush … almost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows in her world the rugged stranger is taboo, but she is drawn to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has complication stamped all over her, but an undeniable desire sizzles between them, and Shadow can’t stay away. &lt;br /&gt;When they come together, sparks combust setting off a series of events that will forever change their destiny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Insurgents MC series are standalone romance novels. This is Shadow’s story. This book contains violence, abuse, strong language, and steamy/graphic sexual scenes. It describes the life and actions of an outlaw motorcycle club. HEA. No cliffhangers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He promised me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he boarded a plane for a college a thousand miles away and never returned. A decade later there’s a ring on my finger with a new promise from a new love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as my life falls into place, pretty as the pages of a magazine, my world is knocked over. The moment he touches me everything around me begins to crack, exposing all the lies I’ve told myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every glance reminds me. Every touch ignites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things aren’t how they used to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love isn’t easy.</description>

  <description>The last place Sophia Lancaster wanted to return to was Poplar Falls. It’s the place that holds all the painful memories and unanswered questions she’s ever had. One phone call causes her life to take a turn, forcing her back to the town she hasn’t stepped foot in over twenty years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And right into the path of Braxton Young. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His blue eyes, sinful smile, and rough exterior are no match for Sophia. She’s there for one reason, and it isn’t to fall in love. The sooner she can get out of this small town and back in New York City—the better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, fate doesn’t care for either of their desires. Instead, they’re forced to deal with each other, finding their differences aren’t as great as they thought. Each day brings them closer to friendship and the possibility of something more. The answers she seeks might not only break her and Braxton apart but also her heart.</description>

  <description>Sadie Slade was the love of my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left for college promising her I’d be back in four years. &lt;br /&gt;She stayed behind promising me she’d wait. &lt;br /&gt;We both broke our promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we bump into each other five years later my feelings for her come rushing to the surface. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want her back. &lt;br /&gt;She wants me gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How quickly my Sadie Girl has forgotten—I’ve never been the type of man who accepts defeat. &lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Daniels was my entire life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he wasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;Now he’s back and thinks we should pick up where we left off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the simplicity of what we had. &lt;br /&gt;I miss how easily we fit together. &lt;br /&gt;Truthfully…I miss him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I allow him to get too close, he’ll see I’m not the same girl he left behind five years ago. &lt;br /&gt;He thinks I’m upset about our break up. &lt;br /&gt;The truth is so much worse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could you love a man surrounded by danger?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigi Gallo’s childhood was filled with the roar of a motorcycle and the hum of a tattoo gun. Fresh out of college, she’s about to start working at her family’s tattoo studio — Inked. But when she shows up the first day, she never expects to run into someone tall, dark, and totally sexy from her not-so-innocent past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pike Moore is a bossy biker with a cocky attitude and an even bigger ego. He came to Inked to start over. New town. New job. New roots. None of that included coming face-to-face with the hot chick who spent a week in his bed before she vanished without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Pike’s dark family history catches up with him, can he stop Gigi from being caught in the crossfire?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame is book one in the Men of Inked: Heatwave series by USA Today bestselling author Chelle Bliss. The Men of Inked: Heatwave series features steamy romance, hot heroes, and strong women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**City &amp;amp; Suzy's Daughter**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; One protective alpha male plus one curvy damsel in distress equals an instant attraction they can’t deny. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Billionaire nightclub owner Jason Dare doesn’t stand a chance. From the moment he lays eyes on the luscious blonde stuck on the side of the road and realizes she’s in danger, he goes from playboy to bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faith Lancaster’s sweet body won’t come to any harm on his watch. And watch Faith he does. He can’t take his eyes off her. Jason will stop at nothing to keep Faith safe. Even if it means moving her into his apartment and letting her into his once private life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hiding from her past, Faith has spent the last year building her candy business into a profitable company while keeping to herself and staying under the radar … until she meets the delicious Mr. Dare. Alpha and irresistible, he awakens desires she has long denied. It doesn’t take her long to succumb to his charms and fall hard for the man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They both have their reasons for keeping things casual but when Faith’s past catches up with her, can Jason finally claim the woman meant to be his? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Sexy Series / Dare Standalone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Sexy Series: &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Sexy Dare - ASIN: B07T86138D &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Sexy Hers - ASIN: B07TCCL33N &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Sexy Mine - ASIN: B07TDBMNBP</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; I can't even imagine what I'd do with a man like him. He wants no part of a girl like me. So how come he can't stay away, and I can't stop thinking what if?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kayla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life isn't easy. Single mom, minimum wage, family drama. You know the story. I've come a long way in a short time, though, and it's all worth it. For Jimmy. My grumpy little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a hot biker charms his way into our lives, tempting me into wanting more. I want to go for it, but how can I trust myself when I've screwed up so badly in the past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm an easy kind of guy in a rough world. Yeah, I got a record, but I also got my club, my ride, and the open road. Life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't need no hassle, and from recent experience, woman is the very definition. I sure don't need to be messin' with a girl young enough to get carded, cartin' along a six-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is she livin' all up in my head? And how am I gonna stop my past from screwin' up this good thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charge&lt;/i&gt; is a 70,000-word, single mom, older man/younger woman, motorcycle club romance. It's got heart, heat, and a lil' dirt. This novel is intended for adult readers (18+) due to strong language, violence, possible triggers, and explicit intimate scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standalone. Safe. HEA.</description>

  <description>Holly Lane has spent her life under the crushing thumbs of her cop father and controlling mother. Now, well into her twenties, she’s finally getting a fresh start and moving into her own apartment. Breaking away from her parents should be easy, but how can Holly begrudge their overprotective nature when their other daughter was murdered by an outlaw biker years ago? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his brand-spankin’ new patch, Little Jack has a satisfying life in the Hell’s Handlers MC. Sure, the town’s new sheriff is messing with his club, but it’s nothing they can’t handle. Life only gets better when LJ’s dream woman walks out of his fantasies and into the vacant apartment next to his. Holly is sweet as sugar, curvy in ways that make LJ’s mouth water, and the woman can bake like no other. Personal demons keep LJ from chasing a long-term relationship with any woman, but that doesn’t mean he can’t have a little fun with his hot new neighbor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly is pretty sure life is finally on the right track when she meets LJ on her first day in town. Incredibly tall, bearded, tattooed, and strong enough to unload her car without breaking a sweat, her new neighbor just might be perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With outrageous chemistry and a genuine liking for each other, Holly and LJ seem destined for an explosive encounter until a tornado rolls through their budding relationship in the form of Holly’s father. As the new town sheriff, her father only has one item on his agenda: eliminate the Hell’s Handlers MC.</description>

  <description>Gage Ryan was a notorious heartbreaker, on screen and off. A confirmed bachelor, this world-famous actor dashed the hopes of millions of adoring fans when he rejected marriage and commitment: no wedding bells, no baby carriages. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He'd never had cause to consider the alternative, but that all changed the night he met rising star, Morgan Kelly. Too bad her first impression of him was less than favorable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although their attraction was instant and mutual, Morgan wasn't interested. Hollywood heartthrobs were trouble. Especially Gage, a man used to women who would do anything for his attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not happening. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Gage knew how to go after what he wanted, and his desire for Morgan was stronger than anything he'd ever felt before. Powerful enough to make him reconsider his previously held beliefs on love and longevity. He just had to convince her of how serious he was. It was a good thing he was ready for the chase.</description>

  <description>When all that you want, is all that’s forbidden... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve known him my entire life. &lt;br /&gt;Before marriage. &lt;br /&gt;Before fatherhood. &lt;br /&gt;Before betrayal. &lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s one of rock’s bad-boys trying to be good. &lt;br /&gt;Trying to be the best father he can for his daughter. &lt;br /&gt;He’s my brother’s best friend. &lt;br /&gt;He’s my boss. &lt;br /&gt;He has a wife. &lt;br /&gt;Max isn’t mine to have, but I want him all the same. &lt;br /&gt;And I haven’t survived all that I have to not go after what I want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her story is a tragedy, mine’s a publicity disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just when I needed her most, she walked back into my life, and the timing couldn’t be worse. &lt;br /&gt;With a newborn baby, a divorce, an album to record, and a world tour to plan, I don’t need the distraction. &lt;br /&gt;She’s off limits. &lt;br /&gt;She’s my best friend’s little sister. &lt;br /&gt;She’s my nanny. &lt;br /&gt;Billie’s a golden drop of sexy sun on a grey autumn day, tempting me into the light and a life full of possibilities. &lt;br /&gt;A life not meant for us.</description>

  <description>Cold. Callous. Cocky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total playboy with abs for days, a panty-melting smirk, and a face the gods themselves would be jealous of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s my new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of that matters, because as a single mom, men like Alexander Harding are the last thing I need. What I do need is this job, so I’m going to keep my head down, work hard, and avoid that asshole as much as humanly possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then he gives me an offer I can’t refuse, even though everything inside of me is warning me to run away and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just one weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weekend to convince a potential client that Alexander has changed from the player who spent more time in the bedroom than the boardroom into a family man they’d be happy to go into business with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more time I spend with him, the more I realize that there might be a beating heart buried under his designer shirts and spectacular pecs after all…which is bad news for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the only thing worse than hating your boss is falling in love with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Orion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the oldest son of MC royalty. My father founded the Primal Howlers and he expects me to wear his patch one day. The problem is, I don’t know if that’s what I want. Lately, I couldn’t give two sh*ts about anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raquel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved to Monument, Colorado to write my thesis and get some much-needed distance from my overbearing family. What I didn’t expect was to find is myself hung up on a biker who appears to have nothing to lose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, however, have everything to lose and I’m worried Orion just might be my downfall.</description>

  <description>Getting married at eighteen wasn't the smartest idea but ... I'd been in love. Bryce, with his perfect words, his money, and all-American good looks. He had pulled me in, and when he spit me out, I'd barely been left alive. &lt;br /&gt;Now at twenty two and divorced, I just wanted to build a life for myself on my own terms. Free of fear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First job. First crappy apartment. First taste of freedom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Ethan King. The guy from high school I never had a chance with. As the leader of the local motorcycle gang, he's not exactly an outstanding citizen, but he's the one bright spot in my life. He's exactly what I need right now. Until Bryce, who never could accept losing, decides he's not ready to let me go. And if there is one thing I know about that monster, it's that he has no problem destroying everything in my world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only this time I have Ethan King. And no one messes with a King. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Full length- standalone novel with adult sexy scenes. &lt;br /&gt;*Dark romance &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Falling in love is easy…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Hope, South Carolina is my home. It’s where I grew up, got into trouble, and fell in love for the first time. Scarlett Kincaid was more than the girl next door, she was my best friend, until she decided that small town life wasn’t for her. One minute she was here, and the next she was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl I used to fish with down at the creek is now the biggest name in country music. She headlines world tours, has won four Grammy’s, and I haven’t seen her since. Until today when she sped through town in her fancy car. One look at her big brown eyes was all it took to stir up a whole slew of emotions. Emotions I’d long ago buried and sure as hell don’t have time for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s the aftermath that’s hard…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things in my life that matter. My music, and my dad. Twelve years ago, I packed a bag and chased my dream. Leaving New Hope and escaping the gossip mill was the easiest decision I ever made. I never planned to return, but my father needs me, and he always comes first. So, I did what I had to do. I cut my tour short and came home, despite having a sister who hates me, and a community that doesn’t trust me. And then there’s Tucker Andrews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he propped an arm on the roof of my car, pulled down his sunglasses and flashed his police badge, I nearly swallowed my tongue. Gone is the lanky boy who used to throw rocks at me and pull my pigtails. Tucker is now a six-foot package of brawny, sexy man wrapped in more muscle than I have hit singles. Did I mention he’s a cop and a single dad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal was to help Dad, and get back to my life. But what am I supposed to when the life that used to strangle me suddenly fits like a glove, and makes me dream of things I never thought I’d have? What happens when the boy I walked away from years ago becomes one of the most important people in my life? I don’t have room in my life for a man much less love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Because it’s impossible to hold onto someone who’s already gone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nico Merryweather&lt;/b&gt; loves women—all women. Sure, they’re sexy and fun. But “Player” is an easy reputation to hide behind, a way to keep the good times rolling and reality at bay. He’s loud, he’s cocky, he says exactly what he’s thinking, and people just laugh it off because they think they know him. But Nico makes sure no one is close enough to know the truth. With a new season starting, he is ready to play the game he can control. They’ll all be watching Nico, the goalie, but they’ll never know the man behind the mask who is just trying to breathe. He hasn’t ever wanted anyone close enough to him to see the truth, until Aviva rams herself into his ass. Literally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Aviva Pearce&lt;/b&gt;’s life is a collection of bad days all wrapped up without a bow. If it can go wrong, it will. All she wants is to run her business, take care of her sister, and keep her head above water. But with a father who is out to ruin her like he has himself and debt trying to drown her, it’s hard to stay afloat. Aviva isn’t the type to waste time dwelling on her misfortunes or to give up, though. She’s got too much fight in her. And she definitely doesn’t have time to waste on the wildly sexy, rich, showboating goaltender everyone wants. She’s got goals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that Nico has goals of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And she’s number one on his list.</description>

  <description>The son of an icon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was a legend. Rock royalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man I never met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’m measured against him in every aspect of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I feel like me … the real me … is when I’m onstage with my band. But the more we grow in popularity, the more people compare me to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not him. And I never will be. If only everyone could figure that out for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a break from it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, a confrontation has me jumping in my car, putting LA in my rearview mirror. And a stupid mistake ends up with my car on the side of the road. And straight into the path of a girl who is the exact opposite of everyone else in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s like everything I used to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she has no clue who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if she did, I don’t think she’d care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks I’m cavalier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think she’s intriguing. And hot. Let’s not forget hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m stuck in this town overnight while my car is being fixed. But I’m thinking I’m gonna stick around a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Storm Slater, lead guitarist in Slater Raze and the only child of the late, great Jonny Creed. But, here, right now … I’m nobody. Just a regular guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m liking it a whole lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m liking her even more.</description>

Until now.&lt;br /&gt;The club has been infiltrated. &lt;br /&gt;There’s a cop who knows too much. &lt;br /&gt;And it’s my job as President to clean up this sh*t. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t afford any distractions. &lt;br /&gt;But when Hayley slams into my bike, she’s all I think about. &lt;br /&gt;Her thick curves make me want to take her for a ride. &lt;br /&gt;She quickly becomes the stress relief that I need. &lt;br /&gt;However, the closer we get, the more questions about the club she has. &lt;br /&gt;I won’t risk the club again with another outsider. &lt;br /&gt;Even though I’m starting to feel Hayley could be so much more. &lt;br /&gt;Can I trust her with the most important part of my life…and my heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone is the second book in The Lost Boys MC series.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A perilous mission…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanti Lahiri’s tragic family history inspired her to fight for justice. Now a prosecutor with the International Criminal Court, she doesn’t have time for dating or relationships. When an investigation takes her to the Rohingya refugee camps in her father’s homeland of Bangladesh, the last thing she wants is an armed security team following her everywhere and frightening her already traumatized witnesses. But others who’ve tried to investigate these crimes have gone missing, and Shanti doesn’t want to be the next one to disappear. Despite her misgivings, she has no choice but to accept their protection. And, no, the fact that the team’s leader is lethally sexy has nothing to do with her decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;An undeniable attraction…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connor O’Neal left the Unit—Delta Force—after a decade of war, scarred both inside and out. Now an operative with Cobra International Security, he’s been tasked with protecting Shanti in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. He can handle anything the bad guys throw at him, but nothing prepares him for the instant attraction he feels to Shanti. From the first moment he sees her, he wants her. Too bad, because clients are strictly off-limits, and he’s a man who follows the rules—most of the time. Besides, he can’t afford any distractions when Shanti’s life is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A merciless enemy…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something about Shanti breaks through Connor’s defenses, forcing him to confront his demons. As their mutual desire transforms into reckless passion, Shanti discovers evidence crucial to putting a mastermind of genocide behind bars. Connor knows her life is in immediate danger, but his plan to get her out of the country comes crashing down when a traitor strikes, leaving the two of them stranded in the jungles of Myanmar. Now on the run from a ruthless killer and his army, Connor and Shanti are fighting for survival—and a chance at the love of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He acts like he barely knows her.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But she knows he’s the one.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matt Banks was ready to tell Harper Sanders that he loved her, that he’d always loved her and that even though they were young, she was his forever girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then her brother stepped in, wanting more for his sister than a garage owner. Too young to stand up for himself, Matt made her brother a promise that he’s regretted every day since. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After years of being ignored by the guy she’s always loved, Harper is on a dating binge. No one is Matt, but a girl can keep on trying. Then she gets stranded on the side of the road, and she has no choice but to call the only mechanic in town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matt comes to her rescue, and then to her bed. It’s an idyllic, passion-filled weekend—but there’s still the matter of his promise. And a man’s word is his bond. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;i&gt;Take Me Now&lt;/i&gt; is a never before published SHORT story in the &lt;i&gt;Knight Brothers&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>They call me the rocker’s princess, some even call me the dance prodigy, but none of them knows the real Mia Armstrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that dancing is no longer my future, I don’t know either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I want is the opportunity to find out, to have some time to try being just a little normal. To discover who this new girl is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fought for the chance to go to college on my own. Without the guards overshadowing my shot at a real college experience, drawing unwanted attention and making it impossible to learn new things about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal was to get my degree and start my own dance school. Barrick wasn’t part of that goal, but suddenly, he was everywhere—and I was so damn tempted. His arms felt so good wrapped around me, making me feel safer than I’d ever felt in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Barrick had more secrets than I could ever hope to uncover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one just might break me completely.</description>

Mason Wilder is America's most eligible rock star. Now, I'm going to make him mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's my best friend's little sister. She's off limits. She's Tessa Blade Garcia, a girl who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. And now she's after me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've know her since the day she was born, but it's taken me 22 years to realize how much I love her. Just when everything seems perfect, my world get turned upside down, and I need to take sides between people I've loved and trusted my entire life, and someone I never thought I'd see again.</description>

I can’t stand her, but I can’t stop thinking about her, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Blade was born into a world of extravagance.&lt;br /&gt;Sindy Cavanaugh can barely afford to pay for necessities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has a close and loving family who support him.&lt;br /&gt;She has dysfunctional parents who only call her for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their backgrounds couldn’t be more different, but music brought them together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they meet, they challenge one another with defiant attitudes and oversized egos, and their constant arguing disrupts rehearsals. They come to realize that the turbulence between them is really only a guise for suppressed passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their band about to go mainstream, they need to figure out if they should put their feelings on hold or risk everything they’ve worked toward.</description>

  <description>They call him ‘Wilde Man’. Rumor has it he’s an animal on the ice and between the sheets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like the rest of the female population, I’ve been crushing on Clancy Wilde, the captain of Boston University’s hockey team, since the first time I saw him. Big, blond, and charming, he ticks all the boxes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we find ourselves at a wedding, drunk and flirting, I know I can finally check this tattooed, bad boy, hockey player off my wish list. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night is all it was meant to be, until I see two pink lines on the pregnancy test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How did the notch on my belt turn into a ball and chain?</description>

  <description>It started out like any normal day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the fender bender happened. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The guy I collided with drove an expensive car and was drop-dead gorgeous. Too bad he was also a total jerk. We argued over whose fault it was and any other thing that came out of his condescending mouth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the police came and we went our separate ways. The insurance companies would have to figure things out. I had a job interview to get to anyway—one I was excited about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though that excitement changed to disappointment the moment the person interviewing me walked in. &lt;i&gt;The guy from the accident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Whoops!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, so I didn’t get the position.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem was, I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wanted it. No, I &lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt; it. Anything to get me out of my current career and back into working with kids.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, even though Hollis LaCroix was as intimidating as he was devastatingly handsome, I went back to see him and begged for a chance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, he gave me a shot taking care of his troubled niece.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least my attraction to him wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. I wasn’t about to jeopardize my job or the strong bond Hailey and I formed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But resisting the magnetic pull between us wasn’t that simple. (Then there was our little underwear game—don’t ask.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We continued to flirt without crossing the line—until it finally happened. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the part of the story where we fall in love and live happily ever after, right?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, life has a way of throwing some major curveballs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ours was one I didn’t see coming.</description>

  <description>Our arrangement was simple—just physical and definitely no falling in love. That seemed easy enough until a positive pregnancy test changed everything. He’s loud, crude, sexy, and can cook and he’s bound and determined to make me his, but I’ve been burned before and if I let him in, and things don’t work out for us, well, it’s more than just my heart on the line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I push past my issues to open my heart to that big beautiful man? As we navigate this unfamiliar terrain his enthusiasm begins to knock down the walls I’ve always kept around me, but we keep hitting obstacles that could ruin everything we’re trying to build. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I strong enough to battle my own demons to move forward to a future that could promise to be everything I could’ve hoped for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"A single parent, opposites attract romance that will captivate you from the very first page"- New York Times bestselling author, Kaylee Ryan&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinary, typical, conformed, are words never used to describe me. I've never been one to play by the rules. It's my world, my life and I do things my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the way they stare at my body covered in tattoos and my lavender hair, I just don't give a damn. There is only one thing in this world that can get me fired up, that's screwing with my daughter. As a single mom, it's my job to protect her, fight for her. She is and will always be my top priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I get a call that she's in trouble at school, with a boy- no less, my claws are out and ready to strike. And the boy's father, some high society stockbroker, isn't about to deter me. I don't care how sexy, smart and rugged he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposites may attract, and I've been down that road before, it's one I never plan to travel again. A man like that would never be interested in a woman like me. That I know for certain, after all I'm a realist.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They all thought they knew him…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;but she knew his &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seth Brothers had it all: the hottest album in the world, more money than he’d ever dreamed of, and Dirty—the band he loved like family. But as Dirty hit the big time, Seth hit bottom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now all Seth’s got is the guitar on his back, a heart full of regrets, and one last chance to get it all back… including the one thing he never expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elle Delacroix &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; it all—talent, money, fame… except the one thing that truly matters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing Seth has left to give. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are two sides to every rock ’n’ roll story;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;it’s time for Seth to tell his.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Seth&lt;/b&gt; is the third full-length novel in the &lt;b&gt;Dirty&lt;/b&gt; series—a rockstar romance series about the members of the rock band Dirty and the women and men who love them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Novels in the Dirty series are interconnected standalones, each with an HEA; other books (novella/story collection) are not HEA, but are essential pieces of the overall story arcs. (There are ongoing storylines that develop throughout the series; reading them in order is not crucial but is HIGHLY recommended.)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reading order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Me&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #1)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Us&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #0.5) (novella)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Brody&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #2)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Dirty Wedding Night&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #2.5)(story collection)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Seth&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #3)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Dylan&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #4)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Jude&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #5)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Zane&lt;/b&gt; (Dirty #6)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was her first true love…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And the worst mistake she ever made.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; been a spark between Jude Grayson and Roni “Wild Card” Webber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, whenever it ignites… it &lt;i&gt;explodes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they both get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As head of security for Dirty—his best friend’s rock band—and a member of the West Coast Kings motorcycle club, Jude had a choice to make, long ago. Loyalty or love. Brotherhood or &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the woman he left behind is suddenly everywhere he turns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, Roni’s still got a wild side—and another biker for a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… And Jude’s got a fire for her that just won’t die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Roni and Jude are about to play a dangerous game.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A game they’ve never known how to win...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;and their hearts can’t afford to lose.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Like Jude&lt;/b&gt; is the fifth full-length novel in the &lt;b&gt;Dirty&lt;/b&gt; series—a rockstar romance series about the members of the rock band Dirty and the women and men who love them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Novels in the Dirty series are interconnected standalones, each with an HEA; other books (novella/story collection) are not HEA, but are essential pieces of the overall story arcs.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was all she ever wanted. Then she broke his heart…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As longtime manager of Dirty, the hottest rock band on the planet, gorgeous and brooding Brody Mason has had his share of beautiful women. Yet the only one he’s ever wanted is the one he never had—the one who tore his heart out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and elusive Jessa Mayes appears to have it all. Talent, money, and a glamorous life. But she also has a secret. Six years ago, she ran away—from her dream career as a songwriter with Dirty, and the only man she’s ever loved—without telling anyone why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Jessa’s doing the one thing she swore she’d never do. She’s coming home—to be a bridesmaid in her brother’s rock star wedding… and face the mistakes of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won’t be easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this intense never is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Like Brody is the second full-length novel in the Dirty series—a rockstar romance series about the members of the rock band Dirty and the women and men who love them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Novels in the Dirty series are interconnected standalones, each with an HEA. (There are ongoing storylines that develop throughout the series, so reading them in order is not crucial but is recommended.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reading order:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Like Me (Dirty #1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Like Us (Dirty #0.5) (novella)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty Like Brody (Dirty #2)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gorgeous rock star.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An indecent proposal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can a girl resist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling barista Katie Bloom doesn’t even know who Jesse Mayes is until she inadvertently wins the coveted role of sex kitten in his hot new music video. But by the time she’s in bed with him, she knows his reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love maker. Heartbreaker.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Making out with a stranger in front of a camera crew isn’t how Katie imagined herself getting over a broken heart, but when Jesse touches her, sparks fly. The sex is fake but the chemistry is real, and soon the steamy video is blazing up the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Jesse makes Katie an irresistible offer: act as his girlfriend for six weeks while he promotes his new album. The only catch? Their sizzling make-out sessions will be for the cameras only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is fine with Katie, since she's not about to trust her heart to rock's most legendary lover. Her body? Maybe…</description>

  <description>The former Tin Gypsy motorcycle club has everyone in Clifton Forge, Montana convinced they’ve locked their clubhouse doors and ripped off their patches. Everyone but Bryce Ryan. There’s more happening at the club’s garage than muscle car restorations and Harley rebuilds. Her instincts are screaming there’s a story—one she’s going to tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the new owner of the small town’s newspaper, Bryce is hungry for more than birth announcements and obituaries. When a woman is brutally killed and all signs point to the Tin Gypsies, Bryce is determined to expose the club and their leader, Kingston “Dash” Slater, as murderers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bryce bests Dash match after match, disappointed her rugged and handsome opponent turns out to be an underwhelming adversary. Secrets are exposed. Truths defeat lies. Bryce is poised to win this battle in a landslide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Dash breaks all the rules and tips the scales. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss, and she’s fighting to save more than just her story. She’s fighting to save her heart from the Gypsy King.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Vivienne&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;That was my motto, and I was sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;Having my heart broken once was enough, and I never wanted to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;He was supposed to be a one-night stand, the only thing I do.&lt;br /&gt;One rule shouldn’t be so hard to follow, but then I went back for seconds, then thirds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I lost count of the number of times I lost myself in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;When I wasn’t paying attention, my guard slipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call me Private Mark for a reason—my whole life is a secret.&lt;br /&gt;For two years, we danced around each other until I got her right where I wanted her ... under me.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I had her, I wasn't letting her go. I thought we were on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;I thought we were building something great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I ever wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that while I was falling in love, she was trying to convince herself we were temporary.&lt;br /&gt;She thought I’d walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's time to convince her she wants us too and to show her that the crazy, wild thing we have ... This Is Love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s love. Trust me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime on the move, Ivy Snow is an expert in all things temporary—schools, friends, and way too many Mr. Wrongs. Now that she owns a successful taco truck in San Francisco and an apartment to call home, Ivy’s reinvented life is on solid ground. And she’s guarded against anything that can rock it. Like the realities of a past she’s worked hard to cover up. And especially Kel O’Donnell. Too hot not to set off alarms, he screams temporary. If only his whispers weren’t so delightfully naughty and irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kel, an Idaho sheriff and ranch owner, is on vacay, but Ivy’s a spicy reason to give his short-terms plans a second thought. Best of all, she’s a tonic for his untrusting heart, burned once and still in repair. But when Ivy’s past intrudes on a perfect romance, Kel fears that everything she’s told him has been a perfect lie. Now, if only Ivy’s willing to share, Kel will fight for a &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; love story.</description>

  <description>Family is number one; whether they are blood related or patched in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirteen-years-old, the bastard son of an asshole who wanted me to fail, I learned that lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to one man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam Walker raised me, taught me how to be an adult, and loved the hell out of my mother, me, and my sisters. He funneled my anger into productiveness when teenage me lost the love of his life. Because of him, I knew how to love her when she came back. His dedication to me and my sisters was the example I needed when my twins were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracing his footsteps may not have been my birthright, but him turning over the president patch to me is what I’ve waited for since I was thirteen. Calm, cool, and collected – that’s how he ran The Heaven Hill MC – and it’s how I’ve run it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambushed on our own streets. Fighting an enemy we didn’t know we had. Innocent people hurt all because of a misguided sense of entitlement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between me and Liam? I have anger I’ve held back, kept my emotions under control for half my life, been the loving man I’m supposed to be, but for this piece of shit who threatened us? I’m about to unleash something he’s never seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fury.</description>

  <description>There wasn’t much I wanted out of life but having my bakery succeed, being able to continue doing what I loved to do, and finding a woman who could make me feel whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the moment she walked into my bakery, I knew there would be no other for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For months, I watched her sit at that little table in the corner and read. For months, I thought of a million different things I wanted to say to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might not have stalked her, but I sure as hell wanted to. I thought about it. Finding more out about Zara, and all the things I wanted to do to her, had become an obsession.  Zara was gorgeous and curvy … exactly the type of woman I fantasized about having by my side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But finding the courage to man up and go after what I wanted—her—was harder than I thought. I guess when you find the perfect person for you, the idea of being rejected could turn anyone into a coward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until one day I wasn’t willing to let her walk by without me saying something to her. I couldn’t stay away. I wanted more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whipped, that’s what I was, but only for Zara.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds comes the first novel in the fun, sexy, and thrilling How to Catch an Alpha series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leah Emerson isn’t looking for a man—she’s looking for the right man. But her mother’s idea of a great catch leaves her cold, and she’s pretty sure her cocky, arrogant, and way too good-looking new neighbor isn’t the one either. If only her wayward cat would stop jumping through his window, she could get on with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyler Duncan moved into town for a new job, not to fall in love. But he always goes after the things he wants in life with steadfast determination…and he wants Leah Emerson. He wants her smiles, he wants her touch, and he definitely wants her in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, someone else wants Leah—in the worst way. Now Tyler’s on a mission to protect the woman he’s falling in love with while proving he’s worth falling for, and Leah must decide whether Tyler is a catch worth catching…</description>

  <description>Up until two years ago, I was living large and my life’s priorities were anchored to three things – my NBA stardom, money and celebrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also a colossal dick. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one night turned my world upside down and I suffered unspeakable loss. That event changed the man I was and made me a widowed-single father. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m a desperate parent trying to raise my special needs son and find him a trustworthy live-in nanny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grad student Brooklyn Hayes may be the one, with her single-minded focus on caring for my son and finishing her Master’s degree. She’s the perfect fit for our needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe too perfect… with her bright smile, nurturing kindness and gentle touch. Caleb isn’t the only one who’s fallen for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know when or how it happened, but she changed the game for me. Turning my losing streak into a winning second-half. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Game Changer&lt;/i&gt; is a Single Dad/Nanny Romance.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I know two things when I meet my new boss, Greyson Parker Montgomery III. &lt;br /&gt;One, he’s an egomaniac. And two, we’re going to get naked. &lt;br /&gt;Something I didn’t know? That I’d end up pregnant.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one is more surprised by our off-the-charts chemistry than me. I’m a free spirit with a passion for design and a taste for the bohemian. Greyson is a cocky venture capitalist who’s as pretentious as his sharply cut power suits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He owns half of Charleston, and has the other half at his beck and call. But the only place he owns me is in bed...or in the backseat of his car, boneless and begging for mercy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We argue over contracts and costs all day long. Behind closed doors, however, we engage in a different kind of business. The kind that has me surrendering to his unique brand of dominance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our no-strings attached arrangement suits me just fine. Until I wake up one morning with what I think is a wicked hangover. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only it’s not a hangover.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought Greyson was a typical “greed is good” grump. But when he demands to be involved in the life we accidentally created, I start to see a different side of him. One that’s more gentleman than jerk.Am I crazy to think we could be a family together? Or is making me fall for him just another one of his power plays? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN is a STANDALONE, full length, accidental pregnancy/enemies-to-lovers romance.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>TORI &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been living on borrowed time since I was born. &lt;br /&gt;My dreams were big. But my reality cut them down to size. &lt;br /&gt;The life I’ve settled for is small. &lt;br /&gt;Safe. &lt;br /&gt;Stifling. &lt;br /&gt;Until I meet him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s my forbidden fruit. My guilty pleasure. My greatest danger. &lt;br /&gt;He has me dreaming of a life I never thought I could have. &lt;br /&gt;He teaches me to hope. To want. To &lt;i&gt;crave.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I’m not careful, Dante D’Agostino will have me dreaming of happily ever afters. &lt;br /&gt;And that’s the most dangerous dream of all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DANTE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t believe in miracles. &lt;br /&gt;Fairy tales are for chumps. &lt;br /&gt;In my world, only the strong survive, and love is a weakness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I meet her. &lt;br /&gt;She’s no princess in a tower. &lt;br /&gt;She’s a fighter. A warrior. &lt;br /&gt;She’s the strongest woman I know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before I knew it, she set my life ablaze. &lt;br /&gt;Then, before I could stop her, she melted my iron heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This sure as f*ck ain’t no fairy tale. I don’t know what the f*ck it is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Lois Lane doesn’t need a superman. She doesn’t want a protector. &lt;br /&gt;But protect her I will. With my life if I have to. &lt;br /&gt;Tori Lowe has changed my life forever. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m never going back. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Death and pain.&lt;br /&gt;They surround me. Hold me hostage, refusing to let go.&lt;br /&gt;But I want to survive. Want to fight. I just don’t know if I have it in me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe dying would be better.&lt;br /&gt;It’s the break in the shadows that gives me hope.&lt;br /&gt;When I look at him, all I can see is light. &lt;br /&gt;So now I’m out to find freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private investigator Ryan Warden doesn’t know he’s moved next door to people he would put behind bars in an instant. Nor does he realise a sleepless night could lead him on the right track with the case he’s working on. &lt;br /&gt;He certainly doesn’t expect Emerson Spence.&lt;br /&gt;What he does know is he has to stay away from her. She’s been beaten and broken. She deserves to live freely while learning and experiencing things in life like any young woman should. &lt;br /&gt;He’s too old for her. It’s better to stay away. &lt;br /&gt;If he can.</description>

  <description>Gwen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, life definitely isn't how I envisioned it. I had it all. The house, the job, the husband. Until one day, I didn't. I don't know when exactly things started to change between us, only that it did, and in a big way. So much so, I found myself standing before a judge and signing off on the end of my marriage. To the only man I've ever loved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he's back, fighting, and ready to prove to me that we made a mistake, that our love is worth giving this another chance. I'm not sure if he's right, but I know what my heart wants, and it wants him. My ex-husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it that you don't know the depths of your mistakes until you've already made them? I knew signing those papers was a bad idea, but I thought that's what she wanted. The minute we stepped foot out of that courtroom, it hit me. She's no longer mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when I also realized that I would do anything to change the past. I have so many regrets. Not her. I could never regret her, but how we ended. We never should have ended. I'm in for the battle of my life to convince her to give us another shot. I have a plan, one that will prove to her that it's not over.</description>

  <description>He’s a hockey star with a headboard full of notches. She’s a shy NHL concession worker at who’s never been kissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lindy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don’t call me Belinda Boring for nothing. It’s my name, after all. And for a 23-year-old with plain brown hair who still lives at home and gets tongue tied over nothing, it’s a fitting one. I’m not even one of those quiet girls with a hidden talent, unless making a mean order of nachos at the NHL arena I work at counts. My life consists of working, reading and harboring a secret crush on a hockey player who doesn’t know I exist. At least, until we accidentally meet and become unlikely friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m living the dream. A poor kid who worked his way into the NHL, I’ll never forget where I came from, though I try to. My past follows me, a nagging reminder that I’ll never be what everyone thinks I am. As the threat of my secret being exposed looms closer, my game slips, leaving me in danger of being cut from my team--the only family I have. I’m losing my hold on everything when a new friend helps me find hope. She’s nothing like the women I’m used to, but by the time I figure out that’s exactly why she’s right for me, I’ve lost my chance with her. Somehow, I have to convince a woman who thinks she’s invisible that she’s the only one I see.</description>

  <description>What would you sacrifice to save your family’s legacy? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meet Hunter Wilder, a man that is terrified of happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hunter is used to dominating, taking control of situations and bending them to his will. He may live in a New York castle, but he’s no prince. Cursed by loss, Hunter is a closed book with an emptiness that he can’t escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he meets her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gabriella Darien may be gorgeous and driven, but her Cinderella story is more than it appears. The death of her father left her with a wicked stepmother intent on sabotaging the business her parents worked so hard to create. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One enchanted night of all-consuming and absolute pleasure brings two broken souls together. With a new version of their future finally in sight, a promise kept might cost them everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this Cinderella find her prince, or will they watch their happily ever after disappear at the stroke of midnight? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABSOLUTE PLEASURE is a modern, sinfully seductive take on Cinderella. It is a stand-alone, second-chance fairy-tale romance. No cheating. No cliffhangers.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>How far would you go to make the man that destroyed your family pay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddux Wilder is a man consumed, a beast in a three-piece suit. Rich and powerful, he built his empire with one thought in mind: revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of patience and planning, the wait is finally over. Tonight, Maddux will finally watch Theodore Cole’s kingdom crumble. At a lavish ball in the New York City castle the Wilder siblings call home, the man that killed their parents will atone for his sins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he’d planned for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arabella Cole is Theodore’s only child; his cherished and sheltered daughter. She’s an innocent, captivating beauty that would do anything to save her loving father, including sacrificing herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her freedom gone, she must surrender to a man she hates. A man that makes her want things she shouldn’t. A man that awakens deep, forbidden desires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everyone knows that roses don’t bloom in darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Maddux Wilder, a man that doesn’t believe in fairy tales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the beauty tame the beast or will revenge cost them both everything that matters most?</description>

  <description>A new, sexy standalone from #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller, Vi Keeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first encountered Ford Donovan, I had no idea who he was…well, other than the obvious. Young, gorgeous, successful, smart. Did I mention young? If I did, it bears repeating. Ford Donovan was &lt;i&gt;too young&lt;/i&gt; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s back up to how it all started. My best friend decided I needed to start dating again. So, without my knowledge, she set up a profile for me on a popular dating site—one that invited men ages twenty-one to twenty-seven to apply for a date. Those nicknamed &lt;i&gt;Cunnilingus King&lt;/i&gt; were told they’d go straight to the top for consideration. The profile wasn’t supposed to go live. Another point that bears repeating—it wasn’t &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, that’s how I met Ford, and we started messaging. He made me laugh; yet I was adamant that because of his age, we could only be friends. But after weeks of wearing me down, I finally agreed to &lt;i&gt;one date only&lt;/i&gt;—my first after twenty years of being with my high school sweetheart. I knew it couldn’t last, but I was curious about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, you know what they say…&lt;i&gt;curiosity kills the cat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs wobbled walking into the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;Ford was seated at the bar. When he turned around, he took my breath away.&lt;br /&gt;His sexy smile nearly melted my panties. &lt;br /&gt;But…he looked &lt;i&gt;so familiar&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;As I got closer I realized why. &lt;br /&gt;He was the son of the neighbor at our family’s summer home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The boy next door&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Only now…he was all man. &lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t seen him in years.&lt;br /&gt;I left the restaurant and planned to put the entire crazy thing behind me. &lt;br /&gt;Which I did. &lt;i&gt;Until summer came&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;And guess who decided to use his family’s summer home this year?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the beginning, there was one determined man and one strong woman. In their struggles, they created a dynasty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brick had one mission since he was a boy: become a Dragon Runner. The motorcycle club meant everything to him. Blood and bone from his brothers paid the Dragon’s dues time and time again. And watching it split apart was more than he could handle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he met Betsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unwanted daughter born into abuse, Betsy lived her life beatdown under a rigid thumb, never allowed to be herself. Her one goal was to leave her abusive family and be free. She fought on the losing end of that fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she met Brick.</description>

  <description>Mistakes were made, okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I laid eyes on Kyle Kingston I knew he was a mistake. A satisfying, toe curling, hair pulling, best night of my life mistake, but a mistake all the same. I didn’t yet know his name, or who he was, but I knew he was a bad idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take comfort in that, because it means my instincts are still good. Too late, but it’s something.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, FYI, I’m pregnant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… and did I mention my baby daddy is both heir to a retail empire and impossible to get ahold of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do what any girl would. I break into his Grandfather’s retirement gala by telling the prissy gatekeeper Kyle’s my fiancé. It was a halfway decent plan at the time, trust me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it blows up in my face, disastrously so. You see, Kyle Kingston is all about representing the family values his family’s retail empire was founded on. At least in public. In private- well I’ll tell you about that later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He proposes – a marriage of convenience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient for everyone but me, because while I’m falling in love with my convenient husband, he’s keeping a billion-dollar secret. From me.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Wind Dragons and Cursed Ravens MC series comes sinners, saints and secrets…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Skylar,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years. That’s a long time to go without talking to somebody, especially someone who was such a huge part of your life…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A letter from my first kiss and my childhood everything…from prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He may be nicknamed Saint, but this sweet, sexy biker most definitely has a wild streak. Hearing from him draws me right back into the Knights of Fury motorcycle club—the people I’ll always think of as family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s still the only man I’ve ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each good, old-fashioned letter from my “prison pen pal” has my heart racing. Which is nothing compared to how I feel when Saint surprises me in person, as a free man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just a kid the last time we saw each other, but the connection between us now is anything but innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s the type of man who would do anything to protect his woman. And with my world crashing down around me, that’s exactly what I’m going to need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 67,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: This book is part of the Knights of Fury MC series but can be read as a stand-alone.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Claire and Jude Sinclair have been living the perfect life for the last ten years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blissfully in love, professionally successful, happily married… They have everything they want—except a baby to make their family complete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the eve of the birth of the baby they’re planning to adopt, Jude gets traded to another hockey team in another state, and their thoughtfully planned-out road to parenthood hits a speed bump. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they didn’t survive all the turmoil of their pasts to get knocked out now. This is their game seven, and they won’t accept anything less than a win for the family they’re destined to have.</description>

  <description>I have three superstitions I live by:&lt;br /&gt;1. No dating all season.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don’t jinx a no-hitter while one’s in progress. &lt;br /&gt;3. Be cold-hearted. If you find something you think about more than baseball, destroy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calliope Thomas is one of those things. Ever since she left a bad review on the Max Energy Drink I endorse, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her. Obviously, when she said she hoped I had a losing season, I had to meet her and get her to take the words back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s making me do insane things. Like, obsess over the color of her panties or if I can make her blush. Read superstition one—I don’t do this sort of thing. &lt;br /&gt;I play ball, not chase after a woman I barely know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I am, and she wants nothing to do with me. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I’m the devil. &lt;br /&gt;And I have to say she makes me want to sin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m becoming a borderline stalker. &lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse she’s affecting my game. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t pitch. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t hit. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t focus. &lt;br /&gt;Something needs to give, and it won’t be me.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It was just supposed to be a one-night stand— Until he stole her life story and put it in a song. &lt;br /&gt;Now he’s rock’s hottest new artist— And she’s just found out she’s having his baby. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rory is a pierced and inked tattoo artist by day at Brothers Ink, but by night he’s lead guitarist for the heavy metal rock band, Convicted Chrome. He’s headed East on his Harley to catch up with the tour. Beautiful Rayne is headed West on her motorcycle with her girl squad…the Moto Babes. When rain forces them all to take refuge in the same motel, sparks fly. A night of drinking and karaoke leads to a connection deeper than either of them expects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Rayne&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; — What do you do when someone writes a song about your most private feelings and experiences and you hear it on the radio for the first time? What do you do when that song is climbing the charts, and the man who stole your life story is suddenly rock’s hottest new artist? What do you do when you find out you’re having his baby? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Rory&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; — After a long songwriting drought, he’s met a woman who sparked something in him and got his creative juices flowing. He’s written one of his best songs ever. When a friend in the business gives him the break of a lifetime he’s suddenly topping the charts. But Rory’s not ready for the instant stratosphere of success he’s catapulted into. Caught up in a whirlwind career that offers temptations and sin at every turn, is Rory losing the biggest part of himself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix his career and more importantly himself, he’ll have to go back and fix the damage he’s done and apologize to the people he’s wronged in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And one person in particular tops that list. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the last person you want to be with is the one you can’t be without&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A member of the Insurgents MC, Animal is a rough, free-loving biker. Hanging with his brothers, riding his customized Harley, and partying with the ladies are his idea of the ideal life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Years ago, he made a stupid mistake with a woman he barely knew, but he pays the child support every month and sends cards and presents to his out-of-state daughter on her birthday and on holidays. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t want a steady woman, and he certainly isn’t ready to settle down and have a family. Life is just too good now, and there are always so many women who want to come and play with this rugged biker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one afternoon, the mother of his child struts into the clubhouse with his daughter in tow and tells him she’s done. She walks away, leaving Animal and Lucy staring at each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s he supposed to do? He knows about bikes and hard partying, not seven-year-old girls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He has to change his ways, and his new hot next-door neighbor isn’t helping to keep his libido in check. The way her long dark hair swings just above her sweet behind has him thinking all kinds of nasty thoughts, but she doesn’t give him the time of day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Olivia Mooney is very aware of her neighbor’s good looks and his finely chiseled body, but she doesn’t want to get involved.&lt;/b&gt; He doesn’t realize it, but she’s his daughter’s tutor at school, and she can’t get involved. She spends her nights thinking about the sexy single father and chatting with an intriguing man on an after dark dating site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a series of murders occur in the surrounding counties, and it looks like they are creeping closer to Pinewood Springs. At first the cops are stumped, but over time a pattern begins to emerge: the women all used an after dark dating site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As fear and danger slink closer, Olivia is thrown into the arms of the sexy biker, forever changing their lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Insurgents MC series are standalone romance novels. This is Animal’s story. This book contains violence, abuse, strong language, and steamy/graphic sexual scenes. It describes the life and actions of an outlaw motorcycle club. HEA. No cliffhangers.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He was going through the motions ... and then he met her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker Knight had and lost it all. Now he works for his family's business, wearing a suit and pretending to be happy. A weekend away to plan a corporate retreat turns into a revelation when he lays eyes on Emily Stevens, the sexy owner of a small lodge that's seen better days. One look at Emily and the run-down resort and suddenly Parker has a purpose. He turns his short stay into a longer one, intending to act on the intense chemistry and desire that runs hot between them. While there, he plans to save Emily and her aging father's business with an infusion of cash and manpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emily doesn't trust slick city guys, especially one who is going to leave when his time off is over. No matter how incredible he makes her feel, in bed and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker has his hands full, not only with a wary Emily but with someone else who doesn't want the lodge to succeed, and if things keep getting worse, not even a Knight can save her.</description>

  <description>Stephen Hastings is a control freak. &lt;br /&gt;He’s arrogant. He’s smart as a whip and &lt;i&gt;sexy AF.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has too much money. He’s bossy, and he’s usually right. &lt;br /&gt;All I saw were his clear blue eyes, tight ass, and ripped torso. &lt;br /&gt;I gladly handed him my V-card that night, ten years ago. &lt;br /&gt;I was so stupid. I swore I’d never be that stupid again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmy Barton works for a dry cleaner? &lt;br /&gt;Yes, that Emmy Barton—long, blonde hair, bright blue eyes, pretty smile… &lt;br /&gt;Sexy little ass. Smart mouth.&lt;br /&gt;She was the only girl who interested me, but I was leaving to be an officer in the Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m home, running my business, my life is perfectly ordered until I bump into her, divorced and struggling to make ends meet. &lt;br /&gt;I hate seeing her like this. I hate that she married Burt “The Dick” Dickerson. &lt;i&gt;What an asshole.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she hates me, but when we fight, it's all heat and lust.&lt;br /&gt;I won’t leave her this way. &lt;br /&gt;She &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; let me help her and her son. She will &lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;br /&gt;It’s a thin line between love and hate, and this line is &lt;i&gt;on fire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(STAY is a STAND-ALONE enemies-to-lovers, second-chance, marriage of convenience romance. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I, Rose Hawthorne, have crap taste in men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, who could blame me, really? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the stories of how your dad and uncles raised hell before settling down are legendary, it was all too easy to see Prince Charming everywhere, believing that if a man loved me enough, he’d change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What a load of garbage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was tired of the game, almost as tired as I was of being the only single adult at every family barbecue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But you know what they say, the moment you stop looking, the right one finds you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the best selling series, Something So comes the spin-off Series This is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe&lt;br /&gt;When you grow up surrounded by hockey players you know one thing for sure, I was never going to settle down with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, I didn’t even know what icing was. I was too busy climbing the corporate ladder, becoming one of the most successful realtors in New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t interested in dating or anything that got in my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, he was my client and then he became my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viktor&lt;br /&gt;My parents told me I skated before I walked. &lt;br /&gt;When I was eighteen I was drafted into the N.H.L third overall, playing in Los Angeles—the city of dreams. &lt;br /&gt;What more could I ask for? I played hard, but eventually, I partied even harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later I was traded a week after I entered rehab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no time for anything except my health and making sure I’d come out on top. I had to be better. &lt;br /&gt;There wasn’t another option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the rules of recovery was ‘don’t fall in love’ and I made it a top priority. She was off limits in every single way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, one decision, one act can derail everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When push comes to shove, I’m only certain that, This is Wild.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best selling series, &lt;i&gt;Something So&lt;/i&gt; comes the spin-off &lt;i&gt;This is...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zara Stone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I’ve said I will never date a hockey player. I know better because I’ve seen and lived it all. My father is a hockey god, my brother is the captain of the most successful NHL team in the world, and my brother-in-law also plays in the league. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their lives are complicated, so I went in the opposite direction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with a scholar. But instead of proposing marriage, he broke up with me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three months later, I saw his engagement picture on Instagram. I couldn’t let him get away with that. No, it didn’t matter what, I was going to make that man see that I did not need him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Richards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the running to pass my point record from last year, ready to claim the number one spot in the league. On top of my game, I was riding my career high wave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Hockey’s Princess, Zara Stone tweeted me. She wanted me to crash her ex’s wedding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst that could happen? A PR nightmare. The best? A fun night with a beautiful woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out as a game—something I’m good at. Her crazy idea twisted into something I wasn’t looking for, something neither of us wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When push comes to shove, one thing runs through my mind: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Crazy. Also, this is crazy right.</description>

  <description>New Sports Romance coming in Spring 2019!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the red zone is the hardest place to score.&lt;br /&gt;But for me, those last twenty yards were my sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;They didn't call me Lukas "Last Minute Lucy" Callihan for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I was at the top of my game...until life sacked me harder than any linebacker ever could.&lt;br /&gt;Losing my mom was devastating and left me as the sole person responsible for my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking care of Ella and juggling my career was like playing the hardest game of my life. &lt;br /&gt;My only saving grace was Scarlett Knox, Ella's sexy, red-headed, no-nonsense teacher. &lt;br /&gt;She loved Ella. She hated me. &lt;br /&gt;She thought I sucked at this parenting thing, and she wasn’t wrong. &lt;br /&gt;But whenever she was around I got the same earth-shattering, heart-stopping feeling I did when I was only twenty yards from the goal line.&lt;br /&gt;She made me feel like I was back in the red zone, a place I’d never fumbled.&lt;br /&gt;Until now. </description>

  <description>Opposites attract.&lt;br /&gt;That’s how movies tell the tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lifestyle—not for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;My oath—to protect the brothers I’ve come to call family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This life isn’t for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;Especially those in the spotlight. &lt;br /&gt;Meeting a Hollywood A-lister isn’t on my bucket list, and falling for one does not suit my plans. &lt;br /&gt;But a biker who hides in the shadows and an actress bathed in neon lights, calls for disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story isn’t only about finding stability—it’s friendship, conflict, deception and slaughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death—it’s coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will we find the right balance?</description>

  <description>I’ve kissed a lot of frogs, just to be covered in warts. I’ve been lied to, cheated on, and used more times than I can count. I don’t have it in me to keep going. I need a break from it all. I need time for the wounds to heal, and the scars to fade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn’t you know it’s my luck, to meet a gorgeous man, after declaring my self-imposed break? He’s charming, sexy, and determined to change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t looking for her, but when I overheard her conversation, I had to add my two cents. Within minutes of talking to her, I knew she was unlike anyone I’d ever met. Bruised from past relationships, she’s built a fort around her heart. Doesn’t she know the prince always rescues the princess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think about her all the time. The more I’m around her, the more I want to be. I’ve made my choice. It’s her. Now, all I have to do is prove to her that I’m the difference.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Choose Me&lt;/i&gt;, RC Boldt brings us an unforgettable, heart-wrenching coming-of-age romance...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing the nicest suit I own, I stand in the very back with a flask full of whiskey in my inner pocket. I put on a brave face as I watch her walk down the aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because it’s too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to be the bastard who makes her cry on her wedding day, but I’m dying to tell her what I’ve always known. She’s my best friend, but she doesn’t realize she owns my f*cking heart and soul, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each step down that aisle takes her farther away from me and brings her closer to him, forcing me to face the truth: I’ve fallen in love with someone who can’t be mine. If she’d just turn around, maybe she’d realize I love her more than he ever could. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t ruin her perfect day, but my broken heart begs me to try and convince her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Choose me.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When we were eleven, Oliver Ford Pemberton dared me to jump off a barn roof. He said you couldn’t break a leg from a 12-foot-jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You can also break a collarbone, which served him right as far as I was concerned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say it was the last dare I ever took from him, the last bet I ever made with him, the last time I ever trusted Oliver Ford Pemberton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he had the nerve to grow up gorgeous, charming, and sexy. And as we got older, the dares only got dirtier—and the betting stakes higher—until finally, he left me in pieces. I swore I’d never talk to him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But twenty years after I took that flying leap, he’s back in my life, daring me to risk everything for him: my job, my self-worth, and my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many chances does love deserve?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Ryder Kyle is a spoiled, self-righteous jerk. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t understand suffering. Entitled guy like him wouldn’t recognize desperation if it smacked him in his perfect face. I don’t need him, but I do need a ride west. I won’t let the guy who reminds me of the mess I left behind interfere with my plan to get to Los Angeles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;This woman is nuts!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People don’t sneak on a tour bus looking for shelter. That’s what crazy fangirls do, but she's far from a fan. She says she’s homeless and asks for help by throwing insults. Her words are like a viper strike and she’s made me her target. We’re dumping her at the next stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skipped a Beat is an enemies to lovers rock star romance that proves one seemingly insignificant choice can change the path of an entire life.</description>

  <description>Logan “Rocket” Carrera has a history he prefers to leave buried under prickly layers of standoffish personality. He’s seen and done things that would make most people lie awake at night. A master of compartmentalization, he’s never had trouble moving on until the night he rescues the redheaded Chloe from a sadistic gang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnapped, beaten, and abused by criminals, Chloe has a difficult time assimilating back into the world after the most traumatic experience of her life. With each passing day, her anxiety builds until she’s forced to find an outlet. Finally, Chloe discovers her own way to make sense of the world and steal a few moments of peace. There’s just one problem: she can’t tell a soul what she’s doing. Who could ever understand the risk she’s taking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to stay away from the fascinating woman who’s screwing with his head just by breathing, Rocket tails Chloe as often as he can. His curiosity over her actions borders on obsession. Before long, and despite the MC president’s orders to keep his distance, Rocket succumbs to the urge to approach her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan, the handsome man Chloe meets in a bar, gives her exactly what she needs. He’s accepting of her unusual requests in a way she hadn’t thought possible. The fantasy unravels, however, when she discovers who he really is, the outlaw biker who saw her at her very lowest moment. Will Chloe be able to accept Logan as the biker, Rocket, and allow him into her life enough to help her heal? The answer won’t matter if his violent past sucks him away before she has a chance to try.</description>

  <description>Loyalty&lt;br /&gt;That's what it's all about here.&lt;br /&gt;I'd do anything for one of my brothers,&lt;br /&gt;Even go with his old lady to a parent-teacher conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I see the sweet little number who's the teacher,&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, school's right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;She's innocent, naive, and sexy as Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn, I just want in her pants,&lt;br /&gt;And to maybe teach her a thing or two.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm not backing down,&lt;br /&gt;I'll get to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if she ever finds out the truth about our connection,&lt;br /&gt;It'll sever the ties and ruin it all.&lt;br /&gt;I'm just going to keep my mouth shut--&lt;br /&gt;And all over her.</description>

  <description>Noah was a player, and he didn't hide the fact. Everyone in town was aware of his status to not commit. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone, except the new girl in town, Valerie.

  <description>Once a Disciple, forever a Disciple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candy didn’t build a life for herself by being stupid,&lt;br /&gt;regardless what people might think of her being a stripper.&lt;br /&gt;And no matter what her body wants, what her heart wants,&lt;br /&gt;she knows that falling for a fighter is as stupid as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Disciple will fight like a savage, but that isn’t always the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Hook’s life has taught him one thing: to fight for what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;He’s fought in the ring, to earn his patch, to protect his family.&lt;br /&gt;And he would fight for Candy, if she’d just give him a chance&lt;br /&gt;to show her that what’s between them could be everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the attraction is at full throttle, this biker knows there’s no giving up.</description>

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes an all-new novel in her beloved With Me In Seattle Series, Dance With Me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Starla. Just Starla. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t have a last name, and she doesn’t need one. Not with that many Grammys on her mantel. Everyone knows her kick-ass, no-holds-barred style of singing, dancing, and living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one knows that America’s Sweetheart is still living with the wreckage of four years ago, when her world was torn apart. Losing her fiancé was devastating, but she’s channeled all of that into her music. Closing off her heart opened a hundred new doors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Officer Levi Crawford, Seattle PD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For almost twenty years, Levi has been consumed by the law. He eats, sleeps, and breathes work. Not just because he’s a workaholic, but because he loves it. Sure, he doesn’t have time for a woman and barely sees the rest of his family, but it’s a trade he’s always been happy to make. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Starla. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two lonely hearts could learn to beat again, if they’re willing to dance together. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Joanna Wylde comes a new story in her Reapers MC series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peaches Taylor spent the last seven years slinging drinks and dodging drunks at the Starkwood Saloon. Some might call it a dead end job, but to her it was an investment—another six months, and she’d have enough money to buy the place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life would've been perfect if Eli hadn’t come home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eli King is ready to settle down. He stood by his brothers when they needed him, paying the price for their freedom with his own. Now it’s time to claim his reward—the Starkwood Saloon. He’s got the cash to buy the bar, the skills to run it, and just one person standing between him and his dream: Peaches Taylor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s been driving him crazy since they were kids, and not in the good way. When she was six, she shoved a spider down his pants. When he was ten, he locked her in a closet overnight. Then she hot-wired his car at seventeen, and things got ugly… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re adults now, and the Starkwood isn’t a toy to fight over—it’s the hill they’ll die on. No prisoners. No compromises. No mercy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peaches Taylor and Eli King are going to war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>CHAOS&lt;br /&gt;That's my life. No other way to describe it. &lt;br /&gt;As the Sargent-at-Arms for the Deathstalkers MC, my days are filled with&lt;br /&gt;Constant craziness and crap. &lt;br /&gt;But I like it. &lt;br /&gt;It's who I am. And what I'm all about.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after years of Hell, everything feels like it's right where it's supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;Except with her&lt;br /&gt;She's far from where she's supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;Tracie is so damned determined to be with someone who isn't "one of us."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Delusional.&lt;br /&gt;That's what she is.&lt;br /&gt;Downright insane at times.&lt;br /&gt;Those idiots can't handle her.&lt;br /&gt;Will never be able to handle her.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm about to show her why.&lt;br /&gt;And she'll finally understand.&lt;br /&gt;Because this life ain't for everyone,&lt;br /&gt;Especially when danger lurks in the shadows of all the&lt;br /&gt;Chaos.</description>

  <description>I was never meant to have a happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;It was a fate I accepted a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Before he came for me, taking away who I am, I needed to escape.&lt;br /&gt;Just for one night.&lt;br /&gt;One man turned my entire world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I should have walked away, but something about him wouldn’t let me.&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m lying to him.&lt;br /&gt;He’s going to find out the truth, or my life will catch up to me.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I lose him.&lt;br /&gt;It’s a thought I can’t bear.&lt;br /&gt;People have always told me love is amazing and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;They’re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It makes you weak…exposing your vulnerabilities…making you easy prey.&lt;br /&gt;Love is heinous.</description>

  <description>Make no mistakes about it. I know what I look like to others. Young, government-aided, pregnant mom. They see Lucy on my hip, and they see a mistake. I mean, why else would someone have a child so young, right? They couldn’t be more wrong. I’m too busy most days between parenting, work, and finishing up my last year of nursing school to let their judging gaze tear me down until he moves in the vacant house next to the apartments I live in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	His cold, blunt observation of us doesn’t differ from any other stranger. He doesn’t know me, but he’s already painting a picture of who he thinks I am in his mind. He judges my very round belly, Lucy’s inability to leave him alone, the bags under my eyes, and the fact that I could not care less what I look like anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	He’s a rude guy. Stays that way for months too. Then something happens, I’m not even sure what. Judgmental Guy decides Lucy and me — as well as baby Eli — are worth his friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Turns out, Judgmental Guy isn’t too mean — okay, he kind of still is. But he graduates to Elijah. I build an unlikely friendship with him which deems it necessary for him to start smiling around me and my kids. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	I’m wrong again. Elijah isn’t rude. He’s terrifying. His strange acts of kindness are unraveling me. Elijah is only my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Oh, fudge. I think I’m wrong. Again.</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling author, the second book in the Laurel Springs Emergency Response Team Series &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you don't love, you can't get hurt... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nick Kepler &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing my childhood taught me was never show my emotions. Don’t make memories. Don’t count on other people. Don’t hope for the best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All that changed when I was adopted by Ryan and Whitney Kepler. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Begrudgingly I let them into my life, along with my new sister and a best friend I would lay down my life for. But giving up my heart and accepting love in return from Kelsea Harrison? It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the truth is? I’m not sure if I’m that strong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kelsea Harrison &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the very moment I met Nick Kepler I knew he would be the love of my life. Problem is I haven’t been able to convince him of that yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When our best friends get married, Nick and I spend a drunken night letting our walls down and losing all our inhibitions. In one moment I’m given everything I ever wanted. Then, in the blink of an eye it’s taken away from me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The question is, can I be strong for the both of us? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The answer? I have to be. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tobias Gamble knew from a young age precisely the kind of woman he was going to make his. She was not going to be like his mother. She was going to be like the mother he claimed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, she was going to be just right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when Toby returns to his hometown of Matlock, Kentucky and claps eyes on Adeline Forrester, he knows she’s the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, his brother Johnny has a new girlfriend. And Addie is her sister. Last, Toby would do nothing to hurt Johnny’s chance at happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby hangs around town to get to know the woman Johnny fell in love with. He also hangs around to get to know Addie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s fallen hard, and he knows the best thing for him—and Addie—is for him to leave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie Forrester is thrilled her sister Eliza found a good, solid man. Johnny Gamble is the salt of the earth. The best guy in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best except for his brother, Toby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby doesn’t know it, but Addie’s fallen hard too. He’s perfect, except for the fact that he’s hands off and it’s torture, being friends with Toby when she wants so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie also has a lot on her mind. She’s got bills to pay, her young son needs food, Christmas is coming and her job at the grocery store just isn’t cutting it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby is steering clear of Addie. Addie is steering clear of Toby. But everyone around them knows this is the slow burn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because just like Eliza and Johnny, Addie and Toby were made for each other. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Derek Tower has spent his life at war, first as a Green Beret and then as the owner of a private black-ops company, Cobra International Security. When a high-ranking US senator asks Cobra to protect his daughter, a midwife volunteering in Afghanistan, Derek’s gut tells him to turn the senator down. The last thing he wants to do is babysit an aid worker. But Jenna isn’t just another assignment. She’s also the younger sister of his best friend, the man who died taking bullets meant for him. There’s no way Derek can refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenna Hamilton doesn’t need a bodyguard, especially not one hired by her intrusive and controlling father. She knew the risks when she signed on to work in rural Afghanistan, and the hospital already has armed security. She also doesn’t need the distraction of a big, brooding operative skulking about, even if he is her late brother’s best friend—and sexy as hell. As far as she’s concerned, he can pack up his Humvee and drive into the sunset. And, no, nothing her hormones have to say about him will change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment his boots hit the ground in Afghanistan, Derek does his best to win Jenna over, posing as her brother so the two of them can spend time alone. Except that what he feels for her is anything but brotherly. Stolen moments lead to secret kisses—and an undeniable sexual attraction that shakes them both to the core. But events have been set into motion that they cannot escape. When a ruthless warlord sets his sights on Jenna, Derek will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even if it costs him his heart—or his life.</description>

  <description>Sometimes a single flame can ignite a love that lasts a lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milo Phillips knows the meaning of pain. Suffering through the most intense physical agony of his life, he’s confined to a hospital bed to bear it alone. More than once, he wishes he’d died in the explosion that melted and mangled his skin. Darkness consumes him, snuffing all the joy in his life and leaving an empty hole in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day, a flicker of light sneaks into his hospital room, driving away some of the hopelessness. For the first time in months, pain isn’t all he feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flicker’s name is Sara Foster, his new nurse. Milo just hopes that Sara can see past his scars. Because underneath, his heart has begun beating again just for her.</description>

  <description>I can look, but I can’t touch.&lt;br /&gt;As the enforcer of The Lost Boys MC, I am used to getting my hands dirty. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve always kept my emotions in check. &lt;br /&gt;It helps given the position I am in. &lt;br /&gt;When I was tasked with watching over our President’s sister, I was ready for it. &lt;br /&gt;What I wasn’t ready for, is how that beauty would pull at my heart. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve known Ella for years. &lt;br /&gt;After a horrible break up with her ex, all I wanted to do was protect her. &lt;br /&gt;But now, all I want is to bend her over and make her mine. &lt;br /&gt;I know I should resist her. &lt;br /&gt;But I think my heart has other plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is the first book of The Lost Boys MC.</description>

  <description>Abby&lt;br /&gt;I only have one love now—the home furnishings business I’m building into an empire. Maybe money and success can’t love me back, but they keep what’s left of my heart safe. One-night stands are my way of scratching the occasional itch I get for something more. And no one’s better for that than a sexy as sin hockey player I’ll never see again after one very hot night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luca &lt;br /&gt;I used to love two things: hockey and women. But now my nieces and nephew are my top priority, because I’m raising them after tragedy stole their parents. Somehow I balance single parenthood and my career as a forward for the Chicago Blaze. There’s no time for women, until I get knocked on my ass by Abby Daniels. She’s everything I’ve ever wanted, but her devastating past may end us before we even get started.</description>

  <description>It all started with a sexy selfie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texted to the wrong number. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oops.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my finest moment — but I have nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought I was no better, and I quote, than the &lt;i&gt;knuckle-dragging douche-bags she was never dating again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a stupid dare from a girl I’d met online, but since she’d given me a fake number, I didn’t feel bad that my interests were suddenly focused elsewhere — on the fiery and sharp-tongued, Peyton that I found myself sparring with over text for the rest of the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day, my case of mistaken identity came back to bite me in the banana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I strolled into the office, I was introduced to Peyton as the new client I needed to win over. &lt;i&gt;The Peyton&lt;/i&gt;, in case you're not tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let’s just say she had my &lt;i&gt; full&lt;/i&gt; attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brains? &lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty? &lt;i&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part? She hated me on sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear God, do I love a challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the games begin.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Opposites don't just attract... sometimes they BOOM!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valerie Dawson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I've ever wanted is to make my father proud. All he ever wanted was sons. I've never felt like I was enough… then everything changes when I'm assigned to audit the Broken Eagle's Motorcycle Shop and meet Rowan Pryor for the first time. The minute his eyes lock on mine, I know this gorgeous man is trouble. He's looking at me as if I'm his everything, his eyes telling me he's thinking of a thousand ways to get me dirty. And I like it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have plans for myself and none of them include some hot, motorcycle guy in a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rowan Pryor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I traded a broken past for a brotherhood I could count on. War changes people, bonds them together, so when our time in the Navy is served, I join my fellow SEALS in Nashville to help start up a motorcycle repair shop. A big city guy like me is enjoying a distraction free small town life. But then Valerie Dawson walks into the shop, wearing those nerdy glasses like it's her mission to steal my breath away and I know I’m in dangerous territory. She makes me feel things I never thought I could feel and I am determined to make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't believe in love at first sight... Until Valerie.</description>

  <description>Twyla Penn's first few days at her new job were going pretty well- right up to the moment a man in a ski mask pulled a gun on her and tried to toss her into the backseat of his car. Luckily, the hot cop she'd seen in the bar earlier showed up and saved her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jensen Reed never paid any attention to all the "boom" stuff his fellow officers talked about- until Twyla. With one look at the beautiful blonde with the soft brown eyes, he knew they were meant for each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He protected her once. Now he wants it to be a lifelong job. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Contradictions... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tall and short. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Inked and unmarked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Golden and porcelain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soft dreads and wild red. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dark and… darker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keeping more secrets than a teenage girl's diary, Harlow Cooper hides a lot behind her bubbly personality. College student and intern. Loyal friend and loving daughter. Fangirl and girly girl. Lover of strong coffee and even stronger margaritas. Former bartender and current… Well, let’s just say she’s suddenly in need of pasties and an industrial sized drum of glitter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quick with a smile and joke, people assume Kase Teo is all ego with a slacker follow-through. But lurking behind his hauntingly beautiful blue eyes is an ocean. Knowledge, quick wit, experience, pain… There are depths to Kase that most don’t see. If there’s one thing he’s learned, it’s that life’s all about appreciating the beauty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Kase, that means going after the redhead that’s set up residence in his mind. And his fantasies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now he needs her to see life’s more than just a best case scenario. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Warning: This book is intended for adults. It contains frequent adult language and situations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though it can be read as a standalone, it is STRONGLY recommended you read Hyde and Seek first.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00UZSTI28.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Skye is rock ‘n’ roll. She’s party all night, sleep all day. She’s get wild and be free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or she would be if she had the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not being so awkward would probably help, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the owner of a thriving dessert business, Piper spends her days at school and her nights elbow deep in batter and frosting. She’s confident her hard work and sacrifice will pay off as long as she stays focused and sticks to the plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Hyde is a workaholic with a jaded outlook on life. Surrounding himself with employees he considers his brothers, he long ago made the decision that his custom garage would be his focus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate, as it often does, has other ideas. Plus, a killer sense of humor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together by coincidence, the gruff mechanic and the sweet as sin baker have instant sparks. Suddenly, all of their carefully made plans have taken a giant freakin’ left turn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they do it on the back of a Harley. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Warning: This book is intended for adults. It contains frequent adult language and situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t try this at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least not without stretching first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe keep the sneakers on for traction, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is book one in a series, but each book will be a STANDALONE with a new couple. NO cliffhanger.***</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was my princess.&lt;br /&gt;I was her psycho.&lt;br /&gt;Two worlds colliding with a BOOM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a sh*tstorm brewing. Whispers. Rumbles. A rot—fueled by greed and protected by corruption—that’d seeped like sewage, eating away at everything it touched. The only people I trusted were my brother by blood, my brothers by patch, and the crazy Irish-Scottish bastard I did jobs for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was why, when the hot-as-hell blonde started trailing my brothers and me, I had to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Ophelia Kline was working with the enemy—playing me with lies from that damn mouth. Or maybe she was innocent—caught in the spread of toxic rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, she was &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;. And when push came to glock-in-the-face, I wouldn’t let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because all good relationships start with a BOOM and a little kidnapping… right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~&lt;br /&gt;This is a Happily Ever Alpha novel featuring crossover from the Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It can be read as a standalone, but it's recommended you read Until Nox first since a certain accented someone shows up often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 due to alllll the good things: Adult language. Adult situations. Biker hotties who work in the gray. And an OTT hero who knows what he wants when he gets hit by the BOOM.</description>

  <description>Bryson’s Steakhouse is the go-to place for the Mayson family to celebrate all their big occasions. As its owner, Mani has had a front row seat to the second generation of Maysons finding their boom. But he’s always on the outside looking in, and he doubts it’ll ever be his turn...until Vivian comes crashing into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian doesn’t think she has a lot in common with Mani. He owns a fancy restaurant, and she’s having a hard time finding a job. She’s searching for a cheap place to rent, and he has a beautiful house. Fast food drive-throughs are more her style, and Mani is all about gourmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Mani, these aren’t differences. They’re opportunities to give Vivian everything she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Mani is part of the Happily Ever Alpha World, inspired by the Until Series by Aurora Rose Reynolds.</description>

  <description>My best friend made damn sure I knew the rules. His sister was strictly off limits.&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KALI&lt;br /&gt;Growing up it was always the three of us. Me, my twin brother, Kyle, and our best friend, Aiden. We were inseparable all the way through high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I picture myself with Aiden from the first moment I laid eyes on him back when we were eight? Hell. Yes. I fell in love with his soul that day. But he was always more Kyle’s friend than mine. And Kyle made damn sure we both know the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was strictly off limits. Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now Kyle is gone. Dead from a freak accident. And Aiden is still here. Looking hot as hell in his grown-up body. Looking sexy AF with those tattoos all over his muscular chest. Sad and in need of comfort. Just like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AIDEN&lt;br /&gt;Every time Kyle caught me lusting after his twin sister, Kali, he reminded me of the rule. “You were my friend first.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get technical about it, I was Kali’s friend first, not Kyle’s. But that’s not how he saw it. One rule. That’s all we had between us. Just one. Stay away from my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these years I’ve honored that. I never broke his trust. Until now. Because he’s dead. He left us. And being with Kali is the only thing that makes the pain go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want Kali. I want to marry her, and have kids with her, and keep her in my bed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I want Kyle’s blessing too. And that’s something I’ll never get.</description>

  <description>Two years. That’s the amount of time I’ve wasted lusting after Wyatt Douglas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He had me the moment he roared up on his bike and flashed his charismatic smile my way. I wanted to jump on, wrap my arms around him, and ride off into the sunset. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then my brother introduced him as his friend and crushed my short lived happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, we work together at World Class Wrestling and our storylines are intertwined. I have a strict rule I’ve always adhered to: never mix business with pleasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with each moment we spend together, avoiding that carefully drawn line is becoming more difficult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s an ongoing rumble between my heart and my head. Which one will win out in the end? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*can be read as a standalone* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“Why haven’t we had sex?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jesse Gunn one of the biggest stars of World Class Wrestling voiced that million dollar question, yet again, I was stunned. After countless times of turning him down, I thought eventually he'd give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpectedly thrown together for a work project, my mind went to places I’d never allowed. Dirty places where sweaty, naked bodies take center ring and names are rasped out in the heat of the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my time is spent wondering if a certain part of him could possibly live up to his last name, distracting me from my full time job - as his boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I continue to keep things professional or will I give in and tussle? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tussle is a full length sports romcom.</description>

  <description>** A USA Today Bestselling Novel **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, we were in love. She was an up-and-coming superstar and I was the security professional hired to keep her safe. We fell hard and fast, no matter how much we tried to resist one another. But not everyone around us was happy about our relationship, and a string of lies and deceit destroyed what we once had. I moved on from her and didn’t look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’ve taken the helm of a nationally renowned protective services company, and I’m looking to rebrand my career. The newly crowned Jameson Force Security is moving from the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas to the mountainous steel town of Pittsburgh, and the last thing I have time for is to deal with my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a decade has passed since our split, but even a bruised and battered heart remembers its first love. So when Joslyn Meyers comes to me for help, I reluctantly agree to keep her safe from a terrifying stalker who keeps threatening her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the danger continues to intensify, it becomes clear that I’ll stop at nothing to protect the woman who turned her back on me all those years ago. Because one thing is certain—no matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise, Joslyn still has my heart.</description>

  <description>A second chance romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you fall for the boy next door?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea Norwood had the market on normal.&lt;br /&gt;Drama free life? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A single-mother who doubled as her confidant and partner in crime? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A neighbor and best friend she trusted more than anyone? Check.&lt;br /&gt;But that was until the day her mother remarried. The day that changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend's cousin, Liam Falcon, is sent to live with his aunt and uncle to clean up his act, Bea finds herself falling for the boy next door. With their hearts so infinitely entwined, Bea turns to Liam as her only escape from her new step-brother's daily torment at home. Bea thought their love could conquer anything. But she was wrong. Love was for fools, and she was the biggest fool of them all. When Liam left Lakeport, he took her heart with him, shattering the organ to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, Liam takes a trip back to Lakeport to visit his family, and to see HER.&lt;br /&gt;His first love.&lt;br /&gt;The girl who holds his heart.&lt;br /&gt;The same girl who shattered it six years ago without looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam is hell-bent on seeing Bea again after six years, but what he finds tears his heart in half. Bea Norwood is a shell of the girl he fell in love with. Underneath the baggy clothes, and pale skin, he knows she's still in there somewhere, he just needs to find her. &lt;br /&gt;Liam will stop at nothing to win his girl back, but sometimes, ignorance is bliss, and Liam isn't prepared for Bea's truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains themes of abuse. May cause triggers.</description>

  <description>From Audie Award winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Kylie Scott comes an irresistible new romance - available in audio first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a vicious attack leaves 25-year-old Clementine Johns with no memory, she's forced to start over. Now she has to figure out who she was and why she made the choices she did - which includes leaving the supposed love of her life, tattoo artist Ed Larsen, only a month before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed can hardly believe it when his ex shows up at his tattoo parlor with no memory of their past, asking about the breakup that nearly destroyed him. The last thing he needs is more heartache, but he can't seem to let her go again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should they walk away for good, or does their love deserve a repeat performance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 6 hours and 47 minutes&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Paisley &lt;br /&gt;I met Liam when I was sixteen years old. There was something about him that tempted me to break all the rules. I was enthralled by his bad boy ways, but I knew there was so much more to him—a side of Liam that he didn’t allow people to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little did I know, he’d save me on what could’ve been the worst day of my life. At that point, there was no going back. He was my everything. I felt safe in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until someone tried to kill me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam&lt;br /&gt;I was only seventeen years old when I met Paisley, and I haven’t been able to keep my eyes off her ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was everything I wasn’t, but that didn’t stop me from wanting her, from making her mine. I’d love and protect her with my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartel started gunning for her, and that was the worst decision they could have made. They’ll never know what hit them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;I’m no angel, and he’s definitely no saint. We’ve crossed paths on the way to hell, and now he thinks we’re going to enjoy the rest of the ride together...&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said no. &lt;strong&gt;He said yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned him down. &lt;strong&gt;He kicked in my door.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He told me to stay.&lt;/strong&gt; I ran as far as I could.&lt;br /&gt;I hate him. &lt;strong&gt;He adores me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m crazy. &lt;strong&gt;He’s worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to leave. &lt;strong&gt;He won’t let me go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a bitch. &lt;strong&gt;He loves me anyway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s a killer.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He says I’m strong, beautiful, talented.&lt;/strong&gt; I say he’s lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s doing everything he can to make me believe it. &lt;/strong&gt;I’m doing everything I can to resist him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He fights and f*cks as hard as I do&lt;/strong&gt;, and now...I think I might like him too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Shelli Adler has known what she wanted since she was eleven years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden Brooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Aiden has always had other ideas. After spending the early years of his life without his dad, hockey legend Lucas Brooks, Aiden is determined not to settle for anything less than true love. When he’s ready. Now he’s living the fast life of an NHL bachelor. He won’t give his heart to any one girl, but they can have his body—all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party to celebrate the start of the second half of the season was supposed to be no different from any other night. And when a stunning stranger approaches him, he can’t seem to keep his hands off her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, she’s gone, and he’s been traded to his dad’s former team, the Nashville Assassins. All of his professional dreams are coming true, but he can’t shake the memory of the girl from that last party. He wants to see her again. Though, after moving across the country—and without knowing her name—that dream seems like a puck destined to miss the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Shelli, her night with Aiden was everything she’d ever imagined it could be, and she’s sure it is all about to change for them. But for that to happen…he would have to know who she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dump was only the beginning. The Chase is worth waiting a lifetime for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lola Carradine isn't just rocking the stage, she's rocking Bo Bennett's world.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Gossip Thread&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; has recently heard rumors that actress-turned-singer, Lola Carradine, is reportedly dating Bo Bennett, the New Orleans Revelers' hottest new rookie. With her next album set to drop in less than two months, what Gossipers are dying to know is: is this the real deal or the latest publicity ploy from Camp Carradine?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#TheRookieandTheRockstar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Baseball News&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; has been following the developing story of rookie third baseman, Bo Bennett, and singer, Lola Carradine. With this being a crucial time in the young athlete's life, finally making it to the Big Leagues, we have to ask ourselves: is this the right move this early in his career or will the rocker be too much of a distraction?&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Bailey &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being the single mom of a beautiful five-year-old was hard. I’d struggled since the day I gave birth to my daughter when I was eighteen. So when we got the opportunity of a lifetime—to start over somewhere new—it was a no-brainer. We had to go. &lt;br /&gt;What I never expected was to find him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With one look, our whole world changed. Travis became everything to us. For once, we were carefree and happy. We had everything we’d always dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then things started happening... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Travis &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bailey came out of nowhere and changed my life completely. I’d never known what living was until her eyes connected with mine and my world imploded. My days now revolved around her and the beautiful little girl I loved as my own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bailey and her daughter were now my family, and I vowed to protect them at all costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I never expected was for someone to want to hurt Bailey. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If he ever tries to breathe the same air as Bailey and Gabby again—that’ll be the last thing he’ll ever try to do. By the time it’s over, he’ll consider Hell a welcome treat.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Solomon Sanders doesn’t have time to fall in love. Until a stunning, skittish, single mother forces him to pause and recognize just how empty and hollow his busy life has become.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, it’s been ingrained in Solo’s DNA to fight.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for what he believes is right.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for the people he loves.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for the traces of good in a place which tends to be filled with a variety of bad.&lt;br /&gt;Fight for survival, so at some point, his life will quiet down and find a normal pace.&lt;br /&gt;He wasn’t ready for the impact his secretive, shy, obviously out of place new neighbor was going to have on him. And never in a million years was he prepared to fall head over heels for her and her young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s facing the most important, and the hardest fight he’s ever fought… the battle to win Orley’s damaged heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Orley Vincent’s heart is full of fear, leaving no space for love. Until a big, brash, brawler of a man forces his way in and makes her realize facing her fears is the only way she can ever be free.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, Orley was groomed to believe she wasn’t good enough.&lt;br /&gt;She wasn’t the perfect daughter. Or student. Or girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;But, she has always been the best mother she could be to her daughter, Noble.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping Noble safe has always been the one thing she was determined to do, which ironically, is how she ended up on the wrong side of the tracks, living next door to an unlikely hero. Orley’s a woman on the run. She had no idea her frantic sprint was going to land her in the tattooed arms of a man ready to teach her how to fight for herself… and for love.</description>

  <description>Vinnie Gallo's the hottest rookie in professional football.&lt;br /&gt;He's a smooth-talker, good with his hands, and knows how to score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca Hernandez thinks she's immune to Vinnie's charms. She's not impressed by the glitz, glamour, or fame, but after a six month self-imposed break from men and sex, she feels her resistance slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will stop Vinnie from trying to get the girl—not a crazy stalker, Bianca's two older brothers, or the fear he's falling in love.</description>

  <description>A sexy single billionaire businessman. A YouTube star. And the hottest night of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw him, I thought he was too hot for his own good and too cocky to resist. The perfect rebound from my break-up from hell. So I threw my usual rules out the door and challenged him to an anonymous hook-up. No names, no strings attached. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left me aching in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise when I show up for the first day of my new job to find him leading the company's annual meeting. We lock eyes through the crowd of employees, all the intensity from our hook-up like a live wire between us. And then he embarrasses me on purpose. Dick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to keep this job and make it big. I won't let this arrogant hottie get to me or into my panties. But he is so powerful and sexy, that when he gets me in the elevator alone again, I know my plan is flawed.</description>

  <description>She has a head for business and a body for sin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a coach who knows how to use his equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither is looking for love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be easy, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be the most important game Kendall Wales and Hunter Owens have ever played where everything is on the line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one wrong play, they could lose it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the game clock doesn’t reach zero before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*A stand-alone novel that combines Kelly Elliott's &lt;i&gt;The Playbook&lt;/i&gt; and Kristin Mayer's &lt;i&gt;Trust Me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Getting in deep has never felt this good... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Commercial diving instructor Tara Hunter nearly lost everything in an accident that saw her medically discharged from the navy. With the help of the Warrior Fight Club, she’s fought hard to overcome her fears and get back in the water where she’s always felt most at home. At work, she’s tough, serious, and doesn’t tolerate distractions. Which is why finding her gorgeous one-night stand on her new dive team is such a problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former navy deep-sea diver Jesse Anderson just can’t seem to stop making mistakes—the latest being the hot-as-hell night he’d spent with his new partner. This job is his second chance, and Jesse knows he shouldn’t mix business with pleasure. But spending every day with Tara’s smart mouth and sexy curves makes her so damn hard to resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joining a wounded warrior MMA training program seems like the perfect way to blow off steam—until Jesse finds that Tara belongs too. Now they’re getting in deep and taking each other down day and night, and even though it breaks all the rules, their inescapable attraction might just be the only thing truly worth fighting for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kristen Proby Crossover Collection features a new novel by Kristen Proby and six by some of her favorite writers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristen Proby – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401054.Soaring_with_Fallon" title="Soaring with Fallon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soaring with Fallon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Bennett – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401055.Wicked_Force" title="Wicked Force" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;K.L.

  <description>My friends used to tell me ‘What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.’ Clearly, they lied because a few months later, I found out my one-night stand was pregnant.&lt;br /&gt; I couldn’t handle a baby. I was Griffin Rockwell, the best wide receiver the league had ever seen. But what choice did I have? My baby girl was coming whether I was ready for her or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke turned out to be an amazing woman and mother. For seven years, we were the MVP of co-parenting—and even better friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changed when tragedy struck our makeshift family and I was faced with the terrifying possibility of losing the one woman I was quickly realizing I couldn’t live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the height of my career and on the path to becoming the greatest of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keeping my family together, with Brooke by my side, might prove to be the hardest route of all.</description>

  <description>I'm making strides in the world of dirt late model racing. With back-to-back championships under my belt, I'm determined to win a third and be the youngest driver in history to do so. I'm going to make it happen. My career is my focus. That is until the ultimate distraction in the form of a redheaded bombshell drops into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know nothing about racing, but when my boss comes to me with a special assignment, I take it. Now, here I am traveling from city to city engrossed in this new world. I would never have dreamed that this project would lead me to new friendships and ultimately finding love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made a deal, our time together would expire, and we would part ways. The only problem with that is, I'm not so sure that's what I want anymore. She's pushing at my walls, and I'm trusting her, letting them fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a shame we put an end date on our time together. I knew I would fall for him, but I never dreamed that those feelings would run this deep. The plan was to walk away, that's what we agreed to, it's just going to be harder than I thought. I need a new plan one that helps me move on without him.</description>

  <description>After a bad decision lands me a role on a reality show, I expect it to be my big break as a TV star. Despite getting kicked off the first night, I land on my feet again when a talent agent who saw the show offers me an audition as back-up dancer for a popular rock band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this could be my stepping stone is exciting, but the real thrill is watching Brody bang on his drums every night. It’s a bad idea for a dancer to hook up with a band member, but after he kisses me, I can’t stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing the consequences was inevitable, and it only takes one scandalous mistake from my past to cause our complete destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad decision or not, I always manage to come out on top… until I don’t.</description>

  <description>Biker. Criminal. Bastard.&lt;br /&gt;Rourke Powers is all those things, and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say we come from different worlds is an understatement. &lt;br /&gt;I’m ambitious. Professional. I keep my nose clean and my reputation impeccable.&lt;br /&gt;No bad choices. &lt;br /&gt;No bad boys. &lt;br /&gt;The VP of the Ironwood Lords of Carnage? &lt;br /&gt;Definitely not part of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when fate slams us together, to protect someone we both care about&lt;br /&gt;It’s impossible to deny the heat between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever said that opposites attract? Well, they’re not wrong. &lt;br /&gt;He’s confident and cocky. &lt;br /&gt;Deliciously dangerous. Definitely doable.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt;He’s fire to my ice.&lt;br /&gt;Bad boy to my good girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, he’s damn near irresistible. &lt;br /&gt;But I will resist him. I have to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know from bitter experience, men in general can’t be trusted. &lt;br /&gt;Even the ones who look squeaky clean can harbor dark secrets underneath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Rourke? He doesn’t even try to hide his dangerous side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so tempted to give him my body. &lt;br /&gt;But I’ll never trust Rourke with my heart.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She left. &lt;br /&gt;Two words I can't really get out of my head. &lt;br /&gt;She left us. &lt;br /&gt;Three more words that make it that much worse. &lt;br /&gt;Three being another word I can't seem to wrap my mind around. &lt;br /&gt;Three kids under the age of six, and she left because she missed it. Because her dream had never been to have a family, no her dream had been to marry a rockstar and live the high life. &lt;br /&gt;Moving my recording studio to Seaside Oregon seems like the best idea in the world right now especially since Seaside Oregon has turned into the place for celebrities to stay and raise families in between touring and producing. It would be lucrative to make the move, but I'm doing it for my kids because they need normal, they deserve normal. And me? Well, I just need a break and help, that too. I need a sitter and fast. Someone who won't flip me off when I ask them to sign an Iron Clad NDA, someone who won't sell our pictures to the press, and most of all? Someone who looks absolutely nothing like my ex-wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's tall. &lt;br /&gt;That was my first instinct when I saw the notorious Trevor Wood, drummer for the rock band Adrenaline, in the local coffee shop. He ordered a tall black coffee which made me smirk, and five minutes later I somehow agreed to interview for a nanny position. I couldn't help it; the smaller one had gum stuck in her hair while the eldest was standing on his feet and asking where babies came from. He looked so pathetic, so damn sexy and pathetic that rather than be star-struck, I took pity. I knew though; I knew the minute I signed that NDA, the minute our fingers brushed and my body became insanely aware of how close he was—I was in dangerous territory, I just didn't know how dangerous until it was too late. Until I fell for the star and realized that no matter how high they are in the sky—they're still human and fall just as hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kristen Proby Crossover Collection features a new novel by Kristen Proby and six by some of her favorite writers: &lt;br /&gt;Kristen Proby – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401054.Soaring_with_Fallon" title="Soaring with Fallon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soaring with Fallon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Bennett – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401055.Wicked_Force" title="Wicked Force" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;K.L.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“What the f*ck have I done?” aren’t the first words you want to hear after a one-night stand. &lt;br /&gt;Yet that’s what he gave me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dallas Barnes is tall, dark, and handsome.&lt;br /&gt;He’s also scarred, rough, and broken down by burdens. &lt;br /&gt;A single dad. A widower. A lost soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found each other in the back of a dark pub.&lt;br /&gt;He brought the whiskey.&lt;br /&gt;I brought the bad decisions. &lt;br /&gt;He called it a mistake. &lt;br /&gt;I vowed never to speak to him again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That vow is broken with one test.&lt;br /&gt;Two pink lines have turned my life upside down. &lt;br /&gt;One night can change everything.</description>

  <description>Single-Dad&lt;br /&gt;Firefighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my divorce five years ago, these are the two labels I've identified with. Now, I'm ready for more. Ready to give dating a shot, even with an eight-year-old daughter and twenty-four hour shifts needing my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sydney has a snow-day and we have an epic malfunction in the kitchen, we decide to head to the breakfast joint we've frequented for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except today something is different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our normal waitress, Emma, isn't all baggy clothes and ducking her head to keep me from seeing her face. Today? Today I feel like I see her for the first time, and damned if our gazes don't ignite a heat I've only felt while on the job.</description>

  <description>Roman “Gamer” Power didn’t know what a good life was until he became a member of the Hawks MC and Talon took over as president. Happy from being needed with his skills on the computer, his life is content. He can even go without the woman he admires from afar. A woman he’s dreamed of having as his own for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the time to stand back waiting for her to heal is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Alexander’s world ended the day her husband died. All that keeps her going is the love of her kids and grandchildren. Happiness only makes itself known when her family is around. Then something changes. A certain biker, a certain young biker, shows her she’s not just a mother or grandmother. Instead, she’s something more to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an age gap she’s unsure of and her heart still torn, can Nancy finally be out gamed by Gamer?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Some rules are meant to be broken.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today Best Seller L. Wilder brings readers a new addition to the Satan's Fury Memphis series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Murphy's Law- Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Satan's Fury's sergeant-at-arms, it was my job to stay one step ahead. It was up to me to make sure the club was ready when things went awry. I had to anticipate our enemies' every move and plan accordingly. I couldn't let Murphy's Law bite me in the a**, so I created a set of rules to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The club comes first.&lt;br /&gt;* Always have your brother's back.&lt;br /&gt;* Don't make promises you can't keep.&lt;br /&gt;* Don't buy into other people's bullsh*t.&lt;br /&gt;* Never let your emotions rule you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they'd prepare me for anything, but I was wrong. Nothing could've prepared me for Riley Nichols--the farmer's daughter with coal-black eyes and a fiery tongue. She took me by surprise, mesmerizing me with her strength and tempting me with her innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make her mine, but having her meant breaking my rules--every last one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murphy is book four of the Satan's Fury MC- Memphis Chapter. While this book is a continuation of Riggs, Book 3 in the Satan's Fury Memphis series, it can be read as a standalone. Murphy is a full-length novel that is intended for mature audiences only due to the explicit language and violence. Contains no cheating and a swoon-worthy HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When tattoo artist, Liam O’Rourke, meets a hot new ink model promoting a sexy calendar at an LA tattoo convention, sparks fly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam admires Velvet like every red-blooded man in the convention center. The way she moves, her sexy pinup look and a body to die for; what man wouldn’t want that? She seems so strong and confident. But it’s the look in her eyes when she meets his that has him lightheaded. They hold a vulnerability that defy the sexy pose and call out to him. That look awakens a fierceness in him that has him wanting to protect her. She’s the beauty to his beast, and he can’t forget her. &lt;br /&gt;After an incredible night together, she vanishes, leaving him with nothing but questions, only to reappear in the last place he expects to find her. She’s gorgeous and irresistible, but she’s also hiding something from him. Liam must decide if she’s worth the risk if he’s going to save her from her past or lose her forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Velvet comes from a family of con artists. She grew up learning all their scams. When she was fourteen, her mother forced her into traveling from town to town, with Velvet playing the leading lady in the longest running con her mother ever pulled. &lt;br /&gt;She’s fought to put all that behind her, until she crosses paths with the one man who left an indelible mark on more than her skin. Velvet remembers Liam, but fortunately he doesn’t recognize her, because there’s something he doesn’t know and she can’t risk him ever finding out. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"Stryker" &lt;br /&gt;I’m a drifter. &lt;br /&gt;A man born to ride through this world alone. &lt;br /&gt;There used to be a time when I thought I was the rescuing type. I enlisted in the Marines and made it my duty—I was going to save lives. &lt;br /&gt;I was going to be a true American hero. &lt;br /&gt;But God had another plan. &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe Satan did. &lt;br /&gt;For everything I touch finds mortality. &lt;br /&gt;I’m no hero. &lt;br /&gt;I’m nothing. &lt;br /&gt;I’m a veteran biker, a former nomad who survived war only to live in hell. &lt;br /&gt;Now I ride with the Satan’s Knights of Brooklyn and I’m drifting into a different kind of chaos. &lt;br /&gt;The kind that revolves around a pretty girl with intoxicating green eyes. &lt;br /&gt;A girl who has the power to turn me inside out. &lt;br /&gt;A girl who doesn’t need anyone to rescue her because she’s her own savior. &lt;br /&gt;Until she’s not. &lt;br /&gt;But a man plagued by war and the devil inside him can never be her hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina Spinelli &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong. Independent. Fierce. &lt;br /&gt;They are the three things I strived to be. &lt;br /&gt;But sometimes being successful can be lonely. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a girl just wants to be a girl and have someone take care of her. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe even love her. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the strong become vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt;Or worse, the victor becomes the victim. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we lose control or in my case it’s stripped from you. &lt;br /&gt;Defeated. Broken. Haunted. &lt;br /&gt;They are the three things I have become. &lt;br /&gt;In my darkest hour I admit defeat. &lt;br /&gt;In my darkest hour I need one person. &lt;br /&gt;I need him. &lt;br /&gt;Stryker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***NOTE:Contains explicit sexual situations, violence, sensitive subjects, offensive language, and mature topics. Recommended for age 18 years and up. ***</description>

  <description>Maxon Chambers has a way of stealing all the attention. &lt;br /&gt;All my affection, and all my dreams. &lt;br /&gt;What I needed to remember was he’d stolen my good judgment and my virginity, too. &lt;br /&gt;When he broke up with me, I ran across the country and swore I’d never return to Broadshire Rim. &lt;br /&gt;But here I am, thirteen years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxon is all grown up.&lt;br /&gt;Sexier than sin and more tempting than ever. &lt;br /&gt;A detective on the Charleston force, he lives on the outside of safety, devoted to protecting the people of his city.&lt;br /&gt;But with the way he’s looking at me now? I’m pretty sure what needs protecting is my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we mend the pieces of us? Or will he leave my heart shattered forever . . .</description>

  <description>A Jamie Begley Anthology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAVEN SENT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There wasn’t anything Shade didn’t know about his wife, or so he thought. When another man wanted Lily, it didn’t come as a surprise. What did was that she hadn’t told him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His “Angel” had been sent from heaven just for him, not for another who was trying to steal what was his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lessons had to be learned the hard way and “when you burn, you learn” was his favorite lesson to teach.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CHASING RAINBOWS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ice had never believed in happily ever after … until he fell in love with Grace. He had put a ring on her finger, trying to tie her to him before she came to her senses and realized there was nothing redeeming about him. So, he wasn’t surprised that their marriage was on the rocks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be chasing rainbows, trying to find the man she believed he was, but rainbows never lasted, and Ice had never pretended to be anything but what he was—a cold-blooded Predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t realize you don’t have to chase after something that’s already been caught.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HALO FOR THREE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer and Jonas were on the hunt for a woman to share. However, either they couldn’t agree on the right woman, or she wanted no part of being in a ménage. That they found Mika on Valentine’s Day gave them hope that they had finally found the woman that they could spend the rest of their lives with … until she disappeared the next day, leaving them with an empty bed and no way to find her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might have escaped for now, believing she had gotten off scot-free, but the bounty hunters were determined to catch their fleeing third. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not know it yet, but some halos were made to be shared.</description>

  <description>I’m a full-time single dad to three daughters and CFO at Cloverleigh Farms. I don’t have time to fall in love—I’m too busy trying to run a business, keep the red socks out of the white laundry, and get the damn pillowcases on without owing a dollar to the swear jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Frannie Sawyer is beautiful and sweet, but she’s twenty-seven, the boss’s daughter, and my new part-time nanny—which means she’s completely off-limits. It’s bad enough I can’t stop fantasizing about her, what kind of jerk would I be if I acted on the impulse to kiss her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Exactly the kind of jerk you’re thinking.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I’m worse than that—because I didn’t stop with a kiss, and now I can’t stay away. She makes me feel like myself again. She reminds me what it’s like to want something just for me. She’s everything I ever needed, but nothing I ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a former Marine. I should have had the strength to resist her from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t. And now I have to choose between the life I want and the life she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it means giving her up.</description>

  <description>Nomad biker: a solitary life, riding from place to place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flux once wore the Insurgents MC patch and his territory was Colorado. Now his bottom rocker reads Nomad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The open road is Flux's therapy and facing a 1500 pound bull in the rodeo ring is the way he blocks out the memories. One-night stands, booze and plenty of weed have done a damn good job at keeping his heart locked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he meets a sassy barrel rider. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The golden hair vixen runs rings around him faster than she rides her horse in the arena, and he can't keep away from her. For the first time since the unspeakable tragedy happened, something stirs inside him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he has a long iceberg of guilt that he doesn't want to get rid of. He's chosen to live with it as a reminder of what has happened. Couple that with a bunch of inner demons that don't play nice and he's nothing but a shell of who he once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Haves hasn't known anything except the discipline of practice. Touted as one of the best barrel riders to hit the rodeo circuit, Maggie doesn't have time for anything that will veer her off the pro rodeo trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rugged, tatted and muscular Flux is a very big distraction.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention complicated beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flux has lived on the wild side most of his life, whereas Maggie has always played it safe. She knows the biker is danger in leather, but she's drawn to him like a moth to a flame. Something about him keeps luring her, and she's willing to take a chance on love with this imperfect man even if it destroys her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Maggie be the one to show Flux that he deserves to live again ... and forgive himself, or will his demons devour her before he throws her away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can two unlikely people find love in the midst of so much darkness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nomad Biker series are standalone romance novels. This is Flux's story. This book contains violence, abuse, strong language, and steamy/graphic sexual scenes. HEA. No cliffhangers. The book is intended for readers over the age of 18.</description>

  <description>When ER nurse Nora Sellers is hurt in a hospital scuffle, firefighter Zach Walker blames himself. Blaming himself is nothing new. He’s been blaming himself for years for the trauma his baby sister endured as a teenager. Though with his happy–go–lucky attitude no one would know it. He’s good at his job, he’s a good brother, and a good friend, but Zach decided long ago he wasn’t husband and father material. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even so, when Zach learns Nora is a single mother with a house that needs his help, he can’t walk away. After a few days with Nora and her ten month old son, he knows he doesn’t want to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But Nora’s wary. She learned at a young age that the only person she can count on is herself. Now with a baby, a job, and a fixer–upper house, the last thing Nora wants is a sexy firefighter, making her heart flutter. But Zach is more than what he seems, and the more she gets to know him the harder he is to resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She’s been brave all her life. Can she be brave one more time and take a chance of a lifetime with her heart? </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; My boyfriend dumped me on February 13th. How lucky, right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries, I have my revenge planned. He's with another woman and my plans are going to be &lt;i&gt;'shattering.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until a cop stops me. And not only does he stop me from what is probably a felony, &lt;i&gt;he makes my heart skip a beat and makes me forget how to breathe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I know it I'm spilling everything to him. He keeps me out of jail... but not out of trouble. He has a wicked idea to get back at my newly dubbed ex...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get married.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's right. Steal my ex's thunder by getting married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, there are worse things than having a one night thing and saying "I do" to a good looking cop with a killer smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the ring is on my finger and that first night of wedded bliss comes to an end, my new husband has to go work... and I'm left to ask: &lt;b&gt;now what?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey darlin' ... this is a 40,000 word insta-love, full length, HEA romance novel.  &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>COMING SOON &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had secrets that were drowning me, and my worst fear was he was going to get&lt;br /&gt;tired of waiting for me to put my big girl panties on and reveal the biggest one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shiloh&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My life started out with a tragedy—the death of my mother.&lt;br /&gt;But I had something no other infant had, six amazing men. My father and his brothers in arms raised me and gave me the best life any kid could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in the loving arms of the Wounded Souls, and each and every one of them protected and loved me beyond measure. Even when I lost two of the most important people in my life, the Souls never let me fall.&lt;br /&gt;After Dad met and married the best woman I had the pleasure of knowing, she and her flock, also wonderful women, gave me the feminine balance I needed in a life of soldiers turned bikers. They taught me to rise to every challenge and always be true to myself.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere, I lost sight of that on the way to my aspirations to make my mark.&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with a man who would die for me, adored me, and would do anything for me, should have been the happiest time of my life. So why was I hiding him?&lt;br /&gt;Could I really have it all? Or would my obsession with being everything and having it all mean I would lose the one person who meant everything?&lt;br /&gt;Then there was my ghost. Having him and his promise not to leave me was both a blessing and a curse. He knew all my secrets, and he also knew how to press my buttons.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The danger of Rogue is a distant memory, and the kids of the Wounded Souls are all grown up. The club princess has big dreams and even bigger secrets. Will she keep her dreams alive and keep the love of her prince?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A laird's daughter kidnaps a Highlander—and loses her heart… in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands' new historical romance...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Evina Maclean has heard much about Rory Buchanan's skill as a healer. What she hasn't heard is how good the brawny Highlander looks bathing in a waterfall. But Evina can't afford the distraction, for her ailing father urgently needs care. Only when she's rendered Buchanan unconscious and dragged him back to her family's castle does the truth emerge—it's not Rory she's kidnapped but his brother Conran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ladies try to ensnare Conran with flattery. Evina hits him over the head with the hilt of her sword to save her kin—and Conran likes the spirited redhead all the more for it. He's learned enough from his brother to heal Evina's father, but there are other dangers swirling around the Maclean clan. And while the beautiful, independent lady has sworn not to marry, this wrong Highlander may be just the right man for her.</description>

  <description>Waiting for Willa &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes the newest installment in her beloved Big Sky Series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Max Hull left Cunningham Falls a long time ago. Thanks to his killer instincts and business smarts, he’s come back to town richer than anyone’s wildest imagination. Now he’s closer to his family, living in his dream home, and at the top of his career—it sure looks like he has it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All but one thing. And she’s not interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willa Monroe and Max were childhood sweethearts. She daydreamed about their wedding day and named their children, but Max’s dreams were bigger than her. After high school, he left her behind without another word. Now, Willa is a single mother and a successful business owner, and the heartbreak of losing Max was a very long time ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s moved on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when he walks into her shop and back into her life, suddenly it feels like no time has passed at all. He’s as handsome as ever, and more charming than she remembered. Once he makes friends with her son and turns his attention on her, how long will she be able to resist him? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And does she really want to? Sometimes you do get a second chance at first love. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Arizona Vengeance is killing it on the ice. But one player can’t seem to keep his eye on the puck—all thanks to the woman he just married to save her life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Find your next hockey hero in Sawyer Bennett’s Arizona Vengeance series.”—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jill Shalvis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; My name is Dax Monahan and hockey is my passion. And if you want to succeed in this sport you have to bust your ass 24/7. I’ve never had a hard time focusing on my career, but when my past comes knocking, no amount of training can prepare me for what lies on the other side of the door.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Regan Miles was always like a sister to me. When a shared tragedy brings us face to face after several years, I’m shocked to see just how much she’s changed. Gone is the shy, awkward little girl that always used to chase me and her brother around. Instead, I’m faced with a gorgeous woman who makes it damn hard to concentrate on anything but her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, she’s in trouble, and the only way out is to get married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I surprise myself when I tell her to marry me. Order her, actually. And most shocking of all, she doesn’t even hesitate before saying yes.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; So it’s settled. We’re getting hitched and she’s moving to Arizona with me.  All platonic, of course.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The catch?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I never knew I’d fall so hard for my best friend’s little sister.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Arizona Vengeance series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Sawyer Bennett can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BISHOP&lt;br /&gt; ERIK&lt;br /&gt; LEGEND&lt;br /&gt; DAX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;And don’t miss her Carolina Cold Fury novels:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ALEX&lt;br /&gt; GARRETT&lt;br /&gt; ZACK&lt;br /&gt; RYKER&lt;br /&gt; HAWKE&lt;br /&gt; MAX&lt;br /&gt; ROMAN&lt;br /&gt; LUCAS&lt;br /&gt; VAN&lt;br /&gt; REED&lt;br /&gt; MAREK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Love Hurts series features sexy standalone novels:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SEX IN THE STICKS&lt;br /&gt; JILTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the Sugar Bowl series is one treat you’ll want to read in order:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SUGAR DADDY&lt;br /&gt; SUGAR RUSH&lt;br /&gt; SUGAR FREE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I am not okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen months ago, my life was turned upside down when the plane I was piloting went down. Injured and trapped in the wreckage, I had to watch my fiancée die a painfully slow death, which is something that can really mess with your head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, I’ve had little desire to do much of anything. Except play hockey, that is. Because that is the one place where the bad memories are banished and I can escape my pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But off the ice, I’m spiraling out of control. Losing the grip on my life and putting myself and my career in danger. Now, thanks to a string of bad decisions, I’ve been ordered to complete therapy in order to stay on the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? Nora Wayne, my beautiful and somewhat unconventional therapist. I can’t buy into the brand of happy clappy crap this woman is feeding me. What could she possibly understand about the type of loss that I’ve suffered? How does she know anything about finding happiness after losing the most important person in your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, I’ve got a lot to learn, and she’s just the person I need to break through those walls I’ve erected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not okay.&lt;br /&gt;But for the first time in a long time, I know that I will be.</description>

  <description>Try to forget.&lt;br /&gt;It's easier said than done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past—violently haunts my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;My present—belongs to an MC. My brothers, my support, my family, my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if you left someone behind?&lt;br /&gt;You failed them.&lt;br /&gt;And set in motion a series of events no one could have predicted.&lt;br /&gt;But in deserting him, you found her.&lt;br /&gt;A constant. A guiding light. A connection that can't possibly not be right.&lt;br /&gt;Or is it? &lt;br /&gt;This story isn’t just two souls finding their connection—it’s lust, treachery, misery, and brutality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vengeance—will thrill you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will I be able to gain my acceptance?</description>

  <description>Enormous, commanding, and hotter than sin, Copper is the only man Shell has ever wanted. Even as a young teen, when it was impossible and taboo to capture the attention of a grown man, she longed for him. For years, Shell clung to the dream of turning eighteen and finally being noticed by the Hell’s Handlers’ rough and gruff president. But the universe had other plans, and she was forced to make a horrible choice. A choice that altered the course of her life forever, sealing her fate and ensuring the dream of being Copper’s ol’ lady would never materialize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years his junior. Daughter of his MC’s former president. Single mother whose deadbeat sperm donor doesn’t provide an ounce of support. Loved as a younger sister by every man in the club. The list of reasons goes on for Copper to stay away from Shell. Problem is, he’s been hot for her for years. Copper finally gets some relief when she moves out of Tennessee, but once she’s back, all those reasons to keep his distance grow weaker by the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unable to fight against his own judgment any longer, Copper finally claims Shell for his own. But once again the universe steps in, revealing secrets with the power to destroy them both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shell will do anything for Copper, even tear out her own heart and confront the most agonizing parts of her past. But will she be too late to save her dream? Will she be too late to save Copper?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Chandler Moon&lt;/b&gt;’s career as a defensemen for the IceCats is on fire. However, his marriage has gone up in flames… literally. He’s resigned himself to the single life and being the best dog dad he can be, but he still holds out hope that one day he’ll find “The One.” So, imagine his surprise when he runs into “The One Who Got Away.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amelia Justice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His best friend’s baby sister.&lt;br /&gt;AKA: “The One Who Is Totally Off-Limits.”&lt;br /&gt;Amelia is broken. The punches that life, and her ex-husband, have thrown at her have her down for the count. She’s cut herself off from her family and friends as she works to rebuild her self-esteem and her spirit. Hidden away in a small town, she never expects to reconnect with “The One She Should Have Chosen.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chandler is so much more than he was in college: more handsome, more muscular, more tattooed… It was supposed to be a casual fling while Amelia and Chandler worked to put the pieces of their lives back together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as every good hockey player knows, a rebound can turn into one hell of a goal.</description>

  <description>It took one night with her to know she was my forever.&lt;br /&gt;It took one minute for me to climb out of bed and drive away from her.&lt;br /&gt;It’s taken me three years to confess that leaving her behind was the biggest mistake of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t stop until she knows what she means to me. I’ll convince her to listen to her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took one night for all of my dreams to come true.&lt;br /&gt;It took one morning, waking up alone, for those same dreams to come crashing down around me.&lt;br /&gt;It’s taken me three years to confess that night changed me forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says this time is different, but how do I open my heart up to a man who’s already ripped it to shreds?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's used to getting what he wants... but she’s going to make him work for it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Knight is a closer. Be it a real estate deal or the woman of his choice, everything he wants is his for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy and irresistible, a wink, a smile, or a handshake always seals the deal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until everything unravels around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Ashley Easton’s social climbing mother married into the Knight family, Ashley knew better than to get involved with sexy, trouble making Sebastian Knight but their attraction is undeniable, their chemistry intense, and in a moment of weakness, she turns to him, a mistake that cost her her home and her family. After she was sent away, she swore she’d never come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian never expected to see Ashley, the one woman he’s never been able to get over, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she walks back into his life at the worst possible time, more beautiful than ever, he’s ready for a second chance. She’s sassy and sexy everything he’s ever desired. And she’s back for good. Except Ashley wants nothing to do with the playboy who broke her heart. Too bad his sex appeal makes it harder and harder to keep him at arm’s length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Knight might have a talent for sealing the deal but this is one game he’s going to have to work to win.</description>

  <description>Bennett Fox walked into my life on one hell of a crappy Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was late for the first day at my new job—a job I’d now have to compete for even though I’d already worked &lt;i&gt;eight years&lt;/i&gt; to earn it, because of an unexpected merger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I lugged my belongings up to my new office, a meter maid wrote me a parking summons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’d ticketed a long line of cars—except for the Audi parked in front of me, which happened to be the same make and model as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed, I decided to &lt;i&gt;regift&lt;/i&gt; my ticket to the car that had evaded a fine. Chances were, the owner would pay it and be none the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, I &lt;i&gt;accidentally&lt;/i&gt; broke the windshield wiper while slipping the ticket onto the car’s window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my day couldn’t get any worse.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things started to perk up when I ran into a gorgeous man in the elevator. We had one of those brief moments that only happened in movies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You know the deal…your body lights up, fireworks go off, and the air around you crackles with electricity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His heated stare left me flush when I stepped off the elevator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe things here wouldn’t be so bad after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I walked into my new boss’s office and met my competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gorgeous man from the elevator was now my nemesis. His heated stare wasn’t because of any mutual attraction. It was because he’d seen me vandalize his car. And now he couldn’t wait to annihilate his rival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a fine line between love and hate—and we shouldn’t cross it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We shouldn’t&lt;/i&gt;—but straddling that line could be so much fun.</description>

  <description>The list of things I hate is short. Not even my soon-to-be ex-husband is on that list. Nope. I save only the worst of the worst, the crème de la crème, the absolute I cannot even for this list . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Black coffee&lt;br /&gt;2. Rude people&lt;br /&gt;3. Nathaniel Bradley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why when my father informs me that he’s making Nathaniel Bradley his new business partner, and in turn, my boss, I flip out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. He’s an annoying know-it-all. &lt;br /&gt;2. He calls me a spoiled princess every chance he gets. &lt;br /&gt;3. He disapproves of everything I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go into this knowing I’ll hate every second in his presence. Except the longer he’s around, the more I find myself staring at his lips and remembering the one time they were on mine. I randomly find myself looking at his hands and wondering how they’d feel on my skin. &lt;br /&gt;I try to snap out of it, but I guess I’m not as smart as I thought I was. No matter how many times I remind myself of the times I’ve practically thrown myself at him and he’s pushed me away, I keep falling little by little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d always heard that it was a bad idea to mix business with pleasure and if that’s the case, this thing with Nathaniel has demise written all over it.</description>

  <description>A new series from the author of the Moonshine Task Force Series! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurel Springs, AL is about to be hotter than a mid-August thunderstorm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Moonshine Task Force is absorbed into a new entity, Laurel Springs Emergency Response Team (LSERT) new faces come to town, new love is born, old love is found again, and there’s a plethora of drama and romance happening all over the tri-county area. LSERT puts police, firefighters, nurses, doctors, K-9 handlers, and EMT’s all in harm’s way as they work to keep the area safe from any threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When emotions are high, passions ignite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come with me, back to Laurel Springs, in what's sure to be a wild ride!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ransom Thompson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I’ve wanted two things - to be a member of the Moonshine Task Force and to be the man Stella Kepler can’t live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One out of two isn’t bad, or so I tell myself. Being the only K-9 handler for The MTF presents its own share of obstacles, but me and Rambo? We make it work. Life is status quo, until I’m called in to help with what appears to be a hostage situation and Stella is right in the middle of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my one chance, and I’m not going to blow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stella Kepler&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I’m stuck in an examination room holding a hurt woman and a man with a gun, I do the only thing I can. I sneak out, call 911 and hope help comes quickly. It does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the form of Ransom Thompson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and I have known each other since we were babies. Our mother’s are friends, our dad’s work together, and we’ve always been friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, the last few months I’ve started to notice things. How mature he is, how alpha he can be, the chiseled six-pack, and the abundance of ink spreading across his body. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I offer to cook him dinner for saving me, neither one of us know how that one moment will change the course of the rest of our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Kleypas delivers a scintillating tale of a beautiful, young widow who finds passion with the one man she shouldn't...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although beautiful young widow Phoebe, Lady Clare, has never met West Ravenel, she knows one thing for certain: he's a mean, rotten bully. Back in boarding school, he made her late husband's life a misery, and she'll never forgive him for it. But when Phoebe attends a family wedding, she encounters a dashing and impossibly charming stranger who sends a fire-and-ice jolt of attraction through her. And then he introduces himself...as none other than West Ravenel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire...not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn't bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She's the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the devil's daughter knows...</description>

  <description>We were destined.&lt;br /&gt;But time and fate are not on our side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My president—her blood brother.&lt;br /&gt;My patch—so close I can taste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, I have to choose. Is there really a choice?&lt;br /&gt;My club or the girl.&lt;br /&gt;This woman shines brightly. She's adored, worshiped, and cherished by everyone, not only me. I'm just the unlucky prospect who fell for her.&lt;br /&gt;But we're complicated. I want my patch, but I can't have her and it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story isn't only about a man fighting to have both—it’s secrets, battles, defection, and scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayal—it’s imminent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will we deal with our sufferance?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She brought light into my world of shadows.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today Best Seller L. Wilder brings readers a new addition to the Satan's Fury Memphis series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The club was at war, fighting an unknown enemy, and as Satan Fury's new enforcer, I was determined to do my brothers proud- no matter what the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Carpenter was a distraction I didn't need nor want. My focus should've been on the club and our latest adversary, but she was a temptation I couldn't resist.

  <description>Fate. &lt;br /&gt;Destiny. &lt;br /&gt;Whatever you wanted to call it, Macy Caldwell was mine.&lt;br /&gt;She had a chance to get out of this town, but she refused to take it. &lt;br /&gt;She was going to give up everything for me. &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t worth that kind of sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;In order to save her, I had to break her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The night Nash Masters broke my heart was the catalyst for the ruin that came after. &lt;br /&gt;All these years later, he was fighting for my forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;He had no idea I was the one who needed his.&lt;br /&gt;The truth didn’t always set you free. &lt;br /&gt;They said love conquered all, but this was war. &lt;br /&gt;And everything worth having was worth fighting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; She was the light to my darkness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today Best Seller L. Wilder brings readers a new Satan's Fury series that is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Memphis, Tennessee, Satan's Fury MC had become the most notorious MC in the city. That recognition hadn't come easy. While people were visiting Graceland and walking down on Beale Street, my brothers and I were at war, fighting rival MCs and gangs who were trying to take control of our territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had staked our claim, but when a new threat arrived, everything we had worked for would be put in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenadee Brooks was a nurse, trying to save lives and make a difference in the world. The moment I saw her, it wasn't just her beauty that caught my eye. It was the light that burned deep inside of her that drew me in. I longed for it, and with each moment I spent with her, the more determined I became to make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she was pulled into my world, saw the life that I lived, would that light I craved still burn bright or would it disappear forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blaze is book one of the Satan's Fury MC- Memphis Chapter. This full-length standalone novel is intended for mature audiences only due to the explicit language and violence. Contains no cheating and a swoon-worthy HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>
