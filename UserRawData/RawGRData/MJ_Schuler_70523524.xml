  <description>&lt;b&gt; My dream of becoming prima ballerina is dead. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dropped by the Royal Ballet, I return home to my empty house in Cornwall with nothing but ghosts, and memories of a past I am desperate to forget. &lt;br /&gt;It takes months of depression before I pull myself out of the bleakness and attempt to start living again. With a new job as an assistant to the wealthy but elusive Sachov family, I find myself caught up in a tangled web of desire, pain and sexual awakening that will either destroy me entirely or bring me back to life. &lt;br /&gt;My name is Rose, and I am their muse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Warning: This is a dark story that contains suicide, self-harm and other topics that may be triggering. Read at your own discretion.***</description>

      <![CDATA[I found the first book a bit slow winded and was looking forward to reading the second book as I had a feeling it was going to be more about the mc than Cade and Indy. Brothers in Arms was a much better mc book as it was actually about the Kings of Mayhem club. Including angst between other clubs...]]>

  <description>When a King loves &lt;br /&gt;He loves hard &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CADE &lt;br /&gt;I’ve loved her since we were five years old. &lt;br /&gt;We grew up side by side. &lt;br /&gt;Two kids tied together by the Kings of Mayhem Motorcycle Club. &lt;br /&gt;But I broke us. &lt;br /&gt;I broke her. &lt;br /&gt;So, she fled. &lt;br /&gt;Now she’s back after twelve long years. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m going to show her all the reasons why we should be together and make her forget all the reasons why we shouldn’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;INDY &lt;br /&gt;I’m back in town but only because I have to be. &lt;br /&gt;I’m here to help my mom bury my father. &lt;br /&gt;And the sooner we get it done, the better. &lt;br /&gt;Because I want to see Cade as much as I want a hole in the head. &lt;br /&gt;He broke me once—no, he broke my everything— and I’ll be damned if I’ll let him do it again. &lt;br /&gt;Get in and get out. That is the plan. &lt;br /&gt;But you know what they say about best-laid plans. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It's supposed to go like this. Boy meets girl, they fall madly in love with each other, battle some shit in their way, and after conquering the challenge, they ride off to their happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;But, not one fairytale, or love story tells you that after that ride, life happens. We had our story, and we were supposed to live happily in our bubble forever. After one check-up, our bubble burst and reality started to invade. And now, facing the unsure road of IVF treatment, we have to be stronger than ever. Once again, we must go into battle for our happily ever after. Taking that first step was easy. Staying on this road is harder than we thought.&lt;br /&gt;And now, with unexpected obstacles in the way, it’s not a question of if the IVF will succeed. It’s will we be strong enough to stay together and reach for the stars?</description>

  <description>It started with an invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masquerade ball, the ultimate fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept was fascinating, and surprisingly simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear a mask and forget who you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did just that…maybe a little too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about that night gave me a false sense of bravery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met the most beautiful man, masked and delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempting as hell, and as naughty as they come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His touch left me breathless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one passion filled encounter and I’ll never see him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No harm done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new gynecologist walked into the exam room, I look up to see that same gorgeous face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time, he’s the doctor, and I’m the patient.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s been broken by life. He’s always had it easy. Can they trust each other enough to be the fix they both need?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wonder if there was something wrong with me, but there was &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; wrong with me. I’m a happy, well-adjusted, laid-back guy, or so I always thought. The reality, though, is I’ve been coasting through life, not thinking or feeling, just &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until everything goes wrong, and Emi comes crashing into my life in the worst way possible. Yet for all the drama, angst, and heartache she brings with her, she’s also shown me what it means to be human—to feel, love, and hurt. She’s taught me what it meant to be alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s so fragile, yet she’s also the strongest person I know—a true survivor. She’s been to hell and back but wakes up every morning ready to fight another day. &lt;br /&gt;And when tragedy strikes and my perfect world falls apart, she’s the one helping me pick up the pieces. Yet each time she needs me to be there for her, she pushes me away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I refuse to just walk away. She’s taught me that real life isn’t easy, and if something’s worth wanting, it’s worth fighting for.</description>

  <description>What’s the saying: keep your friends close and your enemies closer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I’m about to find out just how difficult that really is. I might have my best friend back but his safety and that of my chosen family depends on me doing something I vowed never to do. &lt;br /&gt;Join Camden’s crew. &lt;br /&gt;Thing is, you don’t turn down the leader of Hackney’s Hackers and then get a second chance without forfeiting something in return. The relationships I was just starting to build, is that too high of a price? &lt;br /&gt;Sonny with his joking nature and dimples. &lt;br /&gt;Ford with his mysterious dominance and protective instinct. &lt;br /&gt;Eastern with his unyielding loyalty and feeling of home. &lt;br /&gt;This term at Oceanside Academy, my sanity will be pushed to the limit as I walk the fine line between friend and foe. All I know is this better be worth it because I’m about to learn something important about myself. I was happy being a delinquent, but a reject…? Not so much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Reject is book two of this new gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy trilogy for 17+ readers and contains foul language and sexual scenes**  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Reject is book two of this new gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy trilogy for 17+ readers and deals with adult themes.

  <description>Someone wants me dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, my link to Spirit is dying. Why? Because Exos has been taken by a new enemy. Now I have to rely on my other elements to find my missing link before it’s too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I need a guard to protect me while I learn how to defend myself. No big deal. Master the elements, find my lost Spirit, and identify the bad guy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except Titus is tired of playing by the rules of others. &lt;br /&gt;Vox just wants to be friends. &lt;br /&gt;Sol is pissing everyone off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Cyrus, well, he’s a force of nature and very much in charge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d better solve this puzzle quickly before my heart starts making choices on my behalf. Because all these fae are beautiful, cunning, and perfect in their own ways. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how can I feel complete without my Spirit? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The hunt is on, and whoever is out to hurt me and mine will pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a medium burn reverse harem paranormal romance, and book two of the Elemental Fae Academy trilogy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; My one piece of advice: Never kiss a stranger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I kind of kissed this sexy man at the bar on a dare once, and it turns out he's a Royal Fae destined to be my mate. Now I've been dragged to the Elemental Fae Academy to control the powers I unlocked that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kissing? Yeah, that won't happen again. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, I kind of kissed Titus, too. And well, now, I'm in a world of trouble. I keep burning things down, flooding dorms, and I've attracted the campus mean girl brigade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fae Realm is a nightmare come to life. Truly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are dreams here, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they're in the form of five Elemental Fae mentors. They're supposed to help me control my powers, but who's going to keep the elements from controlling me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This is a medium burn reverse harem paranormal romance, and book one of the Elemental Fae Academy trilogy.</description>

  <description>Come check out book 4 in The Capsule Killer series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author Note:&lt;/i&gt; This is book 4 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.</description>

  <description>Nothing angers a bully more than holding a mirror to who they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is out, the battle lines drawn. What started as a fight between city and country, escalated into a battle of good versus evil—those with a conscience against those whose greed grows stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn a blind eye to the sins or leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve made my choice, and now I intend to ruin the tyrants who stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, I need to get my brother back.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; She calls me a madman. I call her mine. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a sinner. &lt;br /&gt;He is a serial killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She demanded vengeance. &lt;br /&gt;He demanded her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She vowed to avenge. &lt;br /&gt;He vowed to destroy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She created a web of lies. &lt;br /&gt;He wore a mask of deceit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wanted to escape. &lt;br /&gt;He captured her instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no rules in this twisted game of theirs. &lt;br /&gt;But there is a winner who claims the sinner.</description>

  <description>His vengeance written in blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the heir to a forbidden fortune. &lt;br /&gt;He is the only son of a mafia family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the criminal underworld hot on their tail, Sal Raniero hid his true love, Iris Nakamura, far away from the violence. With her narrowly escaping their crosshairs, he manipulated the system to work in their favor, but with his father arranging his marriage to another woman, Sal and Iris are quickly running out of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invitations are sent. The cake is ordered. The gown is fit. &lt;br /&gt;The couple is mismatched, flawed from the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;And someone is bound to be hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the third book of a Tomb of Ashen Tears, choice becomes the invisible obstacle Sal and Iris must both overcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believing in their precious intimacy, Iris must decide how much blood she will shed for the man she loves. Inching closer to an unwanted future, Sal must choose between fighting the will of his family or flying with the desire of his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An admitted word fiend, KAILEE REESE SAMUELS loves pushing her readers’ boundaries with original, addictive storylines and unexpected twists to keep you turning the page. Her genre-busting, lyrical writing style is punctuated with elements of dark romance, romantic suspense, psychological thriller, mafia, MC, BDSM, and realism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the author of JULIET, 22, SHE/HE, UNSPOKEN, POPPY, and TAT BOOKS (Salt Kissed Love, Famous Last Words, and the upcoming Every Minute I Love You), she believes first and foremost her books should be entertaining and serve as the perfect escape with a delicious beverage, a box of chocolate, and plenty of tissues.</description>

  <description>I swear to God, Jacob Lynch, if I ever see your arrogant, smug face again, I’ll ruin your manhood with a swift knee.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You were the glorified football captain, the heartthrob, the most popular boy in school and yet suddenly you vanish leaving all your horrid friends pointing the finger at me, circling like hungry vultures to see if I would break. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just didn’t know that I already had. Daily. For months I cried for you. You. Broke. Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You taunted and tormented me for years until you finally convinced me to fall in love with you. You said, “Nothing can ever tear us apart.” And I believed you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you lied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then you left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a word, without a touch, without a sound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You. Just. Left. Right when my world fell to pieces, you lit the match and watched from afar, as what remained went up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I ever do see your stupidly handsome face again, you’ll be nothing more than the boy I used to know. The boy who broke my heart and crushed my soul all in a single day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Jacob Lynch… I have no more XO’s to give. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer yours,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I hate how much I still love you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today bestselling author Kimberly Knight, comes a sexy, hockey suspense standalone novel.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rhys Cole’s life has always revolved around hockey. Growing up, he knew he’d play in the National Hockey League, but when his dream of being drafted didn’t happen, he chose the next best thing: becoming a hockey sportscaster for a local sports station. But just like in sports, you win some, you lose some. When Rhys discovers his girlfriend cheating with a stranger in his bed, he walks to the local bar down the street to let off some steam. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After moving her way up the journalism field by covering stories in extreme weather conditions and working late hours, Ashtyn Valor is now the lead anchor for the nightly news. Finally settled into her career, Ashtyn is ready to take the next step in life with her boyfriend. But when he unexpectedly breaks up with her, Ashtyn decides to numb the pain with alcohol at the closest bar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rhys and Ashtyn both expected an evening of alcohol to mask the pain of that October night. What they didn’t expect was meeting someone who could shield them from the darkness of their heartaches. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or that their pasts would dangerously intertwine … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When obsession becomes dangerous, Ashtyn turns to Rhys for safety. But how safe are they really? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The game of love always goes on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And their game was just beginning. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

My best friend.&lt;br /&gt;I put her in his care for safekeeping.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, she had been a bad, bad girl doing very naughty things.&lt;br /&gt;And now, the men in the darkness want her dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one problem—&lt;br /&gt;She has other plans.&lt;br /&gt;And now, it is my job to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fetish world, nothing is as it seems in the middle of a sleepy little town in Texas. The Juliet academy lies on the outskirts, keeping the hustle and bustle alive and saving Sugargrove from extinction. The carnival of carnal feasts beckons as the house of mirrors threatens to collapse, shattering everything they once knew to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your invitation to escape awaits…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Salt Kissed Love is the first book in the series.&lt;br /&gt;However, you must have read the prerequisite world-building book – JULIET. &lt;br /&gt;NOT a standalone book. Please read Juliet prior to reading Salt Kissed Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kailee Reese Samuels writes dark dirty lit. Her words may cause increased heartrate, hand sweating, and other issues. You are strongly advised to enter at your own risk. Not for the faint of heart. May cause triggers in some. Others may choose to ride again and again. You have been warned.</description>

  <description>I hadn’t seen Ryan Hudson coming. He stumbled into my life and settled immediately into my soul. As I’ve watched him beginning to explore a new kind of freedom, my heart has swelled and shattered a million times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trust he has placed in my hands is monumental. I will not let him down as others have. He thought the protective wall he built was strong enough, but I’m pulling it down. He will bare his soul to me. If he thinks his demons will scare me away, he's wrong. I’m not intimidated by them. We will fight them together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life hasn’t been fair to Ryan. But he hasn't let it beat him, because only the brave find hope in a second chance. He doesn’t comprehend the strength that he possesses, but I’m going to show him. Even if I have to burn the world down so that he can rise from the ashes of his painful past to be the beautiful creature I know him to be, that's what I'll do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he will come to understand is that he no longer belongs to the past. I am his present and his future. Those that clipped his wings no longer own him. I do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And it's time for my Phoenix to soar free... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is our happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Author’s note: Phoenix is a dark novel with intense scenes that may trigger some readers. Please read with caution. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Now that Special Agent Nate Hawthorn is busy determining if their latest case was murder or suicide, and is left dealing with the backlash of Connor Levine’s release, Suede Harris finds information that could lead to a potential motive for their killer. But will she share it with Nate, or try to find answers on her own? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While sorting out the timeline, Suede learns secrets that could not only land her in hot water with the Sheriff, but change everything she trusts and believes. When betrayal cuts too close to home, Suede is forced to see just who has her back and who would leave her hanging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author Note:&lt;/i&gt; This is book 3 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Boys and girls can’t be just friends. A lie made up by overprotective fathers afraid of the illustrious teenage boy and his uncontrollable hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reid and I were the exception to the rule. Best friends. A friendship bound with the spit in our palms and the gospel of a crossed heart. I lasted four years before the cliche caught me. Another four before my truth surged forward with an attempt at a kiss and a drunken confession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years on, Reid Rivere is Hollywood’s golden boy. Ten years on, and I, Roxy Monroe have found myself embroiled in another cliche... at least I’m consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men and women can’t be just friends. I’m starting to learn that the hard way.</description>

  <description>What happens when the kids leave for college and you remember you’re not just mom, but a woman too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply going through the motions, on autopilot day after day, weighed heavily on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing which bonded my husband and me, before the kids came along, was slowly cast aside as their needs grew more demanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intimacy became an act; a performance, without the desire, passion, and lust we once shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My need to feel desired and wanted by my husband ate at me and I was determined to make him see the woman he married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t going to give up and hatched a plan, one which would hopefully forge a new beginning for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting to keep our love alive was a risk, but, for us, I was prepared to do anything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"You’re my assistant."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic words every girl at Trinity Academy is dying to hear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’m the one who gets stuck with Mason Chargill, the star of most women’s fantasies but my nightmare. One of the heirs to CRC Holdings, he might be dangerously gorgeous, but his cold and callous demeanor makes him an ice prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He expects me to abide by the Academy’s hierarchy, to be at his constant beck and call.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, right… hell will freeze over before that ever happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for him, I’m no pushover.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, he’s determined to break me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only there were a way to melt the shard of ice he calls a heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is Book 2 in The Trinity Academy Series. &lt;br /&gt;All 3 books are interconnected, and some plots have been carried over from the 1st book and will be carried over to the final book in this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#ColledgeRomance #Billionare #RichKids #NewAdult(less)</description>

It might take a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it’s not like we’re on a deadline or anything.</description>

  <description>Vengeance has a name, and her name is mine. &lt;br /&gt;My role is to take action against the darkest men I’ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;To kill them one at a time. &lt;br /&gt;Until my list is complete. &lt;br /&gt;And in doing so, I’m going to use my most powerful weapon—my body. &lt;br /&gt;They ruined my life, and now it’s my turn to destroy theirs. &lt;br /&gt;Even if it means a death sentence for me, each drop of blood will be deserving. &lt;br /&gt;Each kill will be worthy of the price I may need to pay. &lt;br /&gt;My name is Isadora, and my target is the Moretti Mafia.</description>

  <description>I am the queen of my world, owning the dark nights.&lt;br /&gt;He is the king of his world, ruling with a firm hand. &lt;br /&gt;Unknowingly, we both fight for our freedom.&lt;br /&gt;He needs the freedom to breathe, whereas I fight for my freedom to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three worlds collide:&lt;br /&gt;•	Mine&lt;br /&gt;•	His&lt;br /&gt;•	Ours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smashed together, obliterating the last little bit of morality I had. &lt;br /&gt;He will never forgive me because I will never give him the chance. &lt;br /&gt;Secrets have been buried. Lies have been told. Betrayal is at the highest degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real name is Jessica Winthrop, A.K.A. The Queen of Hearts. I am an underground poker player. I don’t play in the comfortable basements of family homes with the "good ‘ol boys" from around the neighborhood. No, I play in the depth of dark basements against men that will slit my throat at the turn of a card or the drop of a chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the tender age of four, my decisions were made by my mentor, my father, that is, until he became my adversary. His decision making came to a screeching halt when I turned seventeen. Three years later, I had to make some of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make, but I made them, and I’ve stuck by them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, those same decisions are now coming back to haunt me.</description>

  <description>Seth Reynold learned at a young age that there was nothing more important in this world than family and loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;When his father walked out, leaving him and his little sister with their alcoholic mother, Seth was only eight years old. He had to grow up almost overnight, becoming the only one responsible for his younger sister, Jolie who was then only three.&lt;br /&gt;Seth struggled to take care of his little sister, but refused to betray his mother, afraid he and Jolie would be separated if he did.&lt;br /&gt;But help came in the form of his best friend Jared Walker, and his family. Jared’s mom Sylvie took both Seth and Jolie under her wing. Knowing Seth would never betray his mother, Sylvie made a deal with the young boy that he would always come to her whenever his mother vanished on a drinking binge, which was something that happened often. That way him and Jolie could stay together.&lt;br /&gt;Seth grew up knowing he owed Jared and his family everything, and that included his complete loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;But when Seth returned from a photoshoot, which had taken him to Australia for six months, and met Jared’s new girlfriend, Savannah, the loyalty he had for Jared was put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with Savannah was not part of the plan, but she was what his heart wanted, and Seth struggled between doing the right thing or following his heart.&lt;br /&gt;The fact she loved him too only made him want her more. He knew in his heart that she was The One.&lt;br /&gt;Will loyalty come before love, or can Seth find a way for him and Savannah to get their happy ever after.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; I’m the kid your parents warned you about… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eighteen months in prison or three years at Oceanside Academy. &lt;br /&gt;Reform school has met its match in me, even if it is full of young offenders. Thieves, graffiti writers, drug runners and other petty criminals reside within the walls, and I'm just like them. &lt;br /&gt;But what they didn't tell me was that I'd be one of only a handful of girls in a hoard full of boys. It'll take more than just street smarts to keep my wits about me. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone here has a chip on their shoulders, and I'm no different. Mine's one of the biggest, that's why they call me Asia because I have one as large as a continent. &lt;br /&gt;Rules or not, these bad boys are about to discover I've earned my label for reason... &lt;br /&gt;I'm the biggest misfit of them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Delinquent is book one of this new gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy trilogy for 17+ readers and deals with adult themes and some subjects you may find upsetting. Contains foul language and sexual scenes** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Noemi Cruz is a woman who is blessed with beauty, intelligence, and money. After losing her parents and her grandparents, she and her brother have inherited a nice sum of money and an old Brownstone in one of the swankiest neighborhoods in Brooklyn, NY. Life isn’t perfect, but as long as they have each other, she can live with it. That is until her brother and his family move to Silent Creek, NY a county in the upstate country region of the state.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noemi who is a self-described City girl and could never imagine living anywhere else finds herself in Silent Creek when she has to visit her brother and drop off her precocious twelve-year-old niece. When her car breaks down on the way to the house, the Town's sexiest man Alex Knight comes to her rescue. Alex is a former professional baseball player who owns the town horse ranch with his father but isn’t the best businessman. His biggest flaw is taking in horses when their owners cannot pay for their upkeep. This puts the ranch in jeopardy, but Alex doesn’t care, all he wants to do is help horses in need. Ranching, fishing, and riding his motorcycle are what makes him happy. When he meets Noemi, he knows he wants to make sure she doesn't leave, seeing the type of sass she has he challenges her. Will Noemi stay or will she head back to Brooklyn where she already has a life waiting for her?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Storms of Summer isn’t just a story about lust and love. It’s also a story about family and how much you are willing to give up and take on when you are needed during a tragic event. It is a story about a brother and sister who lean on each other when times are hard and who come to realize that even though they have been dealt more than their share of tragedies, they still have each other. Storms of Summer is a story that will resonate with many for years to come.</description>

  <description>Following the brutal murders of Jade Kelly and Gina Elliot, newly promoted DI Dylan Monroe is assigned to work the case, alongside DS Layla Monahan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the body count rapidly rises—each slaying more savage than the last—it soon becomes clear the butchered and mutilated victims have one thing in common—they are all male to female transsexuals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With time against them, Dylan is forced to go undercover in the only place that provides a link to the victims—Dorothy’s, a well-known drag and cabaret bar in the heart of Liverpool.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Avaline Saddlebags is a gripping, often amusing, psychological thriller with an astonishing twist that will take your breath away... change can be DEADLY!&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

      <![CDATA[Everything about Avaline Saddlebag was unique, the beautiful cover, the well written storyline and the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this murder mystery, it delivered a little bit of everything from suspense, drama, humour and then added some emotional tugging at the heart strings. It...]]>

  <description>With the investigation into Kara Lockland’s death causing a stir, Suede Harris has a hunch that everything happening in Summer Grove is connected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After requesting to shadow Special Agent Nate Hawthorn on the case, she hopes they figure out whose killing young women and why Kara ended up in the lake before her friend Graham loses his freedom for a crime she’s not sure he committed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more bodies being found, each uncovering more clues, will they nab the suspect before he kills again? Or will they only lead to more questions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Author Note:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; This is book 2 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.</description>

  <description>Oliver Ice, one of Boston University’s notorious hockey players, has been on my radar since I slammed into his rock-hard body during my first week of college, three years ago. He helped me to my feet, muttered an apology, and ran off after his girlfriend, dashing my hopes of a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s the bartender where I work, and this time, very much single. Night after night I watch the tall, broad, and sexy right winger mixing drinks and being Mr. Personality, while I remind myself how horribly my last relationship ended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Oliver overhears a private conversation, he offers to be the one thing I need more than anything--my pretend boyfriend at a dreaded family reunion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One weekend was all it was meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do I protect my fragile heart when the lines between fantasy and reality blur with our first kiss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;ICED can be read as a standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Another beginning brings forth another ending....or does it? Can there truly be just one beginning or one definitive ending when the tapestries of our lives are woven together so seamlessly? &lt;br /&gt;With their home destroyed a mere forty-eight hours after taking Kia into their care, the group finds itself taking refuge on Rolland’s farm in the remote countryside of Dartmoor, hoping for the chance to solve some of the mysteries that surround them. &lt;br /&gt;But you can’t run from everything and you can’t hide for long…. &lt;br /&gt;Secrets begin to unfold, eroding away at the trust they’ve built like the ocean wears away the rocks… but how many of these secrets are kept to preserve their safety? And whose safety is really at risk? &lt;br /&gt;In Pursuit of Trust, answers are offered - but at what cost? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lacey Williams: Good Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Riverbourne Preparatory, that title made me desirable. All a rich boy wants is a pretty and obedient woman on his arm. And I was most definitely both of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at Arcadia High? Being a good girl made me a target. I became a trophy for the spoilt, an end-of-year reward for those willing to play the game: bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each side wants me so the other can’t have me. Schoolyard bullies who fight over the same damn toy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city kids have arrived to reclaim what’s theirs, and the country? Well. &lt;br /&gt;Those boys sure don’t give in without a fight.</description>

  <description>One night of complete surrender is all it takes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gareth Harris is Manchester United’s reclusive star defender. He has control over all aspects of his life. But a lifetime of supporting his siblings and filling in for an emotionally absent father has taken its toll. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sloan Montgomery is a clothing stylist whose world was turned upside down when she found herself pregnant and moving to Manchester with a man who was never supposed to be her forever. Now recently divorced and struggling with shared custody of her daughter, control is a fleeting concept for this American living in England. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both Gareth and Sloan are in need of a release. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A moment in time where they can forget about their pasts and family pressures...and just... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...surrender. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one could predict what happens when both of their defences are down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Surrender is part one of the Final Harris Brother Duet and concludes with Dominate. This duet reads great on it's own, but to maximize enjoyment, check out the first three brothers’ books in Challenge, Endurance, and Keeper</description>

The Harris family children are a tight knit group, although they love throwing banter around. <br />Imagine feeling trapped...]]>

  <description>Eva&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world dulled when you decided the fate of my future. Our son speaks of you as a &lt;br /&gt;superhero, and I grapple with the idea I wasn’t good enough to keep you here, safe—with us. I spend my days working to support our son, and my nights turn into one endless string of reckless decisions because reality provides no comfort. The truth of the situation buried deep down, since you’re gone, and I stand drowning in my own grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the shore there’s a lady whose torment captured me the first time her aura caught my eye. Her beauty holds steady behind the mask she wears every morning. Something about her piques my interest as the days go by, and I know deep inside my mission beckons to uncover her secret and bring her back among the living. Written in her body language, speaks a familiar road I traveled. A road of sorrow nobody deserves stranded alone in its strangled web.</description>

It’s a personal reflection of a woman’s grief stricken journey, due to her husband and the father of her young son committing suicide.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“To keep her safe, I’ll make her deadly.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FROST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punching out a creep in a bar, Daisy Simmons picks a fight with the wrong people: a ruthless human trafficker and his vicious son. They’ve called me, their expert assassin, to “handle” her. Eliminating rival criminals has made me wealthy and quelled my thirst for vengeance, but I have rules: I don’t kill the innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep Daisy alive, I have only one choice: take her captive and hide her in my dungeon. To save her, I must learn her secrets. She’s buried her past, and I have to know why. Who is she? Why does she look familiar? How did she become so irresistibly feisty? Why isn’t she more afraid of me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refusing to despair, she fights me constantly, torn between needing and hating me. Captivity awakens her dark, deviant hungers – her need to be dominated and used. Beautiful and twisted, she sates my desires like no one else ever could. There’s far more to her than what’s on the surface, and I’m going to uncover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bosses want Daisy dead, but I can’t keep her locked away forever. Protecting her means taking drastic measures: betrayal, deception... even training Daisy to kill...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The Agency taught me to survive – and I will.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAISY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life was a mess long before I stood up to the infamous Burke crime family, but I don’t regret it, not even when their hired gun comes for me. When Frost breaks into my home, I expect to die – not to be imprisoned without any hope of escape, at his mercy and stripped of my dignity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He punishes my resistance with cruelty and humiliation, but I can’t give in. I won’t accept my fate. I’m not defenseless – and I have friends. The women of the Agency prepared me for the worst. They’re out there, and they’ll find me – if they discover I’m missing in time. I can’t count on it – I must fight for my life, no matter how I feel about Frost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s caring and kind for a sadistic killer, with heart-stopping looks and a godlike physique. I can’t ignore my body’s primal response to being owned by him. He infuriates me and excites me, stoking my endless carnal passion. And when he teaches me to fight, he reminds me who I really am: a conqueror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll find a way out of here. I’m not afraid of anyone, and Frost’s making me more dangerous every day. We will face a cunning enemy, but together we are unstoppable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publisher’s note: “Deadly” is a dark, romantic thriller with erotic content, no cliffhangers, no cheating and a HEA. It contains material some may find disturbing. Reader discretion is advised. All books in “The Agency” series can be read as standalone stories without reading any others, but reading them all in order is encouraged!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does happily ever after look like after so much darkness?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two years after the trauma of her kidnapping, and the auction that brought them together, Thalia and James are finally getting their happily ever after! Celebrating their love is a piece of wedding cake, but with the help of their wild and crazy friends from Purgatory, it’s destined to be a wedding day no one will forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thrilling mix of kinky fun, laughter, surprises, and the same sexy heat you’ve come to expect from James and Thalia — &lt;em&gt;Tying the Knot &lt;/em&gt;is the perfect conclusion to this series that has brought readers to the darkest of lows, and the highest of highs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s time for the light. It’s time to celebrate. It’s time to get married!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This is a romance that includes elements of BDSM, power-exchange, and references to darker content. It is the final book in Thalia and James' story, but there may be more to come on other characters, speak up if you want more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Love conquers all, or so they say, but is love enough to overcome James and Thalia’s history together? Is it enough to carry them through the heavy decision about whether they should stay with each other? And is it enough to take on the ‘normal’ relationship steps of meeting friends and family in James’ privileged world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Thalia and James work to build a life together, a real life, there are other challenges brewing on the horizon, and Thalia’s past isn’t done with her yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this rollercoaster conclusion to the Thalia series she is taken to the loveliest of highs and the darkest of lows as she fights to decide who she is, and who she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WARNING: This book contains BDSM, strong language, and scenes of violence and dubious consent. Intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Thalia may be free, but can she learn to live after the darkness?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thalia and James have just met under the most insane of circumstances. He purchased her at an underground auction from a man who kidnapped her, tormented her, and sold her to the highest bidder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their first few months together Thalia wants to view James as her savior, her knight in shining armor that she can stay with in safety, but she can't escape the trauma she went through and the lingering effects it has caused. James isn't sure, now that he has Thalia, if he can handle the depth of submission she displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can James help her strike a balance between who she is as a person and her newfound craving for submission, or will her urge to submit swallow her whole until James has no choice but to set her free?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;**Publisher's Note: This book contains BDSM, strong language, and discussions of dubious consent which may be triggering for some readers. Intended for mature audiences.**&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>“I’ll break you down. It may take time, but I will.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And if I don’t break?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You will.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken from work one night, Thalia is thrust into the violent, controlling world of a man she thought had been the security guard for her building, but she quickly learns that this was only a cover to get to her, to take her. As her old life is erased, the guard pushes Thalia to recognize the darker sides of herself, while Thalia endeavors to hold on to who she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped alone with her abductor, can Thalia fight to retain her self, or will his small glimpses of kindness cause her to finally submit to him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Security Binds Her’ is a brutal journey that leaves readers breathless and waiting to turn the page to find out if Thalia will break, or be lost forever to the darkness around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WARNING: This book contains graphic punishments, disturbing situations, scenes of dubious consent, and very strong language.

  <description>She calls it a devil’s bargain. I call it a deal she can’t refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was owed a debt and I expected payment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That payment? &lt;br /&gt;One night in my bed. My rules. The debt cleared, and she could walk away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse things. And besides, debtors can’t be choosers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night started as it should. She obeyed as she should. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then something happened. Something I was wholly unprepared for. And what I saw changed everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke my own rules after that. And I didn’t keep my end of the bargain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because walking away was no longer an option I would grant her, no matter the cost.</description>

  <description>We had one night together. One unforgettable night. But that was over two years ago and we haven't spoken or seen each other since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole Taylor is a part of my past. A part that I desperately want to move on from. To forget how he made me feel. To forget the way he touched me. To forget his voice. It's easy to do that when he's not around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only he hasn't stayed gone like I hoped he would. He's back and I can't seem to keep my heart from pounding when I see him. I can't seem to convince myself that he means nothing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That he's not part of my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Part Of My Future is Raegan's story from Demons From My Past. It is a standalone novel and it is not necessary to read Demons From My Past prior to reading this. It contains adult content, adult language and sexual situations. It is intended for mature readers only.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Let the web unravel itself and try not to die in the process. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After losing her mother in a freak accident, Suede Harris is trying to pick up the pieces and move on with her life. With a history of trouble, including bad relationships, alcohol, and ditching college, finishing up her criminology degree seemed like the best way to start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While catching up back home with summer courses, she joins a study group to keep on track, but when her friends convince her to go geocaching, a simple trip will shake up her entire world. When the only treasure they find is a human bone, it will send her on a mission fueled by personal trauma to figure out what happened to the victim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she find the killer, or uncover secrets that have been long buried? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author Note:&lt;/i&gt; This is book 1 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.</description>

  <description>I tried to put him behind bars. Then he put me in a cage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I set out to show Eddie Vasco he’s not above the law, there was something I didn’t realize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is above the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s why I’m in a cage, wearing nothing but a tail, with the sting of his belt reminding me how disobedient pets are punished. That’s why he’s going to use me as roughly as he pleases.</description>

      <![CDATA[Whilst Caged was an enjoyable enough read, it just lacked something for me. If you like a hot and steamy read this book certainly fits. The storyline had a lot of promise, but there wasn’t enough depth of character. I was expecting more ruthless behaviour from the Don of the mafia and his soldier...]]>

  <description>One man’s wife is another’s obsession.&lt;br /&gt;We had a love I thought could never be broken. But I was wrong. We weren’t as strong as our vows once promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark secrets and vicious lies, they tore us apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut too deep, leaving open wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain is something that should never come from the man you love. Forgiveness, understanding, tenderness, yes. But never pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact remains. He is my husband and I am his wife. Perhaps he should have remembered that a year ago when he committed his first sin against our marriage. And perhaps then, I wouldn’t have fallen for the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A devil who had me in his sights from the very beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A devil who swore to never let me go.</description>

  <description>Caught between two worlds, I no longer know who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of the Chosen. Four girls, and four boys, destined to have it all: wealth, status, and a future. Now, I find myself on the other side looking for a way back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father’s criminal case meant we lost it all. Forced out of our home, our city, our life, we started anew in a sweet country town called Arcadia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except after one day as “the new girl” I know there isn’t a single sweet thing about Arcadia High. Boys versus girls. Those who have it all versus those who’d do anything to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble brews amongst the student body. Love, lies, and betrayal. And when the consequences spill out the decorative gates? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spoilt country kids won’t know what hit them after the city come to collect.</description>

  <description>Pride is the devil’s bullet, but envy pulls the trigger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody gets Tribal. Not like she did. No one understands what he went through or what made him temporarily flee the MC lifestyle. It was that kid. It all started with the kid. He couldn’t save him, and now he’s wrought with inner turmoil. His old rage is set to simmer and only one woman knows his deepest, darkest secrets, but she wants nothing to do with him anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Horizon is in an all-female MC of her own now. She’s the Iron Butterfly, a knife-wielding enforcer hellbent on shutting down a Russian human trafficking ring. When she’s sent to her grandmother’s casino to investigate its role in this Black Market Railroad, she finds herself face to face with a past lover, ripping open old scars and tearing fresh wounds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mel has messed everything up. She’s lied, she’s cheated, and she’s single-handedly destroyed her ability to hang with the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC. They want nothing to do with her now. Her two options are to leave town and start over someplace new or stick around and begin that fresh life in the RZBT MC’s backyard, in a place nobody would ever imagine she’d go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bikers, strippers, human traffickers, the Bratva, and a serial killer collide in Pride’s Envy, book 3 in the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please be advised that the books in the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC series should be read in order.</description>

  <description>It’s been five days since I’ve seen Regan. Five days of unanswered calls, five days of unread messages, and five days of letting my anger fester to the point it isn’t healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the cause of the fury slicking my veins, the reason I can’t numb my feelings. I need her, but instead of standing beside me as I face my darkest day, she stays at his side, protecting him, sheltering him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand she’s mad, she caught me in a lie, but I can’t fix the mistakes I’ve made if she refuses to talk to me. I guess I should be grateful? Maybe she’s staying away because she’s trying to save me more heartache, because she doesn’t want to come clean. I’m not the only one at fault here. I did wrong, but so did she. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one difference: I chose the right side of the law. She didn’t.</description>

  <description>He’s arrogant.&lt;br /&gt;I’m sassy.&lt;br /&gt;He’s an ass. &lt;br /&gt;I’m classy. &lt;br /&gt;He works for the prosecution.&lt;br /&gt;I work for the defense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are enemies, yet I crave him more than anything. A night twisted beneath the sheets doesn’t equal a lifetime commitment, but it does begin my downward spiral. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve dusted myself off more than once, but he’s a smudge that refuses to budge. That pompous, arrogant, beautiful man doesn’t deserve me, so why do I keep giving myself to him?</description>

  <description>Eyes Wide Shut meets Cruel Intentions in this ruthlessly unforgiving and sexy dark, high school romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls us his broken saints. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s what I am…or was. Broken. Until Gage Astor stole my heart and introduced me to a whole new seductive world—one with secrets and intrigue and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much money. Money buys everything, even your reputation at Brighton Saints Academy, an exclusive high school for the elite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Remi St. James, and I’m new money. I don’t belong here, but the Broken Saints accepted me, molded me, shaped me into a stunning creature that slays life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Sawyer, Palmer, Rush, and Emry. The secret society amid Brighton Saints. The most beautiful and powerful. The only thing more valuable to them than money is secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh, Brighton Saints is full of secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have secrets…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I’m initiated into the Broken Saints, that’s when the fun (and fear) really begins. I see things and hear things and do things no high school girl should ever be subjected to. And they make me believe it’s all my idea…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a toy to them. It’s all a twisted game, and I don’t even know if I want it to stop… I’m in too deep now. There might not be any hope. Gage Astor is a god here; he won’t ever let me leave his society. When he says you’re his, you belong to him. Body, mind, and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like all of his Broken Saints. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to play their game. For now. I have to find a way out...before I lose myself to them completely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is the first book in the Broken Saints Society series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you been invited into the secret society?

  <description>I’m Remi St. James, and I’m a member of a secret society—one that rules the gothic halls of Brighton Saints Academy. I’ve officially crossed over. I’m an elite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel reborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the way he looks at me now…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gage Astor wants me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve become the power couple that everyone envies. Even his Broken Saints. There’s a whisper in the ranks, a threat. I feel it when they look at me; the mysterious new girl that worked her way into the elite circle, presenting danger should she discover too much about their secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I go deeper into their world, I start to question who my friends are. Who my enemies are. And whether I can even tell the difference anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl had to die in order for me to be adopted into their society…and like her, I fear the only way out of their ring of trust may be death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the homecoming dance right around the corner, the girls of Brighton have a show to put on. Exquisite dresses and a glamor of makeup; a mask of wealth to hide who we really are. Who I’m becoming…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy is the head that wears the crown—and Gage rules with an unrivaled cruelty. When the biggest secret of all is revealed, I’ll have to don my own viscous tiara to take back control of my life.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well hello there! This is getting interesting, I couldn’t put this book down and I’ve pre-ordered Nefarious Boys. I’m loving the strong minded characters and the way these girls are guiding the game. It’s like a strategic game played with people, where bloodlines, money and the elite rule. Don’t...]]>

  <description>Rod Beton and Travis Walker have known each other a long time; since the second grade when Rod was the new kid in town and Travis befriended him with Pokémon trading cards and a fruit snack. Apparently Rod’s easy. Since that day they've had each other's back's, bread and butter, biscuit and gravy...and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Rod fell in love with Travis. He's been hoping for some kind of signal from Travis that he returns Rod's feelings. When Travis announces his surprise engagement over Thanksgiving dinner Rod decides he's done waiting for the impossible. He packs his belongings and heads for Skagit and a new life. Even if Travis suddenly decided Rod was the man for him would Rod be able to put aside his insecurities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis always knew he was destined to take over the family business. As the only boy he’s expected to take the helm of the Walker farming operation, and he’s good at it. An engagement to a local girl he’s pals with seems like the perfect solution gets him mom off his back and ensures the family line -- eventually. When his best friend abruptly leaves town Travis’s eyes are finally opened to the difference between what is expected of him and what he could expect for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His Best Man&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone in the Accidental Roots series, a friends to lovers mm romance with an HEA. Bisexual/gay.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars<br />A new to me author and whilst I enjoyed the book, it felt a bit flat. The storyline was engaging and the characters were varied and endearing. This could of been a really good book, but I felt the characters and story lacked depth. I was left wanting more info about the characters....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Brutal, vicious, shocking… A cataclysmic novel of life in its most raw form…”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; – 5 stars – Picky B*tches Book Blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth Wright and Jane Ellerton are messed up. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; messed up. Their violence and love of excess makes them a perfect match and together they make a formidable couple. Life should be good in their screwed-up world, but there are &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; too many people who have an agenda and want to destroy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dark, obsessional and downright dangerous pair will do anything to ensure no one gets in their way and they do bad things. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Very&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; bad things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drugs, guns and murder - along with Seth's escalating paranoia and Jane's erratic behaviour throws them further into chaos, madness and debauchery and their promise to love one another until the end of time turns into a war. A war not just against everyone around them, but with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they get their lives on track or will one of them finally snap, meaning they will both forever have to live with the aftermath?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, obsession is a deadly downfall and love does not necessarily conquer all. Especially when it is well and truly warped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;** This book contains written depictions of graphic violence, sex and strong language. It also contains some themes that may be uncomfortable for certain readers.**&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"...I couldn’t help but think of Seth and Jane like the couple in the movie Natural Born Killers. Which, at the time was a pretty controversial movie, much like what I think this story is as well ...I love how the author did not hold anything back. The story is in your face, every messed up thing you can think of is probably written in the pages... "&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; -5 stars - Sinfully Wicked Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“…If you love dark romance and aren’t afraid to dive into a world of sex, drugs, and violence, you’ll love this one!”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; – 5 stars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“…This is a rollercoaster of a book with lots of sex and violence and plenty of twisted people…”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; - 5 stars – TM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“...Until the End of Time is a gripping tale of love skewed through the lens of drugs, alcohol, and duress…”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; – 5 stars – RMGilmour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"...Gritty. Dark. Fast Paced… this story takes the seedier part of life head on- sex, drugs, violence are the back drop to this obsessive high octane love story…”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; – 5 stars &lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Introduction to this author and honestly I’m on the fence, trying to decide what I thought about this book. It’s okay, but sorry to say I won’t be reaching for any further instalments! I love a dark romance but I didn’t feel that this was dark. It was about a bunch of misfits who liked to get off...]]>

  <description>I’m Special Agent Jackson Turner. Over eighteen years ago, my brothers Andrew and Sylvester were killed by Madison Stone and Joseph Shelton AKA Stone. Today, I’m breaking the law. I’m stalking my niece Alyssa and I’m planning a slow, painful death for her mother Madison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, during this planning, I came across some very disturbing information. Information that could change the course of my criminal behavior and convince me to save a family I was once set out to destroy. The truth leads me down a dark path of secrets, lies, deception and murder. Will I sacrifice avenging the death of my brothers to save Madison and her family? &lt;br /&gt;Or will I destroy her?</description>

  <description>Continue the thrilling story of Stone and Madison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“What am I going to do without you?” she whispered in my ear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Don’t worry about me. Take care of Bryan.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I can’t do it without you. I can’t do anything without you.” She sniveled in my ear, grabbing on to my neck. I could feel her tears on my shoulder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Look at me. You have to. Bryan needs you. I need you to tell me you’re going to be alright.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“No…no, I’m not.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Maddie, please…tell me. I won’t be able to sleep tonight or ever. Tell me.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I remembered this day like it was yesterday. &lt;br /&gt;The day Stone killed Lucky for me. &lt;br /&gt;I was thirteen years old. &lt;br /&gt;I loved Stone since I was eleven. &lt;br /&gt;He was my everything. The only good thing in my life, aside from the kids. &lt;br /&gt;I know I shouldn't love him. &lt;br /&gt;I know it is forbidden. &lt;br /&gt;But, I do and I don't care what anyone thinks. &lt;br /&gt;This other man controls me. He has taken me away from my kids...Away from Stone. &lt;br /&gt;He hurts me every day. Physically and emotionally. &lt;br /&gt;He tears me down and makes me do things I don't want to do. &lt;br /&gt;I won't let him get to me, at least, I'll try. &lt;br /&gt;I have to be strong...for them. &lt;br /&gt;I'll wait for Stone to save me...again. &lt;br /&gt;But, will he? Or will he realize that the love we share can never be?</description>

      <![CDATA[I’m glad I took a chance to read the next instalment in this series. It’s definitely an improvement on the first book. It still didn’t flow as easily as it should of and seemed unrealistic. I wanted to gran both Stone and Maddie and butt their heads together at times. This book has so many twists...]]>

  <description>He’s the only son.&lt;br /&gt;The chosen one. The golden boy. And the Kid.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m Sal Raniero’s soulmate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the man I love more than words, more than the air filling my lungs, more than the blood rushing in my veins. My moon rises and falls with every kiss from his lips and bittersweet memory we create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did it, narrowly escaping his father’s reign of terror, but the problem is we are now separated and far apart for the sake of safety. I have sought refuge undercover, and Sal has gone into a cage, which will paralyze his actions and turn his insidious thoughts into reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His worst nightmares will come alive and send him into madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While he is in captivity, hidden for his protection, I understand this will change us. I know we will never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breaking up may save our lives, but will it shatter our love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many read my books out of order.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended reading order is available on my website under Sal’s Reading List.&lt;br /&gt;Famous Last Words is a lengthy book similar to Juliet and Salt Kissed Love.</description>

  <description>Stone and Madison met each other when his heroin addicted father dropped him off at Madison's trailer park at the age of 14. Both were victims of drug addicted parents and a life of poverty. With no one to guide them, take care of them, or love them, Madison and Stone take on the role of adults and take care of each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a story of two young people fighting to survive in an environment that's set up to destroy them. With no guidance and no love, they turn to each other. A strong bond forms between them and as they get older, their bond blossoms into a love they cannot deny. But, the odds are against them. There are secrets threatening to destroy their unconditional love. Murder and Revenge unravel the twists and turns that will change the course of their lives forever. Stone has killed for her once before. Will he kill for her again &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[First time reader of Angel Rose’s. This book had quite a good storyline, but I thought it was poorly executed. It felt a bit jumpy and timelines didn’t match up. The characters were a bit wishy washy and didn’t flow naturally. However, with a good beta team and some editing, it could of made this...]]>

  <description>I have three superstitions I live by:&lt;br /&gt;1. No dating all season.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don’t jinx a no-hitter while one’s in progress. &lt;br /&gt;3. Be cold-hearted. If you find something you think about more than baseball, destroy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calliope Thomas is one of those things. Ever since she left a bad review on the Max Energy Drink I endorse, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her. Obviously, when she said she hoped I had a losing season, I had to meet her and get her to take the words back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s making me do insane things. Like, obsess over the color of her panties or if I can make her blush. Read superstition one—I don’t do this sort of thing. &lt;br /&gt;I play ball, not chase after a woman I barely know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I am, and she wants nothing to do with me. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I’m the devil. &lt;br /&gt;And I have to say she makes me want to sin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m becoming a borderline stalker. &lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse she’s affecting my game. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t pitch. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t hit. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t focus. &lt;br /&gt;Something needs to give, and it won’t be me.</description>

      <![CDATA[I want to leave a bad review, just to see the outcome. Just kidding! This was a very hot, funny at times, easy to read sports romance. I enjoyed the book but there was something missing that didn’t reach the same heights as some of this authors others books. <br />Maybe it was all the indecisiveness an...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time ever books 1, 2, and 3 from WL Knightly's Zodiac series in a Box Set.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Zodiac Killer #1&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Darek Blake thought the secrets of his past were long buried, but when a young girl is murdered in a familiar way, finding the killer will not only bring back memories he’s repressed, but give him a golden opportunity to impress the FBI. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, when his partner, Special Agent Lizzy McNamara digs up evidence that’s a little too close to home, he’s shaken to the core. The worst sin he’s ever committed bubbles up, threatening to destroy his future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are the Zodiac killings a coincidence or is someone toying with him, and if so… who?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capricorn Book #2&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a suspect in a murder case never happens at a good time, but for Capricorn, Tad Halston, a recovering addict and former male escort who is on the verge of reclaiming his place as an in-demand male model, the timing couldn’t be worse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With bodies piling up and more evidence pointing to him for the murders, the last thing he needs is a series of anonymous messages demanding he make the next kill for vengeance. Can he murder the uncle who abused him and sent his life hurtling down this dark path, or will his sister become the real killer’s next victim? For Tad, time is running out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that Darek Blake has hired Bay “The Slayer” Collins as his divorce attorney, he realizes the man’s help will come at a much higher price. Becoming an informant was never part of the deal, but with new evidence hitting too close to home, Darek is left with no other choice. With the killer targeting Darek’s old friends, he has to decide which side is most important, his role as a detective, or his past as part of the Zodiac Society.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pisces Book #3&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the suspicious death of Tad Halston, Detective Darek Blake finds walking the line between NYPD detective and Zodiac member a more daunting task than ever. Hannah Halston, Tad’s sister, refuses to believe the official story that her brother went on a vengeful killing spree. She’s doing her best to clear his name, which brings Darek’s partner, Special Agent Lizzy McNamara, even closer to his criminal past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, whoever is targeting the Zodiacs has their sights on Logan Miller. His life is complicated enough already, with his struggling career and bitter relationship with an older woman, but when he meets Hannah Halston at her brother’s funeral, lending a sympathetic shoulder turns into so much more. He’s determined to end things with the older woman until she tells him she’s dying. Stuck between a rock and hard place, does he continue his relationship, or go where his heart tells him? Will the killer choose for him?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Hidden Creek High (#hch) is a young adult / new adult series filled with everything you've been asking for in a series that's wild, hot, fun, and crazy... it's recommended for mature readers because of cursing and 'certain scenes' ;) &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;In other words, if that sh*t bothers, stay away. But seriously... you're already here, don't stay away. START READING NOW. &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Detected Jake Thomas is on a mission to find Jo’s brother before he can do any more damage. But with the Hangman on the same exact mission, he will stop at nothing to reach the ultimate goal of taking Kyle Young down before Jake can interfere. &lt;br /&gt;With the FBI taking charge of the case, and the loss of his partner, Jake will find the corruption goes much deeper than expected. While he’s trying to play by the book, the Hangman decides to use human bait to lure Kyle where he wants him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Jake use the Hangman to find Kyle, getting both of the men he’s worked so hard to catch, or will the Hangman finish his final game?</description>

I'd told her I was going to take everything from her.&lt;br /&gt;I did. Things she could only give once.&lt;br /&gt;All of it was mine.&lt;br /&gt;She belonged to me the instant I saw her.&lt;br /&gt;She was a good girl.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I was going to ruin her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't a fairy tale. It's a story about a boy who made himself king, and his obsession.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;International Bestseller&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Michelle Horst, comes a new, sexy standalone novel in the &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Enemies To Lovers&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RHETT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evie Cole&lt;/i&gt;. She's the one person I can't figure out.&lt;br /&gt;People say they love you, but what they really mean is that they love how you make them feel about themselves, or what they can take from you.&lt;br /&gt;I can't leave her on the streets, so I make her a deal she can't refuse. It buys me the time I need to figure out whether Evie is the real deal or just another gold-digger.&lt;br /&gt;The day Evie graduates, she breaks all contact with me, which proves that she was only in it for the money.&lt;br /&gt;At least, that's what I think, until random payments are made to my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EVIE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rhett Daniels&lt;/i&gt;. My hero, who saved me from a life on the street. My unrequited love, who will sleep with every girl but me.&lt;br /&gt;His playful smile and humorous façade might fool others, but not me. I see myself in his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;He only has one rule.&lt;br /&gt;He'll pay for my education, giving me a chance to become independent. All I have to do is keep my clothes on which also means no dating.&lt;br /&gt;I hate being his charity case, but I tell myself it will only be until I graduate. I will find a way to pay him back.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I fell in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to forget the one man I can never have, I move to the other side of the country. I'm determined to make it on my own, but things don't always work out the way we want them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is book #5 in the Enemies To Lovers Series. Each book in the series is about a different couple. To get the full experience of their friendship, I'd recommend that you start with Heartless.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br /&gt;Heartless - Carter &amp;amp; Della&lt;br /&gt;Reckless - Logan &amp;amp; Mia&lt;br /&gt;Careless - Jaxson &amp;amp; Leigh&lt;br /&gt;Ruthless - Marcus &amp;amp; Willow&lt;br /&gt;Shameless - Rhett &amp;amp; Evie</description>

But I've settled for intensely disliking him. Asking me to forgive Jaxson is like asking me to willingly sit through a root canal.&lt;br /&gt;He's heartbreakingly gorgeous, emphasis on heartbreakingly.&lt;br /&gt;He's an amazing friend, just not to me.&lt;br /&gt;He's supportive, understanding, caring and loving, just not to me.&lt;br /&gt;No, for me he reserves his dark scowls and low growls.&lt;br /&gt;I'll do everything I can to save Marcus, but I'm not doing it for Jaxson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaxson West &amp;amp; Leigh Baxter ~ Book 3 in the Enemies To Lovers Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Stand Alone book in the Enemies To Lovers Series. Each book in the series is about a different couple. To get the full experience of their friendship I'd recommend that you start with Heartless.</description>

Heartless was a great intro to the series, Reckless delved deep down and brought all the dirt up. There are many illusions, things aren’t always as they seem, people can be deceptive and...]]>

Besides, he’d never notice someone like me. I have a three step plan. Get through college. Get a job. Get my sister out of the hell hole I left her in. That’s all I have time for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s until I hear of the betting pool the guys started. Whoever screws me first gets the money. The moment Carter looks at me, I know it’s only because of the bet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tell myself our first kiss is only for show. &lt;br /&gt;I hate my heart for falling for his irresistible charm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For one foolish moment, I actually want him to be my first earth-shattering love. All it takes for me to give in is a little attention, a cocky smile, and a fake promise of a happily-ever-after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I’m surrounded by crumpled sheets and the smell of sex, I realize I let him have me for four hundred dollars. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To save what little pride I have left, I pretend it didn’t mean anything, that he’s just one last screw before we all leave college. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent the last four years lying to myself. When I’m ready to take the final step of my plan, and save my sister, guess who walks through my front door? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, stand alone, unrequited love/second chance romance. &lt;br /&gt;Note: The book ends at 77% with samples of Predator and Protector. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Owen Gasnier is a gentleman even inside the Octagon. As much of a gentleman as one can be having an undisputed record with every win by a knock out. People LOVE him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overworked barista Tegan Holland doesn't know he exists. Not until ten minutes before her friend Fiona drags her to the biggest cage fight Sydney has ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time he heads back to his training camp in the States, she'll never forget him. But should she let him forget her? He's chasing his dream. He doesn't have time for her. Does he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Owen, the hits just keep coming. Trash talking opponents, sensationalist media, and someone's out to ruin him for good. He can't put Tegan in the middle of it. Can he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, will any of it matter? Cause life has other plans, and NOTHING hits harder than life.</description>

  <description>A missing barrister, a severed thumb and fat chance of finding out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Fitzwilliam’s world is about to spiral out of control. She’s not cut out to be a private investigator. With little or no aptitude for the job, she’s been sent undercover to expose the hidden lives of two men who meet nearly every week at Buxham’s - a private members’ club where portions are large and secrets are held in strictest confidence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those men is Harry Drysdale, a defence barrister, and the other is Marcus Carver, an eminent surgeon with a tarnished past and much to lose. Ella knows he has unhealthy appetites, she’s sure he’s feeding his perverted habits and putting his female patients at risk but she has to prove it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harry Drysdale goes missing, Konrad Neale TV journalist tries to reveal the truth behind the lies, but some of the secrets start to reveal themselves… and they are big.</description>

  <description>After a lifetime of being tailed by her father’s bodyguards, Keira Shaughnessy just wants her freedom and independence, and to bond with her long-lost brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a quest to outrun her past, she turns to illegal street racing. She loves the rush, the hint of danger, and living just on the edge of losing control. The last thing she needs is a detective tailing her, no matter how hot he is or how much she’s tempted to kiss him. Again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Deacon Ramsey runs into Keira at a street race, he knows he should stay away. She’s reckless. Dangerous. A perfect storm. He can’t afford to blow his cover. And he’s not convinced that the daughter of a ruthless criminal can be trusted. But when Keira’s past catches up to her, Deacon just might be the only one who can save her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I was his weakness. He was my strength. Until I destroyed him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was infatuated with Shane Wilder since the first time I saw him surfing. But we couldn’t be together. Not yet, anyway. I was too young and screwed up. He was too focused on chasing his dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we became friends. We met on the rooftop for late-night confessions under the stars. Cruised along the Pacific Coast Highway with the wind in our hair and the sun on our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took photos of all the beautiful and ugly and interesting things, while he traveled the world in search of the perfect waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him I would wait for him. &lt;br /&gt;I never meant to lie.&lt;br /&gt;I never meant to ruin his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Destroyed. Him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his star faded, mine burned bright. But as everyone knows, all that glitters is not gold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m back after seven long years, hoping for a chance to right my wrongs and fix what I’ve broken. This time I can only hope that loving Shane Wilder will be enough to save him.</description>

  <description>What would you do for the one you love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Me? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I traded my freedom for hers.&lt;br /&gt;But then she betrayed me and left me to rot without so much as a goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;You know how they say you need to forgive and forget?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; I won't.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I'm good with never laying eyes on Kenzie Michaels again.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, life has other plans.&lt;br /&gt;So when the woman who ripped my heart out of my chest - and stomped on it for good measure - shows up in my town, I'm left dealing with feelings both old and new.&lt;br /&gt;And a single question that rules my every thought: Do I give in and fight for the future we were supposed to have?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Secrets from his past have scarred his heart. Can he trust her enough to learn to love again?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the eyes of the law, I’d atoned for the secrets of my past, but in my heart, I knew the debt I owed was too big to ever be repaid. I didn’t ask for forgiveness, because I knew I wasn’t worthy of it. Guilt weighed me down and scarred my heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it wasn’t for my art, I’d probably be dead. The truth was, I had nothing else to live for. Or so I thought until Octavia Douglas came breezing unexpectedly into the picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy, stubborn, and smart enough to know better than to throw her future away on a guy like me, Vivi made me question everything I thought I already knew. I suddenly craved the happy ever after I’d never dared dream of, and knew I didn’t deserve.</description>

  <description>How deep undercover will these two go to catch the bad guy? Pose as a newly married couple. How hard can that be? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Agent Vin Mills has everything he’s ever wanted. Sweet job. Rock hard abs. An ass you can bounce a coin off of. And a money laundering mob boss who’s about to go down. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing standing in his way is fresh off the desk bombshell in heels, Special Agent Addison Buckley. She’s just destined to screw everything up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addison Buckley has one thing she wants—a promotion. The only thing standing in her way is egotistical and tattooed hottie, Vin Mills. The department wants them to pose as newlyweds and blend with the residents in one of the most prestigious and nosy neighborhoods in Colorado. A few touches, a few kisses, no problem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying and doing are two different things, and this is one game of espionage these two rivals never bargained for. &lt;br /&gt;Will these NewlyFEDS be able to catch the bad guys, or get caught under cover first?</description>

  <description>Wealth and power make them untouchable.&lt;br /&gt;The monarchs of Trinity Academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falcon Reyes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a sharp, intelligent look, he reeks of arrogance wrapped in an icy layer of indifference.&lt;br /&gt;A life of luxury has left him with the notion that everything is attainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power. Wealth. Status.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a god and I a mere mortal. &lt;br /&gt;He’s Jupiter, and I am Mercury. &lt;br /&gt;There’s so much power in this man. &lt;br /&gt;He has the kind of influence most people can’t even begin to imagine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And me… I’m an eighteen-year-old girl who managed to make him lose control. &lt;br /&gt;I’m the girl who showed him there’s a kaleidoscope of colors outside the high walls of his black and white world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Book 1 in The Trinity Academy Series. &lt;br /&gt;All 3 books are interconnected, and some plots are carried over to the next 2 books in this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#ColledgeRomance #Billionare #RichKids #NewAdult</description>

It’s so easy to sit back and judge people by their financial status, but we know money doesn’t bring health or happiness.

  <description>Willow Olivia Walker is a newly single Cambridge University student heading home for the summer holidays, following a bitter split with her controlling and manipulative ex-girlfriend, Kristina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially dismayed to discover her eccentric parents have hired the beautiful Georgia as a live-in nanny for her two younger sisters, she treads carefully, but slowly, a friendship blossoms that has the potential to bloom into something special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovered in flagrante by her over-bearing mother, Willow packs her bags and returns to Cambridge, intent on spending the remainder of the summer months preparing for the academic year ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter between Willow and barely separated university professor, Francesca Marten, is the start of a friendship that extends beyond the confines of student and teacher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Francesca, Willow finds a lover who knows what she wants, but for Francesca, Willow is the epitome of the young, carefree girl she left behind twenty years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Willow and Francesca’s friendship blossoms, danger lurks around the corner, as somebody is watching their every move, intent on revenge for what they perceive as the ultimate betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Willow, Francesca, and a host of others dig deeper to find the tormenter threatening to derail their future paths.</description>

  <description>Book 2 of the Father/Son Duet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laid my husband to rest....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott was my world and my future. His love for me transcended the dimensions of time and space—having made provisions for me in the event of his death. He was after all in a war zone and the odds were high he may not come home. But now I can’t help but think about the new man in my life – my husband’s father.&lt;br /&gt;Maguire creates a desire deep inside of me I never knew existed. This is more than lust. I keep on asking myself the same question. Have I fallen in love with him because he's so much like my late husband or because he's his own man? Only time will tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, you can't choose love, it chooses you.</description>

  <description>Book 1 of The Father/Son Duet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said good-bye to my son. But he had one final request—a letter I’ll never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Dad,&lt;br /&gt;If you're reading this, it means I'm gone. I had one dream, growing old with Holland. Death won't stop me from providing for my wife. And because you're the best man I know, what I'm about to ask—my last request—I know you'll do. Please take care of Holland. Take her back to California with you. It's a lot—I know. But, I’m placing my most precious possession in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Love, &lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the thoughts swirling through my mind are certainly not what my late son had in mind. How do I resist this woman in front of me? &lt;br /&gt;After all, you can't choose love, it chooses you.</description>

  <description>Gifted artist. Drug addict. A beautiful liar with the soul of a poet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connor Vincent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, my foolish heart believed that my love would be strong enough to fix him.&lt;br /&gt;How very wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;We soared to the greatest heights and crashed to the lowest depths together.&lt;br /&gt;Starting over wasn’t possible.&lt;br /&gt;Yet here he was, heart in hand, asking for another chance.&lt;br /&gt;Only a fool would agree.&lt;br /&gt;But when it comes to Connor, I’ve always been a fool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My muse. My bluebird of happiness. The cunning thief who stole my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ava Christensen&lt;/b&gt; had been the best thing in my life, but I ruined us.&lt;br /&gt;One more chance to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;I would show her that I’ve changed. I’m not hell-bent on self-destruction anymore. I won’t be careless with her. Not again.&lt;br /&gt;This time everything will be different.&lt;br /&gt;But once again my past catches up to me, and I’ll have to prove that I’m stronger than my addiction. Stronger than my secrets and lies. Strong enough to be the man she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;No more secrets. No more lies.&lt;br /&gt;They say that truth is beauty … they’re lying.</description>

  <description>In life, you always learn one important lesson you won’t ever forget.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it was to never have hopes and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;They could shatter into a million pieces in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I’d managed to live by that one rule almost my entire life, until the day Harper and her little boy moved in next door.&lt;br /&gt;One look into her guarded eyes and a flame of hope was lit.&lt;br /&gt;Little did I know, her green eyes held more pain than my heart did. And breaking through the fortified walls she’d erected around hers would cause me more agony than I’d ever imagined possible.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know if two broken and bruised individuals could come together and create something beautiful out of nothing but shattered pieces.&lt;br /&gt;But I needed to find out.</description>

Two months with Mr. tall, dark, and broody didn’t seem like a bad trade-off for the money he would pay me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the weeks go by, our attraction grows and I realize what a concerned and caring father he is. And he learns that not every woman is untrustworthy like his ex-wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We both agree to walk away from our fling when I leave for college at the end of summer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And reluctantly, we do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until my first day of classes when he crashes back into my world. &lt;br /&gt;“I’m Professor Decker. Welcome to King University.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Depravity&lt;/i&gt; is part of the &lt;i&gt;King University&lt;/i&gt; series, but can be read as a complete standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[First book in the King University Series and although I enjoyed it, I found it to be a bit slow. Many endearing characters, connections to other series and introductions to future books in the series. Some moments were truly worth treasuring in the book...I swooned through the romantic gestures....]]>

  <description>From Audie Award winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Kylie Scott comes an irresistible new romance - available in audio first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a vicious attack leaves 25-year-old Clementine Johns with no memory, she's forced to start over. Now she has to figure out who she was and why she made the choices she did - which includes leaving the supposed love of her life, tattoo artist Ed Larsen, only a month before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed can hardly believe it when his ex shows up at his tattoo parlor with no memory of their past, asking about the breakup that nearly destroyed him. The last thing he needs is more heartache, but he can't seem to let her go again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should they walk away for good, or does their love deserve a repeat performance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 6 hours and 47 minutes&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A second chance romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you fall for the boy next door?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea Norwood had the market on normal.&lt;br /&gt;Drama free life? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A single-mother who doubled as her confidant and partner in crime? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A neighbor and best friend she trusted more than anyone? Check.&lt;br /&gt;But that was until the day her mother remarried. The day that changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend's cousin, Liam Falcon, is sent to live with his aunt and uncle to clean up his act, Bea finds herself falling for the boy next door. With their hearts so infinitely entwined, Bea turns to Liam as her only escape from her new step-brother's daily torment at home. Bea thought their love could conquer anything. But she was wrong. Love was for fools, and she was the biggest fool of them all. When Liam left Lakeport, he took her heart with him, shattering the organ to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, Liam takes a trip back to Lakeport to visit his family, and to see HER.&lt;br /&gt;His first love.&lt;br /&gt;The girl who holds his heart.&lt;br /&gt;The same girl who shattered it six years ago without looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam is hell-bent on seeing Bea again after six years, but what he finds tears his heart in half. Bea Norwood is a shell of the girl he fell in love with. Underneath the baggy clothes, and pale skin, he knows she's still in there somewhere, he just needs to find her. &lt;br /&gt;Liam will stop at nothing to win his girl back, but sometimes, ignorance is bliss, and Liam isn't prepared for Bea's truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains themes of abuse. May cause triggers.</description>

  <description>Ryan &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Decades of personal demons, I thought I had successfully suppressed, were beginning to tear at me again. Wounds I never even realized I had, were opening. I ached for something more. Something deeper. And I had a feeling that Russell, the “Top of all Tops,” the so-called “Dom’s Dom” just might have the answers to helping me find what I so desperately needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Russell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Curiosity and the hope for something more put him on the doorstep of my home. Ryan Hudson. I said I was willing to mentor him as he began to explore his darker longings. I know I'm asking the impossible by asking him to let go. To trust me. But that is precisely what draws me to this beautifully scarred young man. The challenge. As for my darker longings where he's concerned...well, I will just have to steel my heart against those...for now... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Russell said that I needed to trust him, but could I do that? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryan had nothing left to lose, but possibly everything to gain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is our story… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Author’s note: Steel is a dark novel with intense scenes that may trigger some readers. Please read with caution.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is Sarah B Meadows debut novel and she’s made quite a splash. We all have varying tastes and maybe fantasy isn’t your genre, well it isn’t my preferred genre either. However I thoroughly enjoyed this book but I’m not really sure which genre it slots into. They all come from different lands a...]]>

  <description>I like to think of myself as the good guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kind of man that will take a beating or a bullet for my brothers and not think twice about it. But anyone that knows my story has only seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg and my intentions sometimes resemble the Titanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's when I lose control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my best to love and respect everyone because some people need it more than others—even the ones that don't deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Gareth Bresett and the only thing that matters to me in this world is Bentlee Gains. I'll do everything I can to keep her safe from every evil in this world, including myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because while I like to think that I'm the good guy, I find more pleasure in taking out a mark than I do being in her arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of who that mark happens to be.</description>

  <description>What happens when you wake up one day to discover that you've been on autopilot your entire life? My life has always been more downs than ups. Good things rarely knocked on my door. But hard knocks never failed to kick my ass. Nothing good would ever happen to me.Or so I thought.In college I discovered women, and never looked back. But even though I was never alone, I was always lonely. I didn't know exactly what I needed. Only that I needed something more.Until I saw her. Then I knew. She was what I needed. We were perfect. Incendiary! We were going to be what happily ever afters were about! Or so I thought.Now I'm ten years older. A hundred years wiser. I have survived so many trials by fire, nothing could penetrate my scarred and jaded armor. Or so I thought.This is my story...**Author's note: Forged is a dark novel with intense scenes that may trigger some readers. Please read with caution.</description>

  <description>She danced innocently into my Dark embrace --and blinded me with her relentless Light. ~Sade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started as a project to continue the charitable works of her deceased father. But when Mercy finds the man she believes her dad intended to help, it turns into a game of pain, lust, and danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second Sade meets Mercy the do-gooder, his desires get busy plotting to condition her for his sadomasochistic appetites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything goes according to his plans until he finds himself tied up and at the mercy of this woman who is nothing like the victim he'd mistaken her for.</description>

  <description>As a sadomasochist, Sade just wants to get and give pain in manageable and somewhat legal doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Mercy wants is to walk in her father's footsteps--a man who sacrificed everything to save her from a life of abuse and suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mercy finds an envelope on her doorstep leading her to Sade, the result is a collision of pain and mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sade, Mercy's kindness is dessert for his sadism, and her strength has his masochism hot and begging. Exploiting both for his own pleasure is his plan until he realizes that Mercy's got her own game. And playing it requires something he's never had.</description>

  <description>Final book in The Southern Heroes Series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t play games. If I see something I want, I go for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my late wife passed away, I haven’t been attracted to another woman. That’s until I come face to face with Chloe Jordaan with her sassy mouth and larger than life personality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the complete opposite of me. &lt;br /&gt;I’m not afraid to commit, where Chloe’s the epitome of ‘Bad Girl.’ I’m rational and serious, where Chloe’s carefree and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She keeps reminding me we’re only friends with benefits, but I can’t stop myself from wanting to make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s everything I shouldn’t want but turns out to be exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the South African Bad Girl ever fall for the American Alpha Hero?</description>

  <description>He was everything she wasn’t looking for … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finding a naked rock star in my bed was not how I saw my new life starting. Especially when that rock star is Evan Wyld, guitarist of the hottest band on the planet, Dirty Texas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He looks dirty as sin with colorful tattoos, muscles and piercings in all the right places. Summer is about to heat up as I join Dirty Texas on their European tour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was everything he wasn’t ready for… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sienna Hayes is off limits, but ever since the blonde bombshell accidentally climbed into my bed, I’ve been fantasizing about the ways I could help her get over her ex. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She has baggage, but I’m known for being a good time. Maybe I can be her rebound, help put her back together again.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One little taste can’t hurt; can it?</description>

At least that was the case before he met Frankie, the stripper and best friend of his motorcycle club president’s ol’ lady. She seems to want nothing to do with him though. She’s not willing to leap right into bed like all the other chicks around. When he’s put in charge of some of the MC’s daily operations, Piston finds himself trying to put his selfishness aside for the betterment of the club. Can he control his temper and calm his lust long enough to get the job done and win the girl? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frankie is a dancer. It’s all she’s ever loved to do, and it’s the reason she left the academy and moved to Mississippi with her best friend, Tesla. Now, she’s struggling to understand the pitfalls and dangers surrounding the motorcycle club lifestyle. Bikers are in and out of the Calm’s Storm strip club every night, and she’s become good friends with most of them. Plus, she’s had her eye on Piston since he saved her life six months ago, but she can’t help thinking he’s no better than all the lowlifes her mom used to bring home. He’s a bad boy with only one thing on his mind. Yet, the intense way he stares at her, that smoldering look of his, and his confident but charming attitude are making it impossible for her to shake him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope never wanted to leave her strict religious community in the first place. She was once promised to The Reverend, and she was thrilled at the chance to be his bride until her father disappeared, and her mother forced her to run away in the middle of the night. Her life has been in shambles ever since, and she can’t help thinking she would have been better off if she remained at Red Chapel. Now that she has a daughter of her own, and the evil demons of the real world want to take her away, Hope finds herself running back to Red Chapel and its safety, security, and the chance to once again convince The Reverend that she should be his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bikers, strippers, cops, a casino crime lord, and a religious cult collide in Lust’s Rage, book 2 of the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC series.</description>

  <description>The heart revs harder with gasoline in the veins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tesla’s love for dancing runs deeper than her toleration of her father’s MC lifestyle. That’s why she left the Razorblade Tumbleweeds motorcycle club in the first place. The academy seemed like her best bet, but all that fire in her heart and hatred in her soul keeps her dancing in a fit of rage instead of elegant grace. Realizing she can’t escape her past, she heads home to try and face all the heartache she thought she’d left behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Link is the new President of his MC. It’s been years since Tesla, the princess to the Razorblade Tumbleweed throne, stomped out of his world on her way to dance for fancy rich folks under bright spotlights. Of course, when things didn’t work out, she headed home. Now, not only does he need to harness all those hidden desires, he also has to help her with her new strip club idea, which means pissing off the locals, the cops, a rival MC, and some sick and twisted reverend from a religious cult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rye is about to turn eighteen, and in his religious community of Red Chapel, that means he can start to choose his wives. Life seems good until he finds out the young woman he loves more than anything in the world is betrothed to The Reverend, their sadistic religious leader with an insatiable appetite for power, pain, and pleasure. His only escape seems to be that ruthless band of outlaws he’s always been warned about. If he can only convince Grace to join him and Link to accept him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bikers, strippers, and religious zealots collide to create the Calm’s Storm.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;From the international bestselling author comes the story of two people who find out that sometimes fate does step in and play it's part. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Lust. It drives people to do things they normally wouldn't." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whisper is a secret that keeps you safe in the dark. It may hold truth, but it may bring about pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eli said goodbye to love, he never counted on Gia. &lt;br /&gt;The darkened soul he'd kept hidden for far too long was tainted.&lt;br /&gt;And she was too beautiful, too innocent.&lt;br /&gt;But he didn't bank on the feisty beauty to tame the beast he held inside. &lt;br /&gt;Living with guilt and anger, he promises to never love again. &lt;br /&gt;But fate has other plans. &lt;br /&gt;Will Eli and Gia find a light in the dark? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*This is a dark erotic romance with BDSM elements. Due to scenes of an adult nature, this book is for 18+ ONLY.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;From the international bestselling author comes a dark, sinful story filled with steamy scenes and a rocky road that’s raw, unapologetic, and carnal.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Greed was my vice. A sin that led to my addiction.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love was not an option for Nate. He didn’t want it. Didn’t claim it. Until her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hid the monster from everyone, including myself. &lt;br /&gt;Emotions were firmly locked away. &lt;br /&gt;As much control as I had in my life, I could never control my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva exposed me. &lt;br /&gt;She begged and pleaded, &lt;br /&gt;and I swore I'd make her kneel. &lt;br /&gt;And when she finally did, &lt;br /&gt;I broke the only jewel I ever owned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*This is a dark erotic romance with BDSM elements. Due to scenes of an adult nature, this book is for 18+ ONLY.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Wow. This book is beautiful in a rough around the edges, raw, carnal, way. It will rip you open and make you feel so much."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; - The Reading Cat&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>"Maybe next time I kiss you, you'll be awake."  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a handsome man walks into her life, Ivy falls hard. He quickly fills her dreams at night, and her thoughts during the day. But, when dreams and reality blur, is a dangerous grey area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kian can't sleep at night, but watching Ivy as she slumbers has become his addiction -- even before he met her. </description>

  <description>Some lives end unfinished, and some transcend time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a horrific incident, Swayze finds herself trapped between two lives. Patchy memories and fear for her own safety thrust her into a gut-wrenching journey to uncover the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she let her dreams slip away to seek retribution and find the missing pieces to a puzzle that existed a lifetime ago? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m not going to watch you self-destruct. I’m not going to watch you fall in love with another man.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will she discover the only truth that matters? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epoch pushes the boundaries of what we believe and what we know. It redefines fate and proves that the only thing separating the heart and the soul is an infinite timeline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I think a part of you will be mine to love in every life.”</description>

  <description>“In another life, she was my forever.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected tragedy leaves Professor Nathaniel Hunt a widower alone with a newborn baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hires a nanny. She’s young, but well-qualified, with a simple life, a crazy name obsession, and a boyfriend she met at the grocery store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, he discovers she knows things about him—things that happened before she was born—like a hidden scar on his head, his favorite pizza, and how he cheated on a high school Spanish test. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She speaks familiar words and shares haunting memories that take him back to over two decades earlier when he lost his best friend in a tragic accident. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m afraid of what’s going to happen when you realize I’m not her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transcend is a sexy, mind-bending journey that uncovers possibilities, challenges beliefs, and begets the age-old question: is there life after death?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jeweleann.com/free-booksubscribe/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>He bought me, but not to touch or taste. He bought me to save me, and to atone for past sins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handsome and mysterious, he swoops in to offer me a new life, but this is no knight in shining armor. He’s cold, hardened by his past. But there’s an inferno underneath the ice, I can feel the heat each time he looks at me—each time he gives in to the desire between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I push to unleash the fire in his eyes, he shoves back harder each time. He’s merciless with his cruel words, telling me how naïve I am, how little I know of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’m stronger than he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we face down our demons from the past, I’ll prove which one of us was in need of saving, and which one of us is the savior.</description>

  <description>Lars Bradby was supposed to be my forever.&lt;br /&gt;That was before we found out he would become a father at the tender age of eighteen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, he’d watched me.&lt;br /&gt;For months, he’d wanted me.&lt;br /&gt;For weeks, he’d chased me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relentless and infuriating, he turned my stubborn heart into something pliable and weak. &lt;br /&gt;Sly and honest, he worked his way into my life as though he’d always planned to be the focal point of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In love and naive, even when our future seemed bleak, I believed in us. &lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken and desperate, I tore my bleeding heart from my chest, wanting only the best for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing so, our forever wasn’t just interrupted. It was chased away with one irreversible decision after another. &lt;br /&gt;And now, we could no longer see it beneath the heaping piles of debris we’d left in our wake.</description>

  <description>Gwen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stripped of all my own desires and wants when I was married to my ex-husband. I now carry a list with me—a list that will help me choose a man that will put me first in life. Then the storm cloud of an entitled millionaire appears in my life and knocks me off my axis. This man sends so many mixed signals, my body either quakes with anger or passion when I’m around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm his son's teacher and his tenant, but I find myself wanting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life is run with precision with little regard for others until a woman in crazy clothes challenges me to be a better father. She’s one of the few people that puts me in my place and maybe for this very reason—I want her more than I can articulate. With her failed marriage and list of requests she needs from her next partner, I know she’s my future. My life is less than perfect, and with it—baggage that follows me everywhere. Does she want my kind of crazy in her life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm her landlord and an a**hole, but I find myself wanting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? For starters, you must love coffee...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, 425 Madison Avenue is the perfect place to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each story is a complete standalone.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Lauren’s gap year is supposed to be about making extra money and figuring out what to do with the next phase of her life. Realistically, it’s a break between taking care of her alcoholic brother and certified insane mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She deserves to have some fun, and to find trouble. However, trouble follows Lauren, with its wicked sense of humor, and thought it would be fun to gift her two love interests, who happen to be rivals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her first gift is Jackson. Along with his notorious reputation, he is a cocky, self-righteous, sexy-as-hell actor, who doesn’t take no for an answer. They meet while he’s filming in her small town near New Orleans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cary is her second bequest. While he is equal in fame, looks, and fortune, his brotherly intentions toward Lauren are heartfelt. That’s the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two totally different men, with their own unique brand of trouble. But, they both have one thing in common, and Lauren will find out it isn’t only her.</description>

  <description>Hiding in Ocean’s Isle after being suspended from the force for two months, my hot, feisty, neighbor is the last person I should be interested in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the next thing I know, we keep running into each other, which lead to some pretty intense sexually-loaded moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not supposed to fall for her, especially knowing I’ll be going home in a week to face the mess I left behind. It’s just supposed to be a mind-blowing one-night stand.&lt;br /&gt;Then I walk into the precinct, and I meet the new psychologist. I sure as hell didn’t see it coming, and now I have to bare my soul to the woman who should’ve remained a fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping her at a distance is next to impossible, but knowing her life might be in danger if I give into the growing attraction between us, I have no choice but to keep pretending to be the playboy joker everyone thinks I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will I be able to keep resisting the powerful pull between us?&lt;br /&gt;Will I be able to hide her from the man who swore to destroy my life the way I destroyed his?&lt;br /&gt;Will I ever survive the consequences of that fatal night?</description>

Knowing each second she’s with him is a chance for her to completely forget about us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s okay. I’m everything wrong. I would only hurt her. Break her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine a knock at the door and it’s her. She’s crying. He cheated on her. She needs someone. She says she needs me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to fight this. I can’t let her fall for me the way I’ve fallen for her. I’m going to crush her worse than he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine her wanting a kiss. Begging with her eyes. I’m a strong man... but she’s... even stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One kiss.&lt;br /&gt;Two hearts.&lt;br /&gt;Three words...</description>

  <description>Stuffy heiress.&lt;br /&gt;Spoiled snob.&lt;br /&gt;Party girl.&lt;br /&gt;Rich b*tch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been called a lot of names in my short time on this earth, but I like to think I have thick skin. I keep my head down, ignore the tabloids, and devote my time to worthy causes. But no matter how much good I do, nothing and no one can fill the void in my heart. Because that’s what a void is, right? A bottomless hole of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one man has come close to scaling down the dark walls of my deepest self. We were doomed from the start—thrown together by circumstance, torn apart by uncertainty and fear. I wish I could erase the mark he left on me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dark prince. &lt;br /&gt;My forbidden desire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sebastian Bellizzi.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother’s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author's Note:&lt;/b&gt; The Reluctant Heiress is a companion novella. Although it can be read as a standalone, it includes characters and spoilers from The Reluctant Socialite.</description>

A well plotted story line and I fell in love with the characters. <br /><br />Imagine Cole’s surprise at finding a girl hidden in his trailer after a long drive home with a skittish horse.

  <description>Love’s fun… until it’s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alesha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First meeting I managed six words. &lt;br /&gt;That didn’t stop him looking. &lt;br /&gt;The next time, there were a few more, but that didn’t stop him from touching. &lt;br /&gt;Third time gets easier, but it didn’t stop her from looking or touching him. &lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the fourth time his words flowed, convincing me it’s not as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wanted him. &lt;br /&gt;But he wanted me.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll fight for what’s mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xavier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people look back and say there is that one day when their story changed.&lt;br /&gt;For me, there are two.&lt;br /&gt;The day I met Alesha. &lt;br /&gt;Her eyes, that timid smile, the nervousness. &lt;br /&gt;No woman before even comes close to the one I didn’t know I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is that other day, the one that changed everything in a way I couldn’t control. &lt;br /&gt;I promised to always protect her, but instead, I introduced her to my hell.&lt;br /&gt;Now only she can save me.</description>

  <description>KANE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wants to be my buddy. &lt;br /&gt;You know, the naked type—no strings attached, no awkwardness. &lt;br /&gt;Friends who are lovers but with no relationship hassles. &lt;br /&gt;To a man who has nothing to offer a woman except pleasure, it’s an offer too good to refuse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days of laughter and nights full of hot searing passion. &lt;br /&gt;It can’t last. I need it to end, my life depends on our demise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I miss her clothes on my bedroom floor. &lt;br /&gt;As she looks up at me from her knees, my heart … the distraction … I just can’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s here in front of me, so how do I keep her safe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LILLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy hotness! &lt;br /&gt;It’s a crime to be that good-looking, surely. It’s not just looks, I’m certain. &lt;br /&gt;His skills in the bedroom keep me awake dreaming of more. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t want to be attached, but I’m not ready to let him go. I come up with the perfect plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends with benefits, an arrangement with rules.&lt;br /&gt;F… buddies—his name and his rules. A name he takes seriously and lives up to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never known life to be this good but just as I fall under his spell, he’s gone.&lt;br /&gt;The rules say I should too. But I won’t because his love is worth fighting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m about to make him see that too.</description>

  <description>Two years. That’s the amount of time I’ve wasted lusting after Wyatt Douglas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He had me the moment he roared up on his bike and flashed his charismatic smile my way. I wanted to jump on, wrap my arms around him, and ride off into the sunset. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then my brother introduced him as his friend and crushed my short lived happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, we work together at World Class Wrestling and our storylines are intertwined. I have a strict rule I’ve always adhered to: never mix business with pleasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with each moment we spend together, avoiding that carefully drawn line is becoming more difficult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s an ongoing rumble between my heart and my head. Which one will win out in the end? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*can be read as a standalone* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gideon Masters is a wild god. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worshipped for his bold paintings as much as his divine looks, he’s the art world’s biggest celebrity. Under normal circumstances, our paths would never cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his extracurricular activities threaten a high-profile business deal, I’m forced to take him as a client. My task : keep him out of the tabloids for six months. Jobs, including mine, hang in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Gideon doesn’t want a publicist.&lt;br /&gt;He wants a new muse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I fall deeper under his sinful spell, a lifetime of secrets and carefully crafted lies unravels. Too late, I remember the sinister truths they protect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am already someone’s masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And the original artist wants me back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;Art of Sin&lt;/b&gt; is book one of a duet and ends on a cliffhanger. But don't worry, book two, &lt;b&gt;Sin of Love&lt;/b&gt; will be released March 28th! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This duet takes place in the world of the Vision Series but can be read as a standalone.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have never read this author’s books before but was drawn into this book by the title and the blurb. So glad I was, it took me a bit to get used to her writing style, past, present and it seemed I was missing something. Which I was because all is eventually revealed as you continue reading.

  <description>Luke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play the field, responsibility is not my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My humor pulls the chicks and annoys my family most days. &lt;br /&gt;It’s my defence to being treated as the stupid younger brother. &lt;br /&gt;Working the family business is wearing thin, so maybe it’s time for change. &lt;br /&gt;It turns out it’s not the kind of change I’m expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Zoe and why is she so familiar, yet so new? &lt;br /&gt;This strong, independent woman is driving me crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Working together means I can’t avoid her, not that I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something she is hiding, a past that haunts us both. &lt;br /&gt;Secrets can tear you apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we manage a forbidden romance, or will the hiding become too hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, a lifetime ago, changed my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping my way through men stopped me from remembering. &lt;br /&gt;I had the control, I made the choice. &lt;br /&gt;It gave me strength to move forward, to forget my past secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New job, new direction. &lt;br /&gt;Until he walks in, making me freeze and unable to breathe. &lt;br /&gt;What’s worse is that he’s my boss. &lt;br /&gt;This can’t happen, my lost love, here in my new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t hide forever. My past will catch up with me, secrets always do. &lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter not once but twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I just keep hiding, or is it time to bury my past once and for all?</description>

  <description>Grant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m in control at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commanding the family business, I need to be strong. &lt;br /&gt;Make decisions that keep my family wealthy. &lt;br /&gt;I need to protect them. That’s my role as the oldest. &lt;br /&gt;People listen, and follow when I speak; my personality demands it.&lt;br /&gt;Until I meet her …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life is about to change directions. &lt;br /&gt;I want her here with me, I need her… but instead I’ll push her away. &lt;br /&gt;Because her happiness means more than what I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking away takes every piece of control I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dancing is my life, my every breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living my life-long dream is so close I can taste it. &lt;br /&gt;A new beginning, time for change. &lt;br /&gt;They told me to give up – not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m determined and strong-willed. &lt;br /&gt;Nobody stands in my way or tells me what to do. &lt;br /&gt;Until I meet him…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His look steals my breath. &lt;br /&gt;He controls me with every touch. &lt;br /&gt;Being with him will change my direction, but being without him makes life simply unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing means I lose one forever, and I’m not sure I’ll survive that.</description>

  <description>I just published my first novel: Love Doctor. There’s one small problem—besides the fact it isn’t selling—my boss from Hell, Dr. Declan Sincock, Sex Therapist, was my muse. Let’s just say, I took some creative liberties with him…&lt;br /&gt;I never thought he’d know about it. &lt;br /&gt;And never in a million years did I think he’d read it. &lt;br /&gt;But he has, and he’s not happy. &lt;br /&gt;I should just quit, find a new job, but now I have another plan. Write what you know, right? Dr. Sincock is going to educate me on how to write hotter sex. He just doesn’t know it yet.</description>

  <description>Bors is hungry for revenge after one of his assignments spins out of control. Not only is he tortured by the man he was hired to murder, the president of a notorious and ruthless motorcycle club, but he’s also left in the care of the man’s deranged daughter, Ivy. And she knows exactly who is chained and at her mercy, the one she has wanted dead for three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During captivity, Bors witnesses what has become of Ivy’s life, and finds himself trapped between hatred and sorrow for his female tormentor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It only took one day for me to hate her more than my worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;Only took two to start planning her death. &lt;br /&gt;And only three… to fall in love with her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bors is an avenger. Especially Ivy’s.</description>

  <description>As a hitman for hire, Percivale is no stranger to violence. &lt;br /&gt;From the moment he saw Blossom Jaymes through the window of her bakery, he knew he was in too deep. Not only was she as sweet as her perfectly crafted treats, but she was a soft-spoken, golden-haired angel that shone like a bright beacon in his dark world. And Percivale didn’t deal in angels. He dealt in death and crime. The even bigger issue? Percivale’s next hit is on said sweet little baker who doesn’t seem to realize how much danger lurks around her with each passing day. &lt;br /&gt;If he doesn’t get the job done, who will? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Percivale has to decide what’s more important to him—the life of a woman who may very well be innocent or getting his revenge on the men who murdered his family—the lines become blurred. Morals are twisted and a deathly chase ensues that can only result in one thing—Blossom buried six feet under. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or can it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Percivale let his lust for revenge go in order to save Blossom from the bounty on her head, or will the power she unknowingly holds over him be what gets her killed?</description>

  <description>I’ve been betrayed. A hit gone wrong. I'm hurt and hunted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She helps me out of fear--an innocent snatched up in my bid to escape. I can’t let her live because she’s seen my face. &lt;br /&gt;No survivors. No witnesses. That’s a code I live by and one I’ve always upheld. Yet when it comes to my petal, she makes me hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to taste her and make her mine in the most primitive way. Ravage her. Devour her. Allowing my need for her to take hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsure of who to trust, I feel the enemy closing in. I should set her free, but I can't. I’ll discover who has a price on my head and I'll end them, meeting blood with blood, and bullet with bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would she still want me when she sees me kill? Or will it scare her off for good?</description>

  <description>Sorrow’s Queen &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorrow slips in quietly when no one is looking — just like I do. &lt;br /&gt;It robs them of life and joy — just like. &lt;br /&gt;Sorrow is a killer in the night, murdering hearts and leaving destruction in it’s wake — and so am I. &lt;br /&gt;I am Tristan Sorrow, I stole happiness, and now she is mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He came in in the dead of night to steal me, to take me home. He was sent to rob me of my happiness and murder my hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Creeping in in slowly, he was an unexpected twist in my tale. &lt;br /&gt;But he stole the wrong thing, he made me his Queen. &lt;br /&gt;Tristan Sorrow stole my heart — and my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every love story is written tragically in the blood of those who fell.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;International bestselling author, Dani René, brings you the first of thirteen stories in the brand new, highly anticipated Cavalieri Della Morte series. These are suspenseful romances that will leave you hungry for more!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My beast hungers to be satiated. And my beauty is the only one who can feed it.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world ravaged with violence, I still think about the beauty who was taken from me. I’ve turned rabid in her absence. The dormant beast she had tamed is ravenous, feeding on brutality and bloodshed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I focus on the kill, until Arthur confesses his trump card, shattering every hope I had of reclaiming her. Focused on the job at hand, I step into the lion’s den, only to find nothing is as it seems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My beast hungers to be satiated. &lt;br /&gt;And my beauty is the only one who can feed it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A dark treacherous journey where happily ever after may be just out of reach.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I was a teenager when I ran away to Las Vegas determined to make it on my own. The choice was easy—stay for an ordinary marriage or escape for an extraordinary life. I took a chance on myself, trusted in fate, and boarded the bus bound for the unknown. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the glitzy glamour of the showgirl scene, I entertained the famous, the elite, and the mafia. But what I never expected was the invitation from a mysterious stranger to land at my feet and invite me to explore my darkest desires. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the mob hot on my trail, I decided to use my well-honed, entrepreneurial skills to advance my game and play a better one than their own. I wasn’t just another pretty face, but a cunning, ruthless bitch hellbent on getting what I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My name is Anna Ford. &lt;br /&gt;This is my story. &lt;br /&gt;And how it all came to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Standalone. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They call him ‘Wilde Man’. Rumor has it he’s an animal on the ice and between the sheets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like the rest of the female population, I’ve been crushing on Clancy Wilde, the captain of Boston University’s hockey team, since the first time I saw him. Big, blond, and charming, he ticks all the boxes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we find ourselves at a wedding, drunk and flirting, I know I can finally check this tattooed, bad boy, hockey player off my wish list. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night is all it was meant to be, until I see two pink lines on the pregnancy test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How did the notch on my belt turn into a ball and chain?</description>

  <description>No one is innocent in the eyes of the Cavalieri Della Morte. &lt;br /&gt;If your name ends up on my list, your time is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets. No mercy. No conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the enemy becomes my twisted obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago, I paid a price to fulfill a vendetta. Twenty minutes ago, I threw it all away.&lt;br /&gt;Stolen in the night. Held against her will. Bound to a monster.&lt;br /&gt;I came to take her life but claimed it instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warn her not to trust men with sin on their lips and ice in their veins.&lt;br /&gt;She cautions me not to be deceived by my own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us listens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started out as a quest for retribution has become a game of survival.&lt;br /&gt;They say three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. &lt;br /&gt;Challenge accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;warning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be advised that Darkest Deeds is a very dark romance novel with possible triggers. If violence, illegal dealings, and people doing extremely bad things make you twitchy, this book may give you hives. You've been warned.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[It seems this series just keeps getting better. What a twisted tale was weaved, if you can keep up with the twists and turns you are better than me.

  <description>Zach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is full of chapters. &lt;br /&gt;It’s a book now containing past stories. &lt;br /&gt;Some good, some bad and one full of trauma that I have buried.&lt;br /&gt;Then there’s new chapters you haven’t written yet. &lt;br /&gt;A simple life, success of the family business. Everything according to plan until that day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One single day that starts rewriting my chapters. &lt;br /&gt;It’s headed in a new direction I didn’t see coming. &lt;br /&gt;Walking into Emily’s tough life, three sets of sad eyes looking at me like I’m a knight in shining armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I explain I can’t be who they need and not break their hearts?&lt;br /&gt;They need me to save them…I need to protect my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My children are my world.&lt;br /&gt;Life’s hard as a single parent. &lt;br /&gt;A mom of twins who depend on me to keep them safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up believing in fairy tale romances a long time ago. &lt;br /&gt;In my world they don’t exist. &lt;br /&gt;Make your own new beginnings, my mom always told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day I struggle, but today’s barriers are just too hard to climb. &lt;br /&gt;Then an accidental chance moment. &lt;br /&gt;A hot wealthy guy knocking on my door, pulling my world out from under me. &lt;br /&gt;Life changes in heartbeat. Zach sweeps in, protecting my family. &lt;br /&gt;He shows my son, how to be the Alpha man I dream he’ll become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s full of sweet love, promising a new life full of sunshine and rainbows, but it’s a life minus him. Can I take being so close but never being on his side of the wall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard can I fight before I’ve got to walk away?</description>

  <description>I'm at the end of my rope, planning a wedding with the man who has become a threat to my sanity.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody tells lies, but no one knows the truth we hide behind closed doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s until Alec is hired to watch my every move. &lt;br /&gt;I thought the man threatening my mother’s life was my biggest problem. But he’s not. &lt;br /&gt;Alec Taylor’s sharp gaze and ruggedly beautiful smile are quickly becoming a danger to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accidental touch has me wondering what if.&lt;br /&gt;Little do I know he’d end up showing me the truth to the lie I’ve been living.&lt;br /&gt;What if I dare hope Alec is the one truth amongst all the lies I tell myself?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Temptation has never come in a hotter package.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how people say you can never believe what you read on the interwebs? That a hot guy online is probably a creeper with a beer gut and a shoe fetish, not the sexy beast he pretends to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had no clue that the anonymous blogger who contacted my law firm about his naughty website would be droolworthy in real life. Not that I'm interested in him in that way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attorneys can't go around sleeping with their clients. Not even if he is the most beautiful man I've ever met and so ridiculously smart he makes my nerdy-girl heart sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, he has too much on the line to risk taking a chance on the insane chemistry building between us. We both do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always followed the rules. Too bad he makes me want to break each and every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All About the D&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic comedy and a full-length standalone. Due to adult situations and sexual content, it's recommended for readers over the age of 18.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The girl next door. Pretty. Sweet. Kind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Submissive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I met her, I was alone with the dark desires that I didn't understand, that I couldn't reconcile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She became my best friend, and then she became so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desire. Disgust. Shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn’t have survived until college without her. When we were together, I was at peace for the first time in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was too good to last. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our appetite for pain and pleasure destroyed us. And all the drinks in the world weren’t enough to get used to missing her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the verge of earning my degree, Ana walks back into my life, those gray-blue eyes still able to see right through me. It’s the chance I’ve been waiting for. One last chance to overcome my shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only it were that easy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This world is evil.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My mother used to tell me that evil only comes to those who are looking for it, and maybe she was right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Corruption and death walk hand and hand in this town. I refuse to give in, but giving up seems to be my only option. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a detective, I’ve seen enough killing for ten lifetimes, and now, leaving is the only way to keep my sanity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never thought that my last case while training my replacement would have a stranglehold on me personally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s like the Hangman is placing the noose around my neck, and the rope is only getting tighter.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dear birthday gods,&lt;br /&gt;I’d like my very own Australian experience, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;One with a panty-melting accent and a very wicked grin.&lt;br /&gt;The icing on my birthday cake would be if he takes a trip down under tonight . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My birthday was four-hundred bucks well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get your mind out of the gutter—that was for the hotel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one week on, and I’m no longer having fun in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Because it turns out my new employer is &lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My inked birthday blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, he’s still hot,&lt;br /&gt;But now he’s growly and grouchy,&lt;br /&gt;And there's no escape because I’m living with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nanny to his young twins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We disagree on so much.&lt;br /&gt;But when he looks at me, &lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure if he means to kill me. Or kiss me&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m not sure I’d survive on either count.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia! &lt;br /&gt;Come for the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Stay for the man.

  <description>His name is Luke. But nobody knows that. He was an iconic musician before he gave up music. But nobody knows that either. They also don’t know he’s twenty-seven, that he used to have an infectious laugh, and that he’s way too young to be widowed. They certainly don’t know the rest of his tragic story. All they know is that he comes into their café at the same time every morning and stares at the same chair at the same table. They know he’s strange. They know he interrupts their breakfast with a cold blast of air as he hovers in the doorway, mustering the courage to confront a piece of furniture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one asks why. No one cares. He’s fine with that. He’s done with life. This isn’t even his story anymore. It’s actually Callie’s, the young writer who sat in his chair one day.</description>

      <![CDATA[What an emotional intro to this author! Encore, thankfully the next book is written. A unique look into depression and how it effects those around us. Whilst this is about a rock band it’s not your usual, parties, groupies and bad management. This book delves into the psyche of two of the members...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Attending King University was at the top of my bucket list. Falling in love with my professor wasn’t.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Earning a full scholarship to King University was my hard earned ticket out of hell. I'm happy to be away from the small town I grew up in and all the equally small minded people who live there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King was going to be my safe haven. A place where I could leave the old me behind and finally grow into the young man my family had desperately tried to hide away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diving head first into new experiences, new friends, and parties, I didn’t expect to run straight into the one thing I wasn’t ready for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His arms are welcoming, his body is addictive and his lips are heaven. Cole Huxley is everything I could fall in love with, except for one problem... I never wanted to fall for my professor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Devilry is part of the King University Series, but can be read as a complete standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Playboy. &lt;br /&gt;Gym rat. &lt;br /&gt;Womanizer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been called them all. &lt;br /&gt;Until one-night changes everything. Changes me. &lt;br /&gt;Trying to drown a broken heart in cheap whiskey and a willing body leaves me with the last thing I ever expected. &lt;br /&gt;All that matters now is my son. There’s no room for anything, or anyone else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt;A free spirit. A nomadic soul. &lt;br /&gt;She intrigues me. She excites me. She’s everything I never knew I needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, loving her was the easy part. It was letting her go that almost ruined me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Struck is a surprise baby/single dad romance and can be read as a complete standalone. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My brother was right. I always wanted my own Willow Girl.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened on that island didn’t break me. &lt;br /&gt;It twisted me. &lt;br /&gt;Corrupted me.&lt;br /&gt;Made me into a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I guess it’s true what she says. You can’t become something that wasn’t inside you all along. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was always going to happen. &lt;br /&gt;I was always going to take Amelia Willow. &lt;br /&gt;History and destiny sealed her fate. Sealed both of ours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months, I’ve been waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Watching.&lt;br /&gt;Preparing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And tonight, everything will change. &lt;br /&gt;Because tonight, I’ll collect my own Willow Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author’s Note: Twisted is a standalone dark romance, no cliffhanger!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description> A new standalone romantic psychological thriller, from the author of the Falling Small Duet. &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Love stories don't usually start with tripping over a dead body.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mine did. That's when I met &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought taking pictures in the woods would be dangerous. Nothing ever happened that far out in no man's land. But when I stumbled upon a dead body and a man with a mysterious accent, I knew I was in over my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, choices aren’t simple. Sometimes, things aren’t as they seem. And now, I can’t tell if he’s my savior, or if I’m his prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your only choice is the devil you know or the devil you don’t…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you choose when it’s not just your life but your heart on the line too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**This book contains adult language and graphic sexual situations.**&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Fresh out of college and headed straight for my dream job, I didn’t think things could get any better.&lt;br /&gt;Then I met my dream man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an instant, my happy ever after had begun.&lt;br /&gt;The life I’d stumbled into was beautiful, and the man I loved was perfect. &lt;br /&gt;But perfection comes at a cost, and I’d slumbered through all the alarms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met my nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;The man whose bright eyes held untamed darkness. &lt;br /&gt;The man who disarmed me with his peculiar behavior. &lt;br /&gt;The man whose cold, merciless hands shook me awake. &lt;br /&gt;In an instant, questions started to dismantle my happy ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whoever said the truth would set you free was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t going to repair the cracks in my naive heart. &lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t going to caress my face with comforting hands and reassure me it was all just a dream.&lt;br /&gt;No, the truth shoved me down a rabbit hole, and I landed in the lair of a real-life monster.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; I'm still dead.&lt;/b&gt; I know how I died. And these four vampires can't get enough of me. But believe me, this is far from over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. The black figure is chasing me.&lt;br /&gt;2. I face the man who killed me.&lt;br /&gt;3. We face a darkness I never thought possible... hint: more vampires who are for some reason really mad at me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that's not enough, Seth, Layre, Darick, and Kryan want me to play "tag" ... naked. &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, things are going just fine being dead.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** WARNING: this is a wild and steamy reverse harem paranormal romance novel... read at your own risk. *** &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>She was untouchable. Until I got my hands on her... and got her pregnant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I knew Priya long before I was hired to be her bodyguard. And by the time my job comes to an end, it’s too late – I’ve gotten too close to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A little distance keeps things at bay, but not for long. My new lucrative car restoration business attracts the attention of the Reaper’s Bastards MC and I find myself in the mood to act like a wild outlaw. But there’s a catch – I’ll help them if they help me find Priya. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I get my hands on her again, we’re a family now. She gives birth to my son and life moves forward. Until the unthinkable happens. A shocking murder shakes our world to its core. Priya’s past is coming back not just to haunt, but to kill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the only way to survive is for me to become one of the bad guys…</description>
