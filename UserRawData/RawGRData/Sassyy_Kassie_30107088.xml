  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a stunning new voice in YA literature comes an epic, utterly unforgettable contemporary novel about a lost shipwreck, a missing piece of family history, and weathering the storms of life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Profound and page-turning."&lt;br /&gt;--Madeline Miller, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Circe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Larkin family isn't just lucky-they persevere. At least that's what Violet and her younger brother, Sam, were always told. When the Lyric sank off the coast of Maine, their great-great-great-grandmother didn't drown like the rest of the passengers. No, Fidelia swam to shore, fell in love, and founded Lyric, Maine, the town Violet and Sam returned to every summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wrecks seem to run in the family: Tall, funny, musical Violet can't stop partying with the wrong people. And, one beautiful summer day, brilliant, sensitive Sam attempts to take his own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped back to Lyric while Sam is in treatment, Violet is haunted by her family's missing piece-the lost shipwreck she and Sam dreamed of discovering when they were children. Desperate to make amends, Violet embarks on a wildly ambitious mission: locate the Lyric, lain hidden in a watery grave for over a century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She finds a fellow wreck hunter in Liv Stone, an amateur local historian whose sparkling intelligence and guarded gray eyes make Violet ache in an exhilarating new way. Whether or not they find the Lyric, the journey Violet takes-and the bridges she builds along the way-may be the start of something like survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epic, funny, and sweepingly romantic, The Last True Poets of the Sea is an astonishing debut about the strength it takes to swim up from a wreck.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She’s trying to break out of prison—even though if she succeeds, she’ll be the Commonwealth’s most wanted fugitive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit’s grandmother is missing. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother’s whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her &lt;i&gt;prisoner&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Suze is a mediator -- a liaison between the living and the dead. In other words, she sees dead people. And they won't leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business with the living. But Jesse, the hot ghost haunting her bedroom, doesn't seem to need her help. Which is a relief, because Suze has just moved to sunny California and plans to start fresh, with trips to the mall instead of the cemetery, and surfing instead of spectral visitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the very first day at her new school, Suze realizes it's not that easy. There's a ghost with revenge on her mind ... and Suze happens to be in the way.</description>

  <description>When Siddalee Walker, oldest daughter of Vivi Abbott Walker, Ya-Ya extraordinaire, is interviewed in the New York Times about a hit play she's directed, her mother gets described as a "tap-dancing child abuser." Enraged, Vivi disowns Sidda. Devastated, Sidda begs forgiveness, and postpones her upcoming wedding. All looks bleak until the Ya-Yas step in and convince Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of their girlhood mementos, called "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." As Sidda struggles to analyze her mother, she comes face to face with the tangled beauty of imperfect love, and the fact that forgiveness, more than understanding, is often what the heart longs for.</description>

  <description>Prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, Vincent Bugliosi held a unique insider's position in one of the most baffling and horrifying cases of the twentieth century: the cold-blooded Tate-LaBianca murders carried out by Charles Manson and four of his followers. What motivated Manson in his seemingly mindless selection of victims, and what was his hold over the young women who obeyed his orders? Here is the gripping story of this famous and haunting crime. 50 pages of b/w photographs.</description>

  <description>Callum is a naught, a second-class citizen in a society run by the ruling Crosses. Sephy is a Cross, and daughter of the man slated to become prime minister. In their world, white naughts and black Crosses simply don't mix -- and they certainly don't fall in love. But that's exactly what they've done. &lt;br /&gt; When they were younger, they played together. Now Callum and Sephy meet in secret and make excuses. But excuses no longer cut it when Sephy and her mother are nearly caught in a terrorist bombing planned by the Liberation Militia, with which Callum's family is linked. Callum's father is the prime suspect...and Sephy's father will stop at nothing to see him hanged. The blood hunt that ensues will threaten not only Callum and Sephy's love for each other, but their very lives. &lt;br /&gt; In this shocking thriller, UK sensation Malorie Blackman turns the world inside out. What's white is black, what's black is white, and only one thing is clear: Assumptions can be deadly.</description>

An LGBTQ+ graphic novel about life, love, and everything that happens in between: this is the second volume of HEARTSTOPPER, for fans of The Art of Being Normal, Holly Bourne and Love, Simon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick and Charlie are best friends.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore, and he's sort of got a boyfriend, even if he's kind of mean and only wants to meet up in secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. That is, until the start of January, in which Nick and Charlie are placed in the same form group and made to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Solitaire&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Radio Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a bind up of the first two chapters of Heartstopper, an &lt;a href="http://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ongoing webcomic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Therese watches her parents die. While in a coma, she meets the twin sons of Hades—Hypnos, the god of sleep, and Thanatos, the god of death. She thinks she's manipulating a dream, not kissing the god of death and totally rocking his world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Than makes a deal with Hades and goes as a mortal to the Upperworld to try and win Therese's heart, but not all the gods are happy. Some give her gifts. Others try to kill her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The deal requires Therese to avenge the death of her parents. With the help of Than’s fierce and exotic sisters, the Furies, she finds herself in an arena face to face with the murderer, and only one will survive.</description>

  <description>Warsaw, Poland. The year is 1940 and Lillia is 15 when her mother, Alenka, disappears and her father flees with Lillia and her younger sister, Naomi, to Shanghai, one of the few places that will accept Jews without visas. There they struggle to make a life; they have no money, there is little work, no decent place to live, a culture that doesn't understand them. And always the worry about Alenka. How will she find them? Is she still alive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile Lillia is growing up, trying to care for Naomi, whose development is frighteningly slow, in part from malnourishment. Lillia finds an outlet for her artistic talent by making puppets, remembering the happy days in Warsaw when they were circus performers. She attends school sporadically, makes friends with Wei, a Chinese boy, and finds work as a performer at a "gentlemen's club" without her father's knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But meanwhile the conflict grows more intense as the Americans declare war and the Japanese force the Americans in Shanghai into camps. More bombing, more death. Can they survive, caught in the crossfire?</description>

  <description>A hilarious graphic novel in which the human race has been supplanted by a sweeter, kinder, happier species...but are they as innocent as they seem? In this post-apocalyptic comedy, it's survival of the cutest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the most adorable apocalypse ever, the human race has vanished from the earth, replaced cute, innocent, playful purple creatures called the Puramus. In this hilarious and epic graphic novel, short interlocking stories follow the purple pals as they explore their new home, form a mini-monarchy, and develop a modern society on par with 21st-century humans. A final act pulls us across time and space in the search for clues to the origins of the Puramus. Along the way, humor and intrigue abound: Can King defend his village when nobody understands what war is? Will Jingle work up the nerve to read her poetry at open mic night? Will Puff Puff ever stop floating? Based on the viral Tumblr comic that gained 18,000 followers in just one year, We Are Here Forever is for fans of post-apocalyptic sci-fi blended with dry comedy and undeniable cuteness. Colorful and cartoony art will you rooting for these cute critters through their absurd adventures. But where did they come from, and what happened to all the humans?</description>

  <description>Asra is a demigod with a dangerous gift: the ability to dictate the future by writing with her blood. To keep her power secret, she leads a quiet life as a healer on a remote mountain, content to help the people in her care and spend time with Ina, the mortal girl she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Asra’s peaceful life is upended when bandits threaten Ina’s village and the king does nothing to help. Desperate to protect her people, Ina begs Asra for assistance in finding her manifest—the animal she’ll be able to change into as her rite of passage to adulthood. Asra uses her blood magic to help Ina, but her spell goes horribly wrong and the bandits destroy the village, killing Ina’s family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unaware that Asra is at fault, Ina swears revenge on the king and takes a savage dragon as her manifest. To stop her, Asra must embark on a journey across the kingdom, becoming a player in lethal games of power among assassins, gods, and even the king himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most frightening of all, she discovers the dark secrets of her own mysterious history—and the terrible, powerful legacy she carries in her blood.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the internationally bestselling authors of THE ILLUMINAE FILES comes an epic new science fiction adventure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2380, and the graduating cadets of Aurora Academy are being assigned their first missions. Star pupil Tyler Jones is ready to recruit the squad of his dreams, but his own boneheaded heroism sees him stuck with the dregs nobody else in the Academy would touch…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cocky diplomat with a black belt in sarcasm&lt;br /&gt;A sociopath scientist with a fondness for shooting her bunkmates&lt;br /&gt;A smart-ass techwiz with the galaxy’s biggest chip on his shoulder&lt;br /&gt;An alien warrior with anger management issues&lt;br /&gt;A tomboy pilot who’s totally not into him, in case you were wondering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ty’s squad isn’t even his biggest problem—that’d be Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley, the girl he’s just rescued from interdimensional space. Trapped in cryo-sleep for two centuries, Auri is a girl out of time and out of her depth. But she could be the catalyst that starts a war millions of years in the making, and Tyler’s squad of losers, discipline-cases and misfits might just be the last hope for the entire galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;They're not the heroes we deserve. They're just the ones we could find. Nobody panic.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>Ryann Bird dreams of traveling across the stars. But a career in space isn’t an option for a girl who lives in a trailer park on the wrong side of town. So Ryann becomes her circumstances and settles for acting out and skipping school to hang out with her delinquent friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day she meets Alexandria: a furious loner who spurns Ryann’s offer of friendship. After a horrific accident leaves Alexandria with a broken arm, the two misfits are brought together despite themselves—and Ryann learns her secret: Alexandria’s mother is an astronaut who volunteered for a one-way trip to the edge of the solar system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night without fail, Alexandria waits to catch radio signals from her mother. And its up to Ryann to lift her onto the roof day after day until the silence between them grows into friendship, and eventually something more . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In K. Ancrum’s signature poetic style, this slow-burn romance will have you savoring every page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Imprint Book</description>

      <![CDATA[Although i loved the set up of all our characters in this story, i found myself it never went deep enough. It felt a little too surface level for me in regards to all of this great characters that just weren’t flushed out enough for me. I found that i wasn’t emotionally invested by the end. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An extinct disease re-emerges from the melting Alaskan permafrost to cause madness in its victims. For recent apocalyptic cult escapee Wynter Roth, it’s the end she’d always been told was coming.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wynter Roth is turned out of New Earth, a self-contained doomsday cult on the American prairie, she emerges into a world poised on the brink of madness as a mysterious outbreak of rapid early onset dementia spreads across the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Wynter struggles to start over in a world she’s been taught to regard as evil, she finds herself face-to-face with the apocalypse she’s feared all her life—until the night her sister shows up at her doorstep with a set of medical samples. That night, Wynter learns there’s something far more sinister at play and that these samples are key to understanding the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the power grid fails and the nation descends into chaos, Wynter must find a way to get the samples to a lab in Colorado. Uncertain who to trust, she takes up with former military man Chase Miller, who has his own reasons for wanting to get close to the samples in her possession, and to Wynter herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a world free of bloodshed and war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is not that world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art student and monster's apprentice Karou finally has the answers she has always sought. She knows who she is—and &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; she is. But with this knowledge comes another truth she would give anything to undo: She loved the enemy and he betrayed her, and a world suffered for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/i&gt;, Karou must decide how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, secrets and impossible choices, &lt;i&gt;Days of Blood &amp;amp; Starlight&lt;/i&gt; finds Karou and Akiva on opposing sides as an age-old war stirs back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Karou and her allies build a monstrous army in a land of dust and starlight, Akiva wages a different sort of battle: a battle for redemption. For &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>Elouise (Lou) Parker is determined to have the absolute best, most impossibly epic summer of her life. There are just a few things standing in her way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * She's landed a job at Magic Castle Playland . . . as a giant dancing hot dog.&lt;br /&gt; * Her crush, the dreamy Diving Pirate Nick, already has a girlfriend, who is literally the Princess of the park. But Lou's never liked anyone, guy or otherwise, this much before, and now she wants a chance at her own happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt; * Her best friend, Seeley, the carousel operator, who's always been up for anything, suddenly isn't when it comes to Lou's quest to set her up with the perfect girl or Lou's scheme to get close to Nick.&lt;br /&gt; * And it turns out that this will be their last summer at Magic Castle Playland--ever--unless she can find a way to stop it from closing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Dugan's sparkling debut coming-of-age queer romance stars a princess, a pirate, a hot dog, and a carousel operator who find love--and themselves--in unexpected people and unforgettable places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A ruthless young assassin's journey for revenge comes to a stunning end in the conclusion of this acclaimed epic fantasy trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Republic of Itreya is in chaos. Mia Corvere has assassinated Cardinal Duomo and rumors of Consul Scaeva’s death ripple through the street of Godsgrave like wildfire. But buried beneath those same streets, deep in the ancient city’s bones, lies a secret that will change the Republic forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia and her brother Jonnen must journey through the depths of the ancient metropolis. Their quest will take them through the Godsgrave underdark, across the Sea of Swords, back to the library of the Quiet Mountain and the poisoned blades of Mia’s old mentors, and at last the fabled Crown of the Moon. There, Mia will at last discover the origins of the darkin, and learn the destiny that lies in store for her and her world. But with the three suns now in descent, and Truedark on the horizon, will she survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and internationally bestselling author Jay Kristoff’s writing has been praised by critics and readers alike and has won many awards, including five Aurealis Awards, an ABIA, and David Gemmell Morningstar and Legend awards.</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>The award-winning and bestselling classic memoir about a young Chicano gang member surviving the dangerous streets of East Los Angeles, now featuring a new introduction by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Carl Sandburg Literary Award, hailed as a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; notable book, and read by hundreds of thousands, &lt;i&gt;Always Running&lt;/i&gt; is the searing true story of one man’s life in a Chicano gang—and his heroic struggle to free himself from its grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By age twelve, Luis Rodriguez was a veteran of East Los Angeles gang warfare. Lured by a seemingly invincible gang culture, he witnessed countless shootings, beatings, and arrests and then watched with increasing fear as gang life claimed friends and family members. Before long, Rodriguez saw a way out of the barrio through education and the power of words and successfully broke free from years of violence and desperation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Achieving success as an award-winning poet, he was sure the streets would haunt him no more—until his young son joined a gang. Rodriguez fought for his child by telling his own story in &lt;i&gt;Always Running,&lt;/i&gt; a vivid memoir that explores the motivations of gang life and cautions against the death and destruction that inevitably claim its participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times heartbreakingly sad and brutal, &lt;i&gt;Always Running&lt;/i&gt; is ultimately an uplifting true story, filled with hope, insight, and a hard-earned lesson for the next generation.</description>

  <description>An orphan’s life is harsh—and often short—in the mysterious island city of Camorr. But young Locke Lamora dodges death and slavery, becoming a thief under the tutelage of a gifted con artist. As leader of the band of light-fingered brothers known as the Gentleman Bastards, Locke is soon infamous, fooling even the underworld’s most feared ruler. But in the shadows lurks someone still more ambitious and deadly. Faced with a bloody coup that threatens to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the enemy at his own brutal game—or die trying.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Keralie Corrington may seem harmless, but in fact, she's one of Quadara's most skilled thieves and a liar. Varin, on the other hand, is an honest, upstanding citizen of Quadara's most enlightened region, Eonia. Varin runs afoul of Keralie when she steals a package from him, putting his life in danger. When Varin attempts to retrieve the package, he and Keralie find themselves entangled in a conspiracy that leaves all four of Quadara's queens dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other choices and on the run from Keralie's former employer, the two decide to join forces, endeavoring to discover who has killed the queens and save their own lives in the process. When their reluctant partnership blooms into a tenuous romance, they must overcome their own dark secrets in hopes of a future together that seemed impossible just days before. But first they have to stay alive and untangle the secrets behind the nation's four dead queens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An enthralling fast-paced murder mystery where competing agendas collide with deadly consequences, &lt;i&gt;Four Dead Queens&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of an exciting new YA talent.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The mesmerizing adult debut from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Leigh Bardugo.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>The Prince and the Pauper gets a modern makeover in this adorable, witty, and heartwarming young adult novel set in the Geekerella universe by national bestselling author Ashley Poston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imogen Lovelace is an ordinary fangirl on an impossible mission: save her favorite character, Princess Amara, from being killed off from her favorite franchise, Starfield. The problem is, Jessica Stone—the actress who plays Princess Amara—wants nothing more than to leave the intense scrutiny of the fandom behind. If this year's ExcelsiCon isn't her last, she'll consider her career derailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a case of mistaken identity throws look-a-likes Imogen and Jess together, they quickly become enemies. But when the script for the Starfield sequel leaks, and all signs point to Jess, she and Imogen must trade places to find the person responsible. That's easier said than done when the girls step into each other's shoes and discover new romantic possibilities, as well as the other side of intense fandom. As these "princesses" race to find the script-leaker, they must rescue themselves from their own expectations, and redefine what it means to live happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>A magic passed down through generations . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgina Fernweh waits with growing impatience for the tingle of magic in her fingers—magic that has been passed down through every woman in her family. Her twin sister, Mary, already shows an ability to defy gravity. But with their eighteenth birthday looming at the end of this summer, Georgina fears her gift will never come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An island where strange things happen . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one on the island of By-the-Sea would ever call the Fernwehs what they really are, but if you need the odd bit of help—say, a sleeping aid concocted by moonlight—they are the ones to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one questions the weather, as moody and erratic as a summer storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one questions the (allegedly) three-hundred-year-old bird who comes to roost on the island every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A summer that will become legend . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When tragedy strikes, what made the Fernweh women special suddenly casts them in suspicion. Over the course of her last summer on the island—a summer of storms, of love, of salt—Georgina will learn the truth about magic, in all its many forms.</description>

  <description>The Renegades Trilogy continues, in this fiercely awaited second installment after the New York Times-bestselling Renegades by Marissa Meyer, author of the Lunar Chronicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;Together, they can save the world.&lt;br /&gt;But they each other's worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Renegades, Nova and Adrian (aka Insomnia and Sketch) fought the battle of their lives against the Anarchist known as the Detonator. It was a short-lived victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anarchists still have a secret weapon, one that Nova believes will protect her. The Renegades also have a strategy for overpowering the Anarchists, but both Nova and Adrian understand that it could mean the end of Gatlon City - and the world - as they know it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the realm of very scary faeries!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Kaye is a modern nomad. Fierce and independent, she travels from city to city with her mother's rock band until an ominous attack forces Kaye back to her childhood home. There, amid the industrial, blue-collar New Jersey backdrop, Kaye soon finds herself an unwilling pawn in an ancient power struggle between two rival faerie kingdoms - a struggle that could very well mean her death.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sharp, funny, and incredibly timely collection of personal essays, veteran video blogger and star of MTV's &lt;i&gt;Decoded&lt;/i&gt; Franchesca Ramsey explores race, identity, online activism, and the downfall of real communication in the age of social media rants, trolls, and call-out wars. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franchesca Ramsey didn't set out to be an activist. Or a comedian. Or a commentator on identity, race, and culture, really. But then her YouTube video "What White Girls Say. . . to Black Girls" went viral. Twelve million views viral. Faced with an avalanche of media requests, fan letters, and hate mail, she had two choices: Jump in and make her voice heard or step back and let others frame the conversation. After a crash course in social justice and more than a few foot-in-mouth moments, she realized she had a unique talent and passion for breaking down injustice in America in ways that could make people listen and engage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first book, Ramsey uses her own experiences as an accidental activist to explore the many ways we communicate with each other—from the highs of bridging gaps and making connections to the many pitfalls that accompany talking about race, power, sexuality, and gender in an unpredictable public space...the internet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, That Escalated Quickly&lt;/em&gt; includes Ramsey's advice on dealing with internet trolls and low-key racists, confessions about being a former online hater herself, and her personal hits and misses in activist debates with everyone from bigoted Facebook friends and misguided relatives to mainstream celebrities and YouTube influencers. With sharp humor and her trademark candor, Ramsey shows readers we can have tough conversations that move the dialogue forward, rather than backward, if we just approach them in the right way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a palace of illusions, nothing is what it seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each generation, a competition is held to find the next empress of Honoku. The rules are simple. Survive the palace’s enchanted seasonal rooms. Conquer Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. Marry the prince. All are eligible to compete—all except yōkai, supernatural monsters and spirits whom the human emperor is determined to enslave and destroy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mari has spent a lifetime training to become empress. Winning should be easy. And it would be, if she weren't hiding a dangerous secret. Mari is a yōkai with the ability to transform into a terrifying monster. If discovered, her life will be forfeit. As she struggles to keep her true identity hidden, Mari’s fate collides with that of Taro, the prince who has no desire to inherit the imperial throne, and Akira, a half-human, half-yōkai outcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between duty and love, loyalty and betrayal, vengeance and forgiveness, the choices of Mari, Taro, and Akira will decide the fate of Honoku in this beautifully written, edge-of-your-seat YA fantasy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Indulge your vices in the City of Sin, where a sinister street war is brewing and fame is the deadliest killer of them all...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the quest to find her missing mother, prim and proper Enne Salta became reluctant allies with Levi Glaisyer, the city’s most famous con man. Saving his life in the Shadow Game forced Enne to assume the identity of Seance, a mysterious underworld figure. Now, with the Chancellor of the Republic dead and bounties on both their heads, she and Levi must play a dangerous game of crime and politics…with the very fate of New Reynes at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirsting for his freedom and the chance to build an empire, Levi enters an unlikely partnership with Vianca Augustine’s estranged son. Meanwhile, Enne remains trapped by the mafia donna’s binding oath, playing the roles of both darling lady and cunning street lord, unsure which side of herself reflects the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Enne and Levi walk a path of unimaginable wealth and opportunity, new relationships and deadly secrets could quickly lead them into ruin. And when unforeseen players enter the game, they must each make an impossible choice: To sacrifice everything they’ve earned in order to survive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or die as legends.</description>

  <description>Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions—like grief. And love. He thinks he’s defective. His family knows better—that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can’t turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn’t go as planned. Esme’s lessons in love seem to be working…but only on herself. She’s hopelessly smitten with a man who’s convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Esme’s time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he’s been wrong all along. And there’s more than one way to love.</description>

  <description>Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. "A place" he said, "where learning is a game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.</description>

  <description>Five women. One question. What is a woman for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this ferociously imaginative novel, abortion is once again illegal in America, in-vitro fertilization is banned, and the Personhood Amendment grants rights of life, liberty, and property to every embryo. In a small Oregon fishing town, five very different women navigate these new barriers alongside age-old questions surrounding motherhood, identity, and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ro, a single high-school teacher, is trying to have a baby on her own, while also writing a biography of Eivør, a little-known 19th-century female polar explorer. Susan is a frustrated mother of two, trapped in a crumbling marriage. Mattie is the adopted daughter of doting parents and one of Ro's best students, who finds herself pregnant with nowhere to turn. And Gin is the gifted, forest-dwelling homeopath, or "mender," who brings all their fates together when she's arrested and put on trial in a frenzied modern-day witch hunt.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5/5 stars<br /><br />This book is very week written but I think I made a mistake and choosing to listen to the audio over reading physically. I found it hard to focus on the story as it is an epic and so it’s very long form. I feel like I ended up missing a lot due to this.<br /><br />I see why...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut novel of family, fame, and religion that tells the emotionally stirring, wildly captivating story of the seventeen-year-old daughter of an evangelical preacher, star of the family's hit reality show, and the secret pregnancy that threatens to blow their entire world apart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther Ann Hicks—Essie—is the youngest child on &lt;i&gt;Six for Hicks,&lt;/i&gt; a reality television phenomenon. She's grown up in the spotlight, both idolized and despised for her family's fire-and-brimstone brand of faith. When Essie's mother, Celia, discovers that Essie is pregnant, she arranges an emergency meeting with the show's producers: Do they sneak Essie out of the country for an abortion? Do they pass the child off as Celia's? Or do they try to arrange a marriage—and a ratings-blockbuster wedding? Meanwhile, Essie is quietly pairing herself up with Roarke Richards, a senior at her school with a secret of his own to protect. As the newly formed couple attempt to sell their fabricated love story to the media—through exclusive interviews with an infamously conservative reporter named Liberty Bell—Essie finds she has questions of her own: What was the real reason for her older sister leaving home? Who can she trust with the truth about her family? And how much is she willing to sacrifice to win her own freedom?</description>

  <description>Twin sisters Jack and Jill were seventeen when they found their way home and were packed off to Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of what happened first…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline was her mother’s perfect daughter—polite and quiet, always dressed as a princess. If her mother was sometimes a little strict, it’s because crafting the perfect daughter takes discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian was her father’s perfect daughter—adventurous, thrill-seeking, and a bit of a tom-boy. He really would have preferred a son, but you work with what you've got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were five when they learned that grown-ups can’t be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were twelve when they walked down the impossible staircase and discovered that the pretense of love can never be enough to prepare you a life filled with magic in a land filled with mad scientists and death and &lt;i&gt;choices&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[Okay this was so much better than Every Heart a Doorway in my opinion. I still think This series is way too short as far each book goes. Everything feels too rushed in my opinion and so i can’t give it 5 stars. But this story was great even with that issue. ]]>

  <description>On Christmas Eve five years ago, Holly was visited by three ghosts who showed her how selfish and spoiled she'd become. They tried to convince her to mend her ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's stuck working for the top-secret company Project Scrooge--as the latest Ghost of Christmas Past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, they save another miserly grouch. Every year, Holly stays frozen at seventeen while her family and friends go on living without her. So far, Holly's afterlife has been miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, everything is about to change. . . .</description>

  <description>The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Man Called Ove&lt;/i&gt; returns with a dazzling, profound novel about a small town with a big dream—and the price required to make it come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain. In this story of a small forest town, Fredrik Backman has found the entire world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final battle is here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people―but at a tremendous cost. Locked within an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve is unraveling with each passing day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Aelin captured, friends and allies are scattered to different fates. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. As destinies weave together at last, all must fight if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the making, Sarah J. Maas's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights to save herself―and the promise of a better world.</description>

  <description>There’s no such thing as safe in a city at war, a city overrun with monsters. In this dark urban fantasy from author Victoria Schwab&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a young woman and a young man must choose whether to become heroes or villains—and friends or enemies—with the future of their home at stake. The first of two books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided city—a city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father, who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human, as good-hearted as his own father, to play a bigger role in protecting the innocent—but he’s one of the monsters. One who can steal a soul with a simple strain of music. When the chance arises to keep an eye on Kate, who’s just been kicked out of her sixth boarding school and returned home, August jumps at it. But Kate discovers August’s secret, and after a failed assassination attempt the pair must flee for their lives.</description>

  <description>For Penny Lee high school was a total nonevent. Her friends were okay, her grades were fine, and while she somehow managed to land a boyfriend, he doesn’t actually know anything about her. When Penny heads to college in Austin, Texas, to learn how to become a writer, it’s seventy-nine miles and a zillion light years away from everything she can’t wait to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam’s stuck. Literally, figuratively, emotionally, financially. He works at a café and sleeps there too, on a mattress on the floor of an empty storage room upstairs. He knows that this is the god-awful chapter of his life that will serve as inspiration for when he’s a famous movie director but right this second the seventeen bucks in his checking account and his dying laptop are really testing him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sam and Penny cross paths it’s less meet-cute and more a collision of unbearable awkwardness. Still, they swap numbers and stay in touch—via text—and soon become digitally inseparable, sharing their deepest anxieties and secret dreams without the humiliating weirdness of having to &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; each other.</description>

  <description>For Teodora DiSangro, a mafia don’s daughter, family is fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All her life, Teodora has hidden the fact that she secretly turns her family’s enemies into music boxes, mirrors, and other decorative objects. After all, everyone in Vinalia knows that stregas—wielders of magic—are figures out of fairytales. Nobody believes they’re real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Capo, the land’s new ruler, sends poisoned letters to the heads of the Five Families that have long controlled Vinalia. Four lie dead and Teo’s beloved father is gravely ill. To save him, Teo must travel to the capital as a DiSangro son—not merely disguised as a boy, but transformed into one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cielo, a strega who can switch back and forth between male and female as effortlessly as turning a page in a book. Teo and Cielo journey together to the capital, and Teo struggles to master her powers and to keep her growing feelings for Cielo locked in her heart. As she falls in love with witty, irascible Cielo, Teo realizes how much of life she’s missed by hiding her true nature. But she can’t forget her mission, and the closer they get to the palace, the more sinister secrets they uncover about what’s really going on in their beloved country—and the more determined Teo becomes to save her family at any cost.</description>

  <description>A year ago, Flynn Cormac and Jubilee Chase made the now infamous Avon Broadcast, calling on the galaxy to witness for their planet, and protect them from destruction. Some say Flynn’s a madman, others whisper about conspiracies. Nobody knows the truth. A year before that, Tarver Merendsen and Lilac LaRoux were rescued from a terrible shipwreck—now, they live a public life in front of the cameras, and a secret life away from the world’s gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in the center of the universe on the planet of Corinth, all four are about to collide with two new players, who will bring the fight against LaRoux Industries to a head. Gideon Marchant is an eighteen-year-old computer hacker—a whiz kid and an urban warrior. He’ll climb, abseil and worm his way past the best security measures to pull off onsite hacks that others don’t dare touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sofia Quinn has a killer smile, and by the time you’re done noticing it, she’s got you offering up your wallet, your car, and anything else she desires. She holds LaRoux Industries responsible for the mysterious death of her father and is out for revenge at any cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a LaRoux Industries security breach interrupts Gideon and Sofia’s separate attempts to infiltrate their headquarters, they’re forced to work together to escape. Each of them has their own reason for wanting to take down LaRoux Industries, and neither trusts the other. But working together might be the best chance they have to expose the secrets LRI is so desperate to hide.</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An urgent and inspirational collection of essays by a diverse group of celebrities, activists, and artists about what feminism means to them, with the goal of helping readers come to their own personal understanding of the word.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminism has never been more deeply and widely embraced and discussed, but what exactly does the F word mean? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, personal stories from actors, writers, and activists explore the contradictions and complications at the heart of the movement. By bridging the gap between feminist hashtags and scholarly texts, these essays bring feminism into clear focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published in partnership with Girl Up, the UN Foundation's adolescent girl campaign, contributors include Hollywood superstars like Saoirse Ronan, activists like Alicia Garza, a founder of Black Lives Matter, and even fictional icons such as Bridget Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman has a different route to their personal understanding of feminism. This empowering collection shows how a diverse group of women found their voice, and it will inspire others to do the same.</description>

  <description>The sequel to VICIOUS, V.E. Schwab's first adult novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney once had Serena—beloved sister, betrayed enemy, powerful ally. But now she is alone, except for her thrice-dead dog, Dol, and then there's Victor, who thinks Sydney doesn't know about his most recent act of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor himself is under the radar these days—being buried and re-animated can strike concern even if one has superhuman powers. But despite his own worries, his anger remains. And Eli Ever still has yet to pay for the evil he has done.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, desire, and superpowers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor and Eli started out as college roommates—brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find—aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge—but who will be left alive at the end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt;, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 55 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.</description>

I think Christina Lauren did an awesome job getting in the head of Tanner as he tries to understand what it would mean to fall in love with someone whose religion won't accept them. This book was amazing, heartfelt, and at time...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second installment in the epic &lt;i&gt;Starbound&lt;/i&gt; trilogy introduces a new pair of star-crossed lovers on two sides of a bloody war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jubilee Chase and Flynn Cormac should never have met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee is captain of the forces sent to Avon to crush the terraformed planet's rebellious colonists, but she has her own reasons for hating the insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebellion is in Flynn's blood. Terraforming corporations make their fortune by recruiting colonists to make the inhospitable planets livable, with the promise of a better life for their children. But they never fulfilled their promise on Avon, and decades later, Flynn is leading the rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for any advantage in a bloody and unrelentingly war, Flynn does the only thing that makes sense when he and Lee cross paths: he returns to base with her as prisoner. But as his fellow rebels prepare to execute this tough-talking girl with nerves of steel, Flynn makes another choice that will change him forever. He and Lee escape the rebel base together, caught between two sides of a senseless war.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</description>

  <description>Michael is an atheist. So as he walks through the doors at St. Clare’s—a strict Catholic school—sporting a plaid tie, things can’t get much worse. His dad has just made the family move again, and Michael needs a friend. When a girl challenges their teacher in class, Michael thinks he might have found one, and a fellow nonbeliever at that. Only this girl, Lucy, is not just Catholic . . . she wants to be a priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lucy introduces Michael to other St. Clare’s outcasts, and he officially joins Heretics Anonymous, where he can be an atheist, Lucy can be an outspoken feminist, Avi can be Jewish and gay, Max can wear whatever he wants, and Eden can practice paganism. After an incident in theology class, Michael encourages the Heretics to go from secret society to rebels intent on exposing the school’s hypocrisies. When Michael takes one mission too far—putting the other Heretics at risk—he must decide whether to fight for his own freedom, or rely on faith, whatever that means, in God, his friends, or himself.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book as it’s so different from any other YA novel I’ve yet to read.<br />I resonates so much with Michael’s fury about moving. Although my experience wasn’t the same and didn’t last into my teens, i moved schools every single year up until 4th grade so as a young child I was...]]>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Molly Peskin-Suso knows all about unrequited love—she’s lived through it twenty-six times. She crushes hard and crushes often, but always in secret. Because no matter how many times her twin sister, Cassie, tells her to woman up, Molly can’t stomach the idea of rejection. So she’s careful. Fat girls &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a cute new girl enters Cassie’s orbit, and for the first time ever, Molly’s cynical twin is a lovesick mess. Meanwhile, Molly’s totally not dying of loneliness—except for the part where she is. Luckily, Cassie’s new girlfriend comes with a cute hipster-boy sidekick. Will is funny and flirtatious and just might be perfect crush material. Maybe more than crush material. And if Molly can win him over, she’ll get her first kiss &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; she’ll get her twin back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one problem: Molly’s coworker Reid. He’s an awkward Tolkien superfan with a season pass to the Ren Faire, and there’s absolutely no way Molly could fall for him. Right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father’s failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her father’s former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic—the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, she’ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Church’s halls, the bloody secrets of Mia’s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?</description>

  <description>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply atmospheric and ingeniously plotted, &lt;i&gt;The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle&lt;/i&gt; is a highly original debut that will appeal to fans of Kate Atkinson and Agatha Christie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also titled as The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>There is a dark secret that is hiding at the heart of New York City and diminishing the city’s magicians’ power in this fantasy thriller by acclaimed author Kat Howard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City, magic controls everything. But the power of magic is fading. No one knows what is happening, except for Sydney—a new, rare magician with incredible power that has been unmatched in decades, and she may be the only person who is able to stop the darkness that is weakening the magic. But Sydney doesn’t want to help the system, she wants to destroy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney comes from the House of Shadows, which controls the magic with the help of sacrifices from magicians.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

  <description>Lula Mortiz may be a bruja with healing powers, but after her family's battle in Los Lagos, she feels broken in a way she can't seem to fix. Then tragedy strikes when a bus crash leaves her friends and her boyfriend, Maks, dead. Desperate to reclaim normalcy, Lula invokes a dark spell to bring Maks back. It isn't until she hears that all of the bodies from the crash have gone missing that she realizes something is wrong. Lula has unwittingly raised an army of casi muertos--creatures between the living and dead--and they're hungry for freedom...which they can only achieve if Lula dies.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Abbi Waxman is both irreverent and thoughtful."--#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Emily Giffin &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the author of &lt;i&gt;The Garden of Small Beginnings&lt;/i&gt; returns with a hilarious and poignant new novel about four families, their neighborhood carpool, and the affair that changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any given moment in other people's houses, you can find...repressed hopes and dreams...moments of unexpected joy...someone making love on the floor to a man who is most definitely not her husband...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*record scratch*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the longtime local carpool mom, Frances Bloom is sometimes an unwilling witness to her neighbors' private lives. She knows her cousin is hiding her desire for another baby from her spouse, Bill Horton's wife is mysteriously missing, and now this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shock of seeing Anne Porter in all her extramarital glory, Frances vows to stay in her own lane. But that's a notion easier said than done when Anne's husband throws her out a couple of days later. The repercussions of the affair reverberate through the four carpool families--and Frances finds herself navigating a moral minefield that could make or break a marriage.</description>

  <description>It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.</description>

  <description>Here, in one volume: Marjane Satrapi's best-selling, internationally acclaimed graphic memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Satrapi's unforgettable childhood and coming of age within a large and loving family in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution; of the contradictions between private life and public life in a country plagued by political upheaval; of her high school years in Vienna facing the trials of adolescence far from her family; of her homecoming--both sweet and terrible; and, finally, of her self-imposed exile from her beloved homeland. It is the chronicle of a girlhood and adolescence at once outrageous and familiar, a young life entwined with the history of her country yet filled with the universal trials and joys of growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edgy, searingly observant, and candid, often heartbreaking but threaded throughout with raw humor and hard-earned wisdom--&lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning work from one of the most highly regarded, singularly talented graphic artists at work today.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not surprised in the least that this book was as amazing as expected. It’s really just raw to read a memoir like this. It’s hard to even try to imagine Marianne Satrapi’s experience as real life. Thank you to Marjane for sharing her story.]]>

  <description>Figuring out how to build and maintain healthy relationships - with your family, friends, romantically and with yourself - is a crucial part of being a teen. It's not easy though, particularly in a digital age where information and advice are so forthcoming it can be hard to know who or what to believe or trust. Porn is everywhere, sexting is the norm and messages about body image are highly mixed. Hannah combats this by tackling subjects ranging from masturbation and puberty to slut shaming and consent in an accessible, relatable and extremely honest way. She is unembarrassed about bringing little-discussed topics into the open, and as such empowers teens to have the confidence to conduct relationships on their terms, and in a way that they feel comfortable with.</description>

  <description>Dimple Shah has it all figured out. With graduation behind her, she’s more than ready for a break from her family, from Mamma’s inexplicable obsession with her finding the “Ideal Indian Husband.” Ugh. Dimple knows they must respect her principles on some level, though. If they truly believed she needed a husband right now, they wouldn’t have paid for her to attend a summer program for aspiring web developers…right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel is a hopeless romantic. So when his parents tell him that his future wife will be attending the same summer program as him—wherein he’ll have to woo her—he’s totally on board. Because as silly as it sounds to most people in his life, Rishi wants to be arranged, believes in the power of tradition, stability, and being a part of something much bigger than himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shahs and Patels didn’t mean to start turning the wheels on this “suggested arrangement” so early in their children’s lives, but when they noticed them both gravitate toward the same summer program, they figured, Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple and Rishi may think they have each other figured out. But when opposites clash, love works hard to prove itself in the most unexpected ways.</description>

  <description>A chilling debut thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Talented Mr Ripley&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin Reese has a hobby: he digs up murder victims. He buys stolen police files on serial killers, and uses them to find and dig up missing bodies. Calls in the results anonymously, taunting the police for their failure to do their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Sandra Whittal takes that a little personally. She’s suspicious of the mysterious caller, who she names the Finder. Maybe he’s the one leaving the bodies behind. If not, who’s to say he won’t start soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Whittal begins to zero in on the Finder, Martin makes a shocking discovery. It seems someone—someone lethal—is very unhappy about the bodies he’s been digging up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted by a cop, hunted by a killer. To escape and keep his family safe, Martin may have to go deeper into the world of murder than he ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Assistants&lt;/i&gt; comes another gutsy book about the importance of women taking the reins—except this time, when it comes to finding sexuality, pleasure, and love sometimes where you least expect it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Daniels is a perfection-seeking 28-year-old lawyer living the New York dream. She’s engaged to charming art curator Paul Michael, has successfully made her way up the ladder at a multinational law firm and has a hold on apartments in Soho and the West Village. Suffice it to say, she has come a long way from her Kentucky upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rug is swept from under Katie when she is suddenly dumped by her fiance, Paul Michael, leaving her devastated and completely lost. On a whim, she agrees to have a drink with Cassidy Price-a self-assured, sexually promiscuous woman she meets at work. The two form a newfound friendship, which soon brings into question everything Katie thought she knew about sex—and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Katie Met Cassidy&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic comedy that explores how, as a culture, while we may have come a long way in terms of gender equality, a woman’s capacity for an entitlement to sexual pleasure still remain entirely taboo. This novel tackles the question: Why, when it comes to female sexuality, are so few women figuring out what they want and then going out and doing it?</description>

  <description>It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspecters, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts. In fact, her best friend, Jacob, just happens to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Inspecters head to ultra-haunted Edinburgh, Scotland, for their new TV show, Cass—and Jacob—come along. In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil. Cass isn't sure about her new mission, but she does know the sinister Red Raven haunting the city doesn't belong in her world. Cassidy's powers will draw her into an epic fight that stretches through the worlds of the living and the dead, in order to save herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cinderella goes to the con in this fandom-fueled twist on the classic fairy tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part romance, part love letter to nerd culture, and all totally adorbs, Geekerella is a fairy tale for anyone who believes in the magic of fandom. Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt;, the classic sci-fi series she grew up watching with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; movie, she has to enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball, and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck (and her dad’s old costume), Elle’s determined to win…unless her stepsisters get there first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons—before he was famous. Now they’re nothing but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he’s ever wanted, but the &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, Darien feels more and more like a fake—until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</description>

  <description>About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Practical Magic&lt;/i&gt; meets Nova Ren Suma’s &lt;i&gt;Imaginary Girls&lt;/i&gt; and Laura Ruby’s &lt;i&gt;Bone Gap&lt;/i&gt; in this lush, atmospheric new novel by acclaimed author Katrina Leno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A magic passed down through generations. An island where strange things happen. A summer that will become legend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgina Fernweh waits impatiently for the tingle of magic in her fingers—magic that has touched every woman in her family. But with her eighteenth birthday looming, Georgina fears her gift will never come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of her last summer on the island—a summer of storms, falling in love, and the mystery behind one rare three-hundred-year-old bird—Georgina will learn the truth about magic, in all its many forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Summer of Salt&lt;/i&gt;, Katrina Leno weaves another gorgeously original novel of magical realism and coming-of-age. Fans of April Genevieve Tucholke and Anna-Marie McLemore will be swept away.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

Poetry is not my forte and I'm glad I was able to hear the creator's true intention of how it should sound.<br /><br />This book is gorgeous. It's painful.

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>This provocative and relevant young adult novel is about Winter, a one-time National Spelling Bee Champ with a bright future ahead of her. That all changes after she haphazardly writes a racially offensive tweet that she thought was a harmless joke. What unfolds is a barrage of Internet shaming and rejection from her community and closest friends. Winter seeks to redeem herself, but first must come to terms with what she wrote and understand why there was so much backlash.</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Avery Armisted is athletic, rich, and pretty. Sixteen-year-old Kayla Butts is known as “butt-girl” at school. The two girls were friends as little kids, but that’s ancient history now. So it’s a huge surprise when Avery’s father offers to bring Kayla along on a summer trip to Spain. Avery is horrified that her father thinks he can choose her friends—and make her miss soccer camp. Kayla struggles just to imagine leaving the confines of her small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in Spain, the two uncover a secret their families had hidden from both of them their entire lives. Maybe the girls can put aside their differences and work through it together. Or maybe the lies and betrayal will only push them—and their families—farther apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A spellbinding novel about an unspeakable secret that could destroy a family, from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Finding Emma&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle is a survivor. She’s managed to piece together a solid life from a childhood of broken memories and fairy tales her mom told her to explain away bad dreams. But weekly visits to her mother still fill Elle with a paralyzing fear she can’t explain. It’s just another of so many unanswered questions she grew up with in a family estranged by silence and secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle’s world turns upside down when she receives a deathbed request from her grandfather, a man she was told had died years ago. Racked by grief, regrets, and a haunted conscience, he has a tale of his own to tell Elle: about her mother, an imaginary friend, and two strangers who came to the house one night and never left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Elle’s past unfolds, so does the truth—if she can believe it. She must face the reasons for her inexplicable dread. As dark as they are, Elle must listen…before her grandfather’s death buries the family’s secrets forever.</description>

  <description>What does it mean to live a life that's illegal, to be born into a community where you don't belong? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Andrew accepted a volunteer placement in Gambia after college. Sheltered and shy, he wanted a change from his well-to-do suburban life. At first, things went as planned. He did good work, made friends, and started to break out of his shell. But then, unexpectedly, he meets Thomas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas is a charming hotel bartender. Having run away from his homophobic village, he understands all too well how unforgiving his country can be to people like himself. He has one friend and nowhere safe to be who he is. Then, unexpectedly, he meets Andrew. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Order of Nature follows Andrew and Thomas as they navigate an environment where their love is illegal. At first, they believe it’s possible to develop a relationship in even the most trying circumstances. But as their relationship strengthens, the homophobia that envelops them becomes more hostile; the politics of prejudice catches up. Exposed and arrested, they are forced to confront what it means when your existence is considered a crime, your love against the order of nature.</description>

  <description>Shy aspiring artist Imogene Chively has just had a successful Season in London, complete with a suitor of her father's approval. Imogene is ambivalent about the young gentleman until he comes to visit her at the Chively estate with his younger brother in tow. When her interest is piqued, however, it is for the wrong brother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming Ben Steeple has a secret: despite being an architectural apprentice, he has no drawing aptitude. When Imogene offers to teach him, Ben is soon smitten by the young lady he considers his brother's intended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hiding their true feelings becomes the least of their problems when, after a series of "accidents," it becomes apparent that someone means Ben harm. And as their affection for each other grows—despite their efforts to remain just friends—so does the danger. . .</description>

  <description>'Everybody likes everything these days. The whole world is a nerd.'&lt;br /&gt;'Are you mad because other people like Star Wars? Are you mad because people like me like Star Wars?' &lt;br /&gt;'Maybe.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you broke Elena's heart, Star Wars would spill out. So when she decides to queue outside her local cinema to see the new movie, she's expecting a celebration with crowds of people who love Han, Luke and Leia just as much as she does. What she's not expecting is to be last in a line of only three people; to have to pee into a collectible Star Wars soda cup behind a dumpster or to meet that unlikely someone who just might truly understand the way she feels. Kindred Spirits is an engaging short story by Rainbow Rowell, author of the bestselling Eleanor &amp;amp; Park, Fangirl and Carry On, and is part of a handful of selected short reads specially produced for World Book Day.</description>

  <description>You can't spell truth without Ruth.&lt;br /&gt;Only Ruth Bader Ginsburg can judge me.&lt;br /&gt;The Ruth will set you free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg never asked for fame she was just trying to make the world a little better and a little freer. But along the way, the feminist pioneer's searing dissents and steely strength have inspired millions. Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, created by the young lawyer who began the Internet sensation and an award-winning journalist, takes you behind the myth for an intimate, irreverent look at the justice's life and work. As America struggles with the unfinished business of gender equality and civil rights, Ginsburg stays fierce. And if you don't know, now you know.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where, two centuries ago, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters’ return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only Penny sees what others cannot. And she will be forced to choose: save Bo, or save herself.</description>

  <description>Mila Flores and her best friend Riley have always been inseparable. There's not much excitement in their small town of Cross Creek, so Mila and Riley make their own fun, devoting most of their time to Riley's favorite activity: amateur witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Riley and two Fairmont Academy mean girls die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Riley, June, and Dayton have no recollection of their murders, but they do have unfinished business to attend to. Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Bone Gap is full of gaps—gaps to trip you up, gaps to slide through so you can disappear forever. So when young, beautiful Roza went missing, the people of Bone Gap weren’t surprised. After all, it wasn’t the first time that someone had slipped away and left Finn and Sean O’Sullivan on their own. Just a few years before, their mother had high-tailed it to Oregon for a brand new guy, a brand new life. That’s just how things go, the people said. Who are you going to blame?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finn knows that’s not what happened with Roza. He knows she was kidnapped, ripped from the cornfields by a dangerous man whose face he cannot remember. But the searches turned up nothing, and no one believes him anymore. Not even Sean, who has more reason to find Roza than anyone, and every reason to blame Finn for letting her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we follow the stories of Finn, Roza, and the people of Bone Gap—their melancholy pasts, their terrifying presents, their uncertain futures—acclaimed author Laura Ruby weaves a heartbreaking tale of love and loss, magic and mystery, regret and forgiveness—a story about how the face the world sees is never the sum of who we are.</description>

      <![CDATA[A nice quick children’s read but i think sometimes the story went a bit too quick or was a bit too disjointed. I wanted more exploration of the worlds we saw and the main character, even Aunt Beast and Happy Medium. It’s like everything is just a blip, even the climactic scene that suddenly ends...]]>

  <description>Rowan and Citra take opposite stances on the morality of the Scythedom, putting them at odds, in the chilling sequel to the Printz Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Scythe&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Neal Shusterman, author of the Unwind dystology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Thunderhead cannot interfere in the affairs of the Scythedom. All it can do is observe—it does not like what it sees.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year has passed since Rowan had gone off grid. Since then, he has become an urban legend, a vigilante snuffing out corrupt scythes in a trial by fire. His story is told in whispers across the continent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Scythe Anastasia, Citra gleans with compassion and openly challenges the ideals of the “new order.” But when her life is threatened and her methods questioned, it becomes clear that not everyone is open to the change.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will the Thunderhead intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or will it simply watch as this perfect world begins to unravel?</description>

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heroes will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>When Lauren and Ryan’s marriage reaches the breaking point, they come up with an unconventional plan. They decide to take a year off in the hopes of finding a way to fall in love again. One year apart, and only one rule: they cannot contact each other. Aside from that, anything goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren embarks on a journey of self-discovery, quickly finding that her friends and family have their own ideas about the meaning of marriage. These influences, as well as her own healing process and the challenges of living apart from Ryan, begin to change Lauren’s ideas about monogamy and marriage. She starts to question: When you can have romance without loyalty and commitment without marriage, when love and lust are no longer tied together, what do you value? What are you willing to fight for?</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In an anthology of revolution and resistance, a sisterhood of YA writers shines a light on a century and a half of heroines on the margins and in the intersections.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To respect yourself, to love yourself—should not have to be a radical decision. And yet it remains as challenging for an American girl to make today as it was in 1927 on the steps of the Supreme Court. It's a decision that must be faced whether you're balancing on the tightrope of neurodivergence, finding your way as a second-generation immigrant, or facing down American racism even while loving America. And it's the only decision when you've weighed society's expectations and found them wanting. In &lt;i&gt;The Radical Element&lt;/i&gt;, twelve of the most talented writers working in young adult literature today tell the stories of the girls of all colors and creeds standing up for themselves and their beliefs—whether that means secretly learning Hebrew in early Savannah, using the family magic to pass as white in 1920s Hollywood, or singing in a feminist punk band in 1980s Boston. And they're asking you to join them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gangs of New York&lt;/i&gt; meets Cassandra Clare in this debut YA fantasy set in 1882 Brooklyn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York, 1882. A dark, forbidding city, and no place for a girl with unexplainable powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Avery Kohl pines for the life she had before her mother was taken. She fears the mysterious men in crow masks who locked her mother in the Tombs asylum for being able to see what others couldn’t. Avery denies the signs in herself, focusing instead on her shifts at the ironworks factory and keeping her inventor father out of trouble. Other than secondhand tales of adventure from her best friend, Khan, an ex-slave, and caring for her falcon, Seraphine, Avery spends her days struggling to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like her mother’s, Avery’s powers refuse to be contained. When she causes a bizarre explosion at the factory, she has no choice but to run from her lies, straight into the darkest corners of the city. Avery must embrace her abilities and learn to wield their power—or join her mother in the cavernous horrors of the Tombs. And the Tombs has secrets of its own: strange experiments are being performed on “patients”…and no one knows why.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sarai has lived and breathed nightmares since she was six years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She believed she knew every horror and was beyond surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice—save the woman he loves, or &lt;i&gt;everyone else?&lt;/i&gt;—while Sarai feels more helpless than ever. But is she? Sometimes, only the direst need can teach us our own depths, and Sarai, the Muse of Nightmares, has not yet discovered what she's capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and godspawn reel in the aftermath of the citadel's near fall, a new foe shatters their fragile hopes, and the mysteries of the Mesarthim are resurrected: Where did the gods come from, and why? What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and hate, revenge and redemption, destruction and salvation all clash in this astonishing and heart-stopping sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Strange the Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>On a floating junkyard beneath a radiation sky, a deadly secret lies buried in the scrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve isn’t looking for secrets—she’s too busy looking over her shoulder. The robot gladiator she’s just spent six months building has been reduced to a smoking wreck, and the only thing keeping her Grandpa from the grave was the fistful of credits she just lost to the bookies. To top it off, she’s discovered she can destroy electronics with the power of her mind, and the puritanical Brotherhood are building a coffin her size. If she’s ever had a worse day, Eve can’t remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eve discovers the ruins of an android boy named Ezekiel in the scrap pile she calls home, her entire world comes crashing down. With her best friend Lemon Fresh and her robotic conscience, Cricket, in tow, she and Ezekiel will trek across deserts of irradiated glass, infiltrate towering megacities and scour the graveyard of humanity’s greatest folly to save the ones Eve loves, and learn the dark secrets of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if those secrets were better off staying buried.</description>

  <description>Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At seventeen she’s already lost more than most people lose in a lifetime. But she’s learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don’t have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every new scar hardens Charlie’s heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge.</description>

  <description>They killed my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They took our magic.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to bury us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers and her growing feelings for an enemy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone... except the villains they once overthrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this stand-alone companion to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone series comes the story of Mik and Zuzana's fantastical first date—as a gorgeously illustrated gift edition with bonus content included.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her "rabid fairy," her "voodoo eyes" are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or "Violin Boy," her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to make the first move, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It's a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter's night before leading him to the treasure: herself! Violin Boy is not going to know what hit him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laini Taylor brings to life a night only hinted at in the Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone trilogy—the magical first date of fan-favorites Zuzana and Mik. Originally published as an ebook, this new print edition will include breathtaking black and white illustrations, plus bonus content in a gorgeous package perfect for new and current fans of the series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ellie Frias disappeared long before she vanished.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tormented throughout middle school, Ellie begins her freshman year with a new look: she doesn't need to be popular; she just needs to blend in with the wallpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the unthinkable happens, Ellie finds herself trapped after a brutal assault. She wasn't the first victim, and now she watches it happen again and again. She tries to hold on to her happier memories in order to get past the cold days, waiting for someone to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, no one searches for a girl they never noticed in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Thou shalt kill.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no misery. Humanity has conquered all those things, and has even conquered death. Now scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are commanded to do so, in order to keep the size of the population under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that neither wants. These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.</description>

  <description>When Marvin Johnson's twin, Tyler, goes to a party, Marvin decides to tag along to keep an eye on his brother. But what starts as harmless fun turns into a shooting, followed by a police raid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, Tyler has gone missing, and it's up to Marvin to find him. But when Tyler is found dead, a video leaked online tells an even more chilling story: Tyler has been shot and killed by a police officer. Terrified as his mother unravels and mourning a brother who is now a hashtag, Marvin must learn what justice and freedom really mean.</description>

  <description>When Suzette comes home to Los Angeles from her boarding school in New England, she isn't sure if she'll ever want to go back. L.A. is where her friends and family are (along with her crush, Emil). And her stepbrother, Lionel, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, needs her emotional support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she settles into her old life, Suzette finds herself falling for someone new...the same girl her brother is in love with. When Lionel's disorder spirals out of control, Suzette is forced to confront her past mistakes and find a way to help her brother before he hurts himself--or worse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Solicitations&lt;br /&gt;No Visitors&lt;br /&gt;No Quests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost.</description>

  <description>When Adam Blake lands the best elective ever in his senior year, serving as an aide to the school psychologist, he thinks he’s got it made. Sure, it means a lot of sitting around, which isn’t easy for a guy with ADHD, but he can’t complain, since he gets to spend the period texting all his friends. Then the doctor asks him to track down the troubled freshman who keeps dodging her, and Adam discovers that the boy is Julian—the foster brother he hasn’t seen in five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam is ecstatic to be reunited. At first, Julian seems like the boy he once knew. He’s still kindhearted. He still writes stories and loves picture books meant for little kids. But as they spend more time together, Adam realizes that Julian is keeping secrets, like where he hides during the middle of the day, and what’s really going on inside his house. Adam is determined to help him, but his involvement could cost both boys their lives…</description>

  <description>Henry “Monty” Montague was born and bred to be a gentleman, but he was never one to be tamed. The finest boarding schools in England and the constant disapproval of his father haven’t been able to curb any of his roguish passions—not for gambling halls, late nights spent with a bottle of spirits, or waking up in the arms of women or men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Monty embarks on his Grand Tour of Europe, his quest for a life filled with pleasure and vice is in danger of coming to an end. Not only does his father expect him to take over the family’s estate upon his return, but Monty is also nursing an impossible crush on his best friend and traveling companion, Percy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it isn’t in Monty’s nature to give up. Even with his younger sister, Felicity, in tow, he vows to make this yearlong escapade one last hedonistic hurrah and flirt with Percy from Paris to Rome. But when one of Monty’s reckless decisions turns their trip abroad into a harrowing manhunt that spans across Europe, it calls into question everything he knows, including his relationship with the boy he adores.</description>

In the wake of the tragic death of Livia Blackthorn, the Clave teeters on the brink of civil war. One fragment of the Blackthorn family flees to Los Angeles, seeking to discover the source of the disease that is destroying the race of warlocks. Meanwhile, Julian and Emma take desperate measures to put their forbidden love aside and undertake a perilous mission to Faerie to retrieve the Black Volume of the Dead. What they find in the Courts is a secret that may tear the Shadow World asunder and open a dark path into a future they could never have imagined. Caught in a race against time, Emma and Julian must save the world of Shadowhunters before the deadly power of the &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt; curse destroys them and everyone they love.</description>

  <description>"I need Owen to explain this. Because yes, I do know that Owen would never do that, but I also know Hannah would never lie about something like that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara and Owen are about as close as twins can get. So when Mara's friend Hannah accuses Owen of rape, Mara doesn't know what to think. Can the brother she loves really be guilty of such a violent crime? Torn between the family she loves and her own sense of right and wrong, Mara is feeling lost, and it doesn't help that things have been strained with her ex-girlfriend and best friend since childhood, Charlie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mara, Hannah, and Charlie navigate this new terrain, Mara must face a trauma from her own past and decide where Charlie fits in her future. With sensitivity and openness, this timely novel confronts the difficult questions surrounding consent, victim blaming, and sexual assault.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the &lt;i&gt;City of Sin,&lt;/i&gt; where casino families reign, gangs infest the streets…and secrets hide in every shadow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enne Salta was raised as a proper young lady, and no lady would willingly visit New Reynes, the so-called City of Sin. But when her mother goes missing, Enne must leave her finishing school—and her reputation—behind to follow her mother’s trail to the city where no one survives uncorrupted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frightened and alone, Enne has only one lead: the name Levi Glaisyer. Unfortunately, Levi is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the gentleman she expected—he’s a street lord and a con man. Levi is also only one payment away from cleaning up a rapidly unraveling investment scam, so he doesn't have time to investigate a woman leading a dangerous double life. Enne's offer of compensation, however, could be the solution to all his problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their search for clues leads them through glamorous casinos, illicit cabarets and into the clutches of a ruthless Mafia donna. As Enne unearths an impossible secret about her past, Levi's enemies catch up to them, ensnaring him in a vicious execution game where the players always lose. To save him, Enne will need to surrender herself to the city…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she’ll need to play.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Leave it to the heroes to save the world--villains just want to &lt;i&gt;rule&lt;/i&gt; the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unique YA anthology, thirteen acclaimed, bestselling authors team up with thirteen influential BookTubers to reimagine fairy tales from the oft-misunderstood villains' points of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fractured, unconventional spins on classics like "Medusa," &lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt;, and "Jack and the Beanstalk" provide a behind-the-curtain look at villains' acts of vengeance, defiance, and rage--and the pain, heartbreak, and sorrow that spurned them on. No fairy tale will ever seem quite the same again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring writing from . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors: Renée Ahdieh, Ameriie, Soman Chainani, Susan Dennard, Sarah Enni, Marissa Meyer, Cindy Pon, Victoria Schwab, Samantha Shannon, Adam Silvera, Andrew Smith, April Genevieve Tucholke, and Nicola Yoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BookTubers: Benjamin Alderson (Benjaminoftomes), Sasha Alsberg (abookutopia), Whitney Atkinson (WhittyNovels), Tina Burke (ChristinaReadsYA blog and TheLushables), Catriona Feeney (LittleBookOwl), Jesse George (JessetheReader), Zoë Herdt (readbyzoe), Samantha Lane (Thoughts on Tomes), Sophia Lee (thebookbasement), Raeleen Lemay (padfootandprongs07), Regan Perusse (PeruseProject), Christine Riccio (polandbananasBOOKS), and Steph Sinclair &amp;amp; Kat Kennedy (Cuddlebuggery blog and channel).</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would you trade your soul mate for your soul?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Shadowhunter’s life is bound by duty. Constrained by honor. The word of a Shadowhunter is a solemn pledge, and no vow is more sacred than the vow that binds &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, warrior partners—sworn to fight together, die together, but never to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Carstairs has learned that the love she shares with her &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, Julian Blackthorn, isn’t just forbidden—it could destroy them both. She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it. Spurred on by a dark bargain with the Seelie Queen, Emma; her best friend, Cristina; and Mark and Julian Blackthorn journey into the Courts of Faerie, where glittering revels hide bloody danger and no promise can be trusted. Meanwhile, rising tension between Shadowhunters and Downworlders has produced the Cohort, an extremist group of Shadowhunters dedicated to registering Downworlders and “unsuitable” Nephilim. They’ll do anything in their power to expose Julian’s secrets and take the Los Angeles Institute for their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Downworlders turn against the Clave, a new threat rises in the form of the Lord of Shadows—the Unseelie King, who sends his greatest warriors to slaughter those with Blackthorn blood and seize the Black Volume. As dangers close in, Julian devises a risky scheme that depends on the cooperation of an unpredictable enemy. But success may come with a price he and Emma cannot even imagine, one that will bring with it a reckoning of blood that could have repercussions for everyone and everything they hold dear.</description>

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834816-ruin-and-rising" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alternative Cover Edition #1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The capital has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the nation's fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova's amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling's secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction—and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she’s fighting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Moxie girls fight back!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Carter is fed up. Fed up with her small-town Texas high school that thinks the football team can do no wrong. Fed up with sexist dress codes and hallway harassment. But most of all, Viv Carter is fed up with always following the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viv’s mom was a punk rock Riot Grrrl in the ’90s, so now Viv takes a page from her mother’s past and creates a feminist zine that she distributes anonymously to her classmates. She’s just blowing off steam, but other girls respond. Pretty soon Viv is forging friendships with other young women across the divides of cliques and popularity rankings, and she realizes that what she has started is nothing short of a girl revolution.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adam Silvera reminds us that there’s no life without death and no love without loss in this devastating yet uplifting story about two people whose lives change over the course of one unforgettable day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 5, a little after midnight, Death-Cast calls Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio to give them some bad news: They’re going to die today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mateo and Rufus are total strangers, but, for different reasons, they’re both looking to make a new friend on their End Day. The good news: There’s an app for that. It’s called the Last Friend, and through it, Rufus and Mateo are about to meet up for one last great adventure—to live a lifetime in a single day.</description>

But she can't outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling's game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her--or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Siege and Storm &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in The Grisha Trilogy by Leigh Bardugo. Book one, &lt;i&gt;Shadow and Bone&lt;/i&gt;, is a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, and book 3, &lt;i&gt;Ruin and Rising&lt;/i&gt;, is an Amazon Best Book of the Year and a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestseller. This title has Common Core connections, and this deluxe paperback edition features bonus materials like an interview with Leigh Bardugo, a bonus short story, "The Tailor," and more.</description>

  <description>Comedians Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson started Guys We F*cked: The Anti Slut-Shaming Podcast in 2013, intending to interview guys they'd slept with to learn more about themselves and squash the stigma so often associated with sexual women. As the podcast grew, and Corinne and Krystyna got to know their fans, stories of sexual assault, verbal and emotional abuse, and crippling shame became common topics of discussion along with those humorous conversations highlighting overall sexual confusion among many adults. The podcast is now an community of over a million listeners worldwide, and a place where any and all taboo sex topics are discussed freely, both with celebrity guests and the real people in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their new book, F*cked, follows that model, as Corinne and Krystyna bring a mix of raw, ridiculous, and serious sexual conversation to the page that will include topics like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why shame is completely made up and how we can stop giving into it&lt;br /&gt;Sexual exploration and how it sometimes ends in a trip to the ER&lt;br /&gt;Stuff we should stop doing: Snooping, nitpicking our bodies, and faking orgasms&lt;br /&gt;Asking your sexual partner uncomfortable questions&lt;br /&gt;How to get yourself out of an unsafe situation&lt;br /&gt;Masturbation, threesomes, porn, sex toys, butt stuff&lt;br /&gt;And much, much more&lt;br /&gt;Corinne and Krystyna are tired of books that pander to women like they’re hot messes, unable to handle their emotions without the assistance of a man, a glass of rosé, and a Xanax. This book will teach the reader, be they male, female, transgender or undecided, that you deal with sh*t, you brush your shoulder off, and you move the f*ck on. In a society where it has, for some reason, become chic to be the victim, they say this pity party ends now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a guide to love and sex for women who drink whiskey because they like it, not because it’s a cute thing to say on your Tinder profile. It has no trigger warnings because life doesn’t come with those. It won’t talk down to you or coddle you because you’re better than that. Corinne and Krystyna aren’t going to explain why he’s just not that into you, because it doesn’t f*cking matter. Despite what television, Rom-Coms, and glossy magazines tell you, you’re fine all by yourself. This is the book Bridget Jones should’ve read instead of writing that sh*tty diary in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834723-shadow-and-bone" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alternative Cover Edition #1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by enemies, the once-great nation of Ravka has been torn in two by the Shadow Fold, a swath of near impenetrable darkness crawling with monsters who feast on human flesh. Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A glorious empire . . .&lt;br /&gt;A desperate quest . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaol Westfall and Nesryn Faliq have arrived in the shining city of Antica to forge an alliance with the Khagan of the Southern Continent, whose vast armies are Erilea's last hope. But they have also come to Antica for another purpose: to seek healing at the famed Torre Cesme for the wounds Chaol received in Rifthold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enduring unspeakable horrors as a child, Yrene Towers has no desire to help the young lord from Adarlan, let alone heal him. Yet she has sworn an oath to assist those in need—and will honor it. But Lord Westfall carries shadows from his own past, and Yrene soon comes to realize they could engulf them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sweeping parallel novel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Empire of Storms&lt;/i&gt;, Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene will have to draw on every scrap of their resilience if they wish to save their friends. But while they become entangled in the political webs of the khaganate, deep in the shadows of mighty mountains where warriors soar on legendary ruks, long-awaited answers slumber. Answers that might offer their world a chance at survival—or doom them all . . .</description>

  <description>Grace wants out. Out of her house, where her stepfather wields fear like a weapon and her mother makes her scrub imaginary dirt off the floors. Out of her California town, too small to contain her big city dreams. Out of her life, and into the role of Parisian artist, New York director—anything but scared and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gavin: charming, talented, adored. Controlling. Dangerous. When Grace and Gavin fall in love, Grace is sure it's too good to be true. She has no idea their relationship will become a prison she's unable to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply affecting and unflinchingly honest, this is a story about spiraling into darkness—and emerging into the light again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two girls. One Kingdom. No way out..&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Princess. Royal. Prisoner.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Jade is the heir to the throne, but her mother, the Queen, isn’t willing to give up her title— ever. Queen Katrina doesn’t see her daughter as her legacy, but as a threat that has to be stopped. Jade has never left the palace, and is trapped inside its boundaries… but she wonders if the walls are meant to keep her safe, or keep her imprisoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Peasant. Pauper. Savior.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Nova left the Kingdom of Sterling before she could crawl— now that she’s returned with her father to rescue her orphaned cousin, it’s nothing short of a nightmare. Magic is used to control the people, and the monarchy is a dictatorship. Within the kingdom, Nova is hunted for a power she doesn’t even know she has… yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;One boy will intertwine their lives— or tear them apart.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Chael is the secretive and handsome royal guard that might have the answers to save both girls, but he’s hiding something dark. An ally with questionable motives, both Nova and Jade have no choice but to trust Chael… and to fall for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the lengths the Queen will employ to secure her crown are unforgivable. In the Kingdom of Sterling, the only thing more powerful than betrayal is magic. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The wildly popular YouTube personality and author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;My Drunk Kitchen &lt;/em&gt;is back! This time, she’s stirring up memories and tales from her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By combing through the journals that Hannah has kept for much of her life, this collection of narrative essays delivers a fuller picture of her life, her experiences, and the things she’s figured out about family, faith, love, sexuality, self-worth, friendship and fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revealing what makes Hannah tick, this sometimes cringe-worthy, poignant collection of stories is sure to deliver plenty of Hannah’s wit and wisdom, and hopefully encourage you to try your hand at her patented brand of reckless optimism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, my darlings! I am incredibly pleased to present BUFFERING: Unshared Tales of a Life Fully Loaded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a big fan of memoirs, I wanted to try my hand at writing about the events of my life that deserve a little more consideration than can be accomplished in 140-characters or a 6-minute vlog. Now on the cusp of turning 30, I'm ready to expose some parts of my life that I haven't shared before. Before, it was all about privacy, process and time. And now the time has come! I’m ready to put myself out there, for you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a little nervous about all these vulnerable words going into the world, these tales about my love life, the wrestling I’ve done with faith, how I feel about sex and my family and myself. I’ve had a lot of trials, a lot of errors, but also a lot of passion. Here’s the thing--I've always found comfort in the stories shared by others, so I hope my stories, now that I feel ready to tell them, will bring you some comfort too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you read this book please remember: Buffering is just the time it takes to process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Simon Lewis has been a human and a vampire, and now he is becoming a Shadowhunter. But the events of &lt;i&gt;City of Heavenly Fire&lt;/i&gt; left him stripped of his memories, and Simon isn’t sure who he is anymore. He knows he was friends with Clary, and that he convinced the total goddess Isabelle Lightwood to go out with him…but he doesn’t know how. And when Clary and Isabelle look at him, expecting him to be a man he doesn’t remember…Simon can’t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the Shadowhunter Academy reopens, Simon throws himself into this new world of demon-hunting, determined to find himself again. His new self. Whomever this new Simon might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Academy is a Shadowhunter institution, which means it has some problems. Like the fact that non-Shadowhunter students have to live in the basement. And that differences—like being a former vampire—are greatly looked down upon. At least Simon is trained in weaponry—even if it’s only from hours of playing D&amp;amp;D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Simon on his journey to become a Shadowhunter, and learn about the Academy’s illustrious history along the way, through guest lecturers such as Jace Herondale, Tessa Gray, and Magnus Bane. These ten short stories give an epilogue to the Mortal Instruments series and provide glimpses of what’s in store in the Dark Artifices.</description>

  <description>The only daughter of a prominent samurai, Mariko has always known she’d been raised for one purpose and one purpose only: to marry. Never mind her cunning, which rivals that of her twin brother, Kenshin, or her skills as an accomplished alchemist. Since Mariko was not born a boy, her fate was sealed the moment she drew her first breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at just seventeen years old, Mariko is sent to the imperial palace to meet her betrothed, a man she did not choose, for the very first time. But the journey is cut short when Mariko’s convoy is viciously attacked by the Black Clan, a dangerous group of bandits who’ve been hired to kill Mariko before she reaches the palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lone survivor, Mariko narrowly escapes to the woods, where she plots her revenge. Dressed as a peasant boy, she sets out to infiltrate the Black Clan and hunt down those responsible for the target on her back. Once she’s within their ranks, though, Mariko finds for the first time she’s appreciated for her intellect and abilities. She even finds herself falling in love—a love that will force her to question everything she’s ever known about her family, her purpose, and her deepest desires.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;CONTAINS GRAPHIC ADULT CONTENT, EXTREME GORE, VIOLENCE, ABUSE, AND DARK SUBJECT MATTER.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Dodgson was happier than she had ever been in her life. She and her girlfriend Rose had just moved into a little beach house by the ocean, and she had just started an internship at the Lutwidge Mental Health Institute. She was finally putting her past behind her and looking forward to her future. That is until the nightmares began.&lt;br /&gt;Working alongside Dr. Lewis C. Pelletier, a cigar-loving Psychiatrist, Alice discovered that there was more to him, and the Institute, than she realized. There were secrets around every corner, unusual patients with a strange connection to her past, and a shadowy figure calling out her name.&lt;br /&gt;Will Alice learn the truth before she's too late?&lt;br /&gt;A chilling re-telling of the children's classic, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A modern-day adult horror filled with twists and turns, and psychological thrills.</description>

  <description>Kacey is the new girl in Broken Falls. When she moved in with her father, she stepped into a brand-new life. A life with a stepbrother, a stepmother, and strangest of all, an adoring younger half sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacey’s new life is eerily charming compared with the wild highs and lows of the old one she lived with her volatile mother. And everyone is so nice in Broken Falls—she’s even been welcomed into a tight new circle of friends. Bailey and Jade invite her to do everything with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why it’s so odd when they start acting distant. And when they don’t invite her to the biggest party of the year, it doesn’t exactly feel like an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kacey will never be able to ask, because Bailey never makes it home from that party. Suddenly, Broken Falls doesn’t seem so welcoming after all—especially once everyone starts looking to the new girl for answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacey is about to learn some very important lessons: Sometimes appearances can be deceiving. Sometimes when you’re the new girl, you shouldn’t trust anyone.</description>

  <description>When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://harrypotter.scholastic.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://harrypotter.scholastic.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Their romance shaped a nation. The rest was history.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1777. Albany, New York. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As battle cries of the American Revolution echo in the distance, servants flutter about preparing for one of New York society’s biggest events: the Schuylers’ grand ball. Descended from two of the oldest and most distinguished bloodlines in New York, the Schuylers are proud to be one of their fledgling country’s founding families, and even prouder still of their three daughters—Angelica, with her razor-sharp wit; Peggy, with her dazzling looks; and Eliza, whose beauty and charm rival that of both her sisters, though she’d rather be aiding the colonists’ cause than dressing up for some silly ball. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, she can barely contain her excitement when she hears of the arrival of one Alexander Hamilton, a mysterious, rakish young colonel and General George Washington’s right-hand man. Though Alex has arrived as the bearer of bad news for the Schuylers, he can’t believe his luck—as an orphan, and a bastard one at that—to be in such esteemed company. And when Alex and Eliza meet that fateful night, so begins an epic love story that would forever change the course of American history.</description>

  <description>Ramona was only five years old when Hurricane Katrina changed her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, it’s been Ramona and her family against the world. Standing over six feet tall with unmistakable blue hair, Ramona is sure of three things: she likes girls, she’s fiercely devoted to her family, and she knows she’s destined for something bigger than the trailer she calls home in Eulogy, Mississippi. But juggling multiple jobs, her flaky mom, and her well-meaning but ineffectual dad forces her to be the adult of the family. Now, with her sister, Hattie, pregnant, responsibility weighs more heavily than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The return of her childhood friend Freddie brings a welcome distraction. Ramona’s friendship with the former competitive swimmer picks up exactly where it left off, and soon he’s talked her into joining him for laps at the pool. But as Ramona falls in love with swimming, her feelings for Freddie begin to shift too, which is the last thing she expected. With her growing affection for Freddie making her question her sexual identity, Ramona begins to wonder if perhaps she likes girls and guys or if this new attraction is just a fluke. Either way, Ramona will discover that, for her, life and love are more fluid than they seem.</description>

  <description>Two worlds are poised on the brink of a vicious war. By way of a staggering deception, Karou has taken control of the chimaera's rebellion and is intent on steering its course away from dead-end vengeance. The future rests on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brutal angel emperor brings his army to the human world, Karou and Akiva are finally reunited - not in love, but in a tentative alliance against their common enemy. It is a twisted version of their long-ago dream, and they begin to hope that it might forge a way forward for their people. And, perhaps, for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with even bigger threats on the horizon, are Karou and Akiva strong enough to stand among the gods and monsters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone trilogy comes to a stunning conclusion as - from the streets of Rome to the caves of the Kirin and beyond - humans, chimaera, and seraphim strive, love, and die in an epic theater that transcends good and evil, right and wrong, friend and enemy.</description>

  <description>The world is darker than it seems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demons, vicious half-humans and evil creatures of myth and legend prowl the earth, unseen to human eyes – but not to the eyes of 14-year-old Sage Alexander. Descended from humans and angels, Sage has the power to see and fight all these creatures, and in fact he must. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human race is in danger, controlled unknowingly by the Seven Princes of Hell, the seven deadly sins. Greed, Sloth, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Wrath and Pride all breathe their sin into weaker human ears and take those souls for their own, as they have for centuries. And now Mammon, Greed incarnate, has possessed Sage’s father and threatens to keep him forever. The Angelic Response Council, a committee of angels, archangels, guardians and half-angelic humans, has fought the forces of blackest evil for centuries, but their numbers are dwindling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is prophecy of a gifted warrior, who will come in the Council’s darkest hour to bring about the demise of the fallen angels cast out from heaven and all of their nefarious descendants. His name will be Sage Alexander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage must face danger and death as he assembles a supernatural team and battles his way through time and Godspace in order to save his family from the grips of Greed. But he has an even bigger quest ahead of him. … This is only the beginning.</description>

  <description>There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it’s haunting Harry Pottter’s dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named---a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His fate depends on them all.</description>

  <description>When Julia finds a slur about her best friend scrawled across the back of the Kingston School for the Deaf, she covers it up with a beautiful (albeit illegal) graffiti mural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her supposed best friend snitches, the principal expels her, and her two mothers set Julia up with a one-way ticket to a “mainstream” school in the suburbs, where she’s treated like an outcast as the only deaf student. The last thing she has left is her art, and not even Banksy himself could convince her to give that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out in the ’burbs, Julia paints anywhere she can, eager to claim some turf of her own. But Julia soon learns that she might not be the only vandal in town. Someone is adding to her tags, making them better, showing off—and showing Julia up in the process. She expected her art might get painted over by cops. But she never imagined getting dragged into a full-blown graffiti war.</description>

  <description>Starting at a new school is scary, even more so with a giant hearing aid strapped to your chest! At her old school, everyone in Cece's class was deaf. Here she is different. She is sure the kids are staring at the Phonic Ear, the powerful aid that will help her hear her teacher. Too bad it also seems certain to repel potential friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Cece makes a startling discovery. With the Phonic Ear she can hear her teacher not just in the classroom, but anywhere her teacher is in school — in the hallway... in the teacher's lounge... in the bathroom! This is power. Maybe even superpower! Cece is on her way to becoming El Deafo, Listener for All. But the funny thing about being a superhero is that it's just another way of feeling different... and lonely. Can Cece channel her powers into finding the thing she wants most, a true friend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This funny perceptive graphic novel memoir about growing up hearing impaired is also an unforgettable book about growing up, and all the super and super embarrassing moments along the way.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Maas, the earth will be painted red as mighty armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy them all.</description>

  <description>In 2014, award-winning journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote about her frustration with the way that discussions of race and racism in Britain were being led by those who weren't affected by it. She posted a piece on her blog, entitled: 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' that led to this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring issues from eradicated black history to the political purpose of white dominance, whitewashed feminism to the inextricable link between class and race, Reni Eddo-Lodge offers a timely and essential new framework for how to see, acknowledge and counter racism. It is a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration of what it is to be a person of colour in Britain today.</description>

  <description>Princess Eadlyn has grown up hearing endless stories about how her mother and father met. Twenty years ago, America Singer entered the Selection and won the heart of Prince Maxon—and they lived happily ever after. Eadlyn has always found their fairy-tale story romantic, but she has no interest in trying to repeat it. If it were up to her, she'd put off marriage for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a princess's life is never entirely her own, and Eadlyn can't escape her very own Selection—no matter how fervently she protests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eadlyn doesn't expect her story to end in romance. But as the competition begins, one entry may just capture Eadlyn's heart, showing her all the possibilities that lie in front of her . . . and proving that finding her own happily ever after isn't as impossible as she's always thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—&lt;/b&gt;and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Weep.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>1950s England. Five-year-old Gracie Scott lives with her Mam and next door to her best friend Billy. An only child, she has never known her Da. When her Uncle Joe moves in, his physical abuse of Gracie’s mother starts almost immediately. But when his attentions wander to Gracie, an even more sinister pattern of behaviour begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gracie grows older, she finds solace and liberation in books, poetry and her enduring friendship with Billy. Together they escape into the poetic fairy-tale worlds of their imaginations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will fairy tales be enough to save Gracie from Uncle Joe’s psychopathic behaviour – and how far will it go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seas of Snow is a haunting, psychological domestic drama that probes the nature and the origins of evil.</description>

  <description>Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church hierarchy think she's far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she's no closer to ending the men who destroyed her familia; in fact, she's told directly that Consul Scaeva is off limits. But after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia's suspicions about the Red Church's true motives begin to grow.</description>

  <description>Having long-wondered what lives beyond the ice shelf, nineteen-year-old mermaid Ersel learns of the life she wants when she rescues and befriends Ragna, a shield-maiden stranded on the mermen’s glacier. But when Ersel’s childhood friend and suitor catches them together, he gives Ersel a choice: say goodbye to Ragna or face justice at the hands of the glacier’s brutal king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to forge a different fate, Ersel seeks help from Loki. But such deals are never as one expects, and the outcome sees her exiled from the only home and protection she’s known. To save herself from perishing in the barren, underwater wasteland and be reunited with the human she’s come to love, Ersel must try to outsmart the God of Lies.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley &lt;/i&gt;comes a brand-new novel about a teenage boy who must decide whether or not the world is worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Denton has spent years being periodically abducted by aliens. Then the aliens give him an ultimatum: The world will end in 144 days, and all Henry has to do to stop it is push a big red button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only he isn’t sure he wants to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, life hasn’t been great for Henry. His mom is a struggling waitress held together by a thin layer of cigarette smoke. His brother is a jobless dropout who just knocked someone up. His grandmother is slowly losing herself to Alzheimer’s. And Henry is still dealing with the grief of his boyfriend’s suicide last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiping the slate clean sounds like a pretty good choice to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Henry is a scientist first, and facing the question thoroughly and logically, he begins to look for pros and cons: in the bully who is his perpetual one-night stand, in the best friend who betrayed him, in the brilliant and mysterious boy who walked into the wrong class. Weighing the pain and the joy that surrounds him, Henry is left with the ultimate choice: push the button and save the planet and everyone on it…or let the world—and his pain—be destroyed forever.</description>

  <description>At seventeen, Norah has accepted that the four walls of her house delineate her life. She &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; that fearing everything from inland tsunamis to odd numbers is irrational, but her mind insists the world outside is too big, too dangerous. So she stays safe inside, watching others’ lives through her windows and social media feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Luke arrives on her doorstep, he doesn’t see a girl defined by medical terms and mental health. Instead, he sees a girl who is funny, smart, and brave. And Norah likes what he sees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their friendship turns deeper, but Norah knows Luke deserves a normal girl. One who can walk beneath the open sky. One who is unafraid of kissing. One who isn’t so screwed up. Can she let him go for his own good—or can Norah learn to see herself through Luke’s eyes?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York City.&lt;br /&gt;1927.&lt;br /&gt;Lights are bright.&lt;br /&gt;Jazz is king.&lt;br /&gt;Parties are wild.&lt;br /&gt;And the dead are coming...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After battling a supernatural sleeping sickness that early claimed two of their own, the Diviners have had enough of lies. They're more determined than ever to uncover the mystery behind their extraordinary powers, even as they face off against an all-new terror. Out on Ward's Island, far from the city's bustle, sits a mental hospital haunted by the lost souls of people long forgotten--ghosts who have unusual and dangerous ties to the man in the stovepipe hat, also known as the King of Crows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With terrible accounts of murder and possession flooding in from all over, and New York City on the verge of panic, the Diviners must band together and brave the sinister ghosts invading the asylum, a fight that will bring them fact-to-face with the King of Crows. But as the explosive secrets of the past come to light, loyalties and friendships will be tested, love will hang in the balance, and the Diviners will question all that they've ever known. All the while, malevolent forces gather from every corner in a battle for the very soul of a nation--a fight that could claim the Diviners themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>How do you live your life if your past is based on a lie? A new novel in both verse and prose from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, Ellen Hopkins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, it’s been just Ariel and Dad. Ariel’s mom disappeared when she was a baby. Dad says home is wherever the two of them are, but Ariel is now seventeen and after years of new apartments, new schools, and new faces, all she wants is to put down some roots. Complicating things are Monica and Gabe, both of whom have stirred a different kind of desire.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maya’s a teenager who’s run from an abusive mother right into the arms of an older man she thinks she can trust. But now she’s isolated with a baby on the way, and life’s getting more complicated than Maya ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ariel and Maya’s lives collide unexpectedly when Ariel’s mother shows up out of the blue with wild accusations: Ariel wasn’t abandoned. Her father kidnapped her fourteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What is Ariel supposed to believe? Is it possible Dad’s woven her entire history into a tapestry of lies? How can she choose between the mother she’s been taught to mistrust and the father who has taken care of her all these years?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In bestselling author Ellen Hopkins’s deft hands, Ariel’s emotionally charged journey to find out the truth of who she really is balances beautifully with Maya’s story of loss and redemption. This is a memorable portrait of two young women trying to make sense of their lives and coming face to face with themselves—for both the last and the very first time.</description>

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Pea looks normal, but she has a secret: she has Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). It is like having a monster inside of her, one that not only dictates what she can eat, but also causes anxiety, depression, and thoughts that she doesn’t want to have. When she falls crazy-mad in love with Ben, she hides her disorder from him, pretending that she’s fine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, everything really does feel like it’s getting better with him around, so she stops taking her anxiety and depression medication. And that's when the monster really takes over her life. Just as everything seems lost and hopeless, Pea finds in her family, and in Ben, the support and strength she needs to learn that her eating disorder doesn’t have to control her.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The rock in the water does not know the pain of the rock in the sun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the corner of American Street and Joy Road, Fabiola Toussaint thought she would finally find &lt;i&gt;une belle vie&lt;/i&gt;—a good life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after they leave Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Fabiola’s mother is detained by U.S. immigration, leaving Fabiola to navigate her loud American cousins, Chantal, Donna, and Princess; the grittiness of Detroit’s west side; a new school; and a surprising romance, all on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as she finds her footing in this strange new world, a dangerous proposition presents itself, and Fabiola soon realizes that freedom comes at a cost. Trapped at the crossroads of an impossible choice, will she pay the price for the American dream?</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Aki Simon has a theory. And it's mostly about sex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it isn't that kind of theory. Aki already knows she's bisexual—even if, until now, it's mostly been in the hypothetical sense. Aki has dated only guys so far, and her best friend, Lori, is the only person who knows she likes girls, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, Aki's theory is that she's got only one shot at living an interesting life—and that means she's got to stop sitting around and thinking so much. It's time for her to actually do something. Or at least try. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Aki and Lori set off on a church youth-group trip to a small Mexican town for the summer and Aki meets Christa—slightly older, far more experienced—it seems her theory is prime for the testing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's not going to be easy. For one thing, how exactly do two girls have sex, anyway? And more important, how can you tell if you're in love? It's going to be a summer of testing theories—and the result may just be love.</description>

  <description>Bernice Aurora Wescott has one thing she doesn't want anyone to know: her name. That is, until Bee meets Levi, the local golden boy who runs a charity organization called The Color Project.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Levi is not at all shy about attempting to guess Bee’s real name; his persistence is one of the many reasons why Bee falls for him. But while Levi is everything she never knew she needed, giving up her name would feel like a stamp on forever. And that terrifies her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When unexpected news of an illness in the family drains Bee's summer of everything bright, she is pushed to the breaking point. Losing herself in The Color Project—a world of weddings, funerals, cancer patients, and hopeful families that the charity funds—is no longer enough. Bee must hold up the weight of her family, but to do that, she needs Levi. She’ll have to give up her name and let him in completely or lose the best thing that’s ever happened to her.</description>

  <description>When Griffin's first love and ex-boyfriend, Theo, dies in a drowning accident, his universe implodes. Even though Theo had moved to California for college and started seeing Jackson, Griffin never doubted Theo would come back to him when the time was right. But now, the future he's been imagining for himself has gone far off course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things worse, the only person who truly understands his heartache is Jackson. But no matter how much they open up to each other, Griffin's downward spiral continues. He's losing himself in his obsessive compulsions and destructive choices, and the secrets he's been keeping are tearing him apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Griffin is ever to rebuild his future, he must first confront his history, every last heartbreaking piece in the puzzle of his life.</description>

  <description>Presented by James Patterson's new children's imprint, this deliciously creepy horror novel has a storyline inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this dazzling, #1 New York Times bestselling debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“This whole game is just designed to make us hate ourselves.”—Shay &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Uglies &lt;/i&gt;told Tally Youngblood’s version of life in Uglyville and the budding rebellion against the Specials. Now comes an exciting graphic novel revealing &lt;i&gt;new &lt;/i&gt;adventures in the Uglies world—as seen through the eyes of Shay, Tally’s rebellious best friend who’s not afraid to break the rules, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A few months shy of her sixteenth birthday, Shay eagerly awaits her turn to become a Pretty—a rite-of-passage operation called “the Surge” that transforms ordinary Uglies into paragons of beauty. Yet after befriending the Crims, a group of fellow teens who refuse to take anything in society at face value, Shay starts to question the whole concept. And as the Crims explore beyond the monitored borders of Uglyville into the forbidden, ungoverned wild, Shay must choose between the perks of being Pretty and the rewards of being real.</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>A contemporary YA novel that examines rape culture through alternating perspectives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Craft knows how to kill someone. And she doesn’t feel bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, when her older sister, Anna, was murdered and the killer walked free, Alex uncaged the language she knows best—the language of violence. While her own crime goes unpunished, Alex knows she can’t be trusted among other people. Not with Jack, the star athlete who wants to really know her but still feels guilty over the role he played the night Anna’s body was discovered. And not with Peekay, the preacher’s kid with a defiant streak who befriends Alex while they volunteer at an animal shelter. Not anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their senior year unfolds, Alex’s darker nature breaks out, setting these three teens on a collision course that will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Arrogant. Scornful. Full of pride. Darnuir, Prince of Dragons, cares nothing for the damage he's doing to the faltering alliance against the demonic forces of the Shadow. He thinks himself invincible - right up till a mortal wound forces him to undergo a dangerous rebirthing spell, leaving him a helpless babe in human hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years pass and demonic forces are once again poised to sweep across the land. With the alliance between humanity, dragons, and fairies fracturing, Darnuir will have to uncover the secrets of his past, seek redemption for his sins, and rally the disparate races if they are to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Darnuir can do this. For he’s the last member of the royal bloodline and only he can wield the Dragon’s Blade...</description>

  <description>Part Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, part Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, Adam Silvera's extraordinary debut confronts race, class, and sexuality during one charged near-future summer in the Bronx. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Aaron Soto is struggling to find happiness after a family tragedy leaves him reeling. He's slowly remembering what happiness might feel like this summer with the support of his girlfriend Genevieve, but it's his new best friend, Thomas, who really gets Aaron to open up about his past and confront his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Thomas and Aaron get closer, Aaron discovers things about himself that threaten to shatter his newfound contentment. A revolutionary memory-alteration procedure, courtesy of the Leteo Institute, might be the way to straighten himself out. But what if it means forgetting who he truly is?</description>

  <description>TO HEAR THE OCEAN SIGH is a contemporary-realistic, coming-of-age narrative by satiric novelist Bryant A. Loney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Murchison believes he is a nobody at his high school in Oklahoma. Coming from a conservative family of affordable luxury, Jay has an overwhelming desire to become something great. After a mysterious girl named Saphnie in North Carolina mistakenly texts him, an unlikely relationship develops that affects Jay’s self-perception and influences the rest of his sophomore year. This correspondence leads him to a group of thrill-seekers who provide a grand departure from the quiet life Jay is familiar with and eye-opening experiences to witness first-hand the truth behind the loose morals his fellow classmates have come to know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a story filled with injustice, hope, hatred, love, grief, and understanding, readers will ask themselves what it truly means to hear the ocean sigh and learn of the dire consequences that come with its responsibilities.</description>

  <description>Andie had it all planned out. When you are a politician’s daughter who’s pretty much raised yourself, you learn everything can be planned or spun, or both. Especially your future. Important internship? Check. Amazing friends? Check. Guys? Check (as long as we’re talking no more than three weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was before the scandal. Before having to be in the same house with her dad. Before walking an insane number of dogs. That was before Clark and those few months that might change her whole life. Because here’s the thing—if everything’s planned out, you can never find the unexpected. And where’s the fun in that?</description>

  <description>In this dramatic and compelling narrative, anthropologist Don Kulick follows the lives of a group of transgendered prostitutes (called &lt;i&gt;travestis&lt;/i&gt; in Portuguese) in the Brazilian city Salvador. &lt;i&gt;Travestis&lt;/i&gt; are males who, often beginning at ages as young as ten, adopt female names, clothing styles, hairstyles, and linguistic pronouns. More dramatically, they ingest massive doses of female hormones and inject up to twenty liters of industrial silicone into their bodies to create breasts, wide hips, and large thighs and buttocks. Despite such irreversible physiological changes, virtually no &lt;i&gt;travesti&lt;/i&gt; identifies herself as a woman. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;travestis&lt;/i&gt; regard any male who does so as mentally disturbed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kulick analyzes the various ways &lt;i&gt;travestis&lt;/i&gt; modify their bodies, explores the motivations that lead them to choose this particular gendered identity, and examines the complex relationships that they maintain with one another, their boyfriends, and their families. Kulick also looks at how &lt;i&gt;travestis&lt;/i&gt; earn their living through prostitution and discusses the reasons prostitution, for most &lt;i&gt;travestis,&lt;/i&gt; is a positive and affirmative experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguing that transgenderism never occurs in a "natural" or arbitrary form, Kulick shows how it is created in specific social contexts and assumes specific social forms. Furthermore, Kulick suggests that &lt;i&gt;travestis&lt;/i&gt;—far from deviating from normative gendered expectations—may in fact distill and perfect the messages that give meaning to gender throughout Brazilian society and possibly throughout much of Latin America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Kulick's engaging voice and sharp analysis, this elegantly rendered account is not only a landmark study in its discipline but also a fascinating read for anyone interested in sexuality and gender. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"There is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told," writes Lena Dunham, and it certainly takes guts to share the stories that make up her first book, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt;. These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to "an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw." Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt; establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice.</description>

  <description>The land itself is alive. It sees, it thinks, it speaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the few who can communicate with it, a phenomenal power is granted. They see as the land does, acquire abilities and skills effortlessly, and perceive unimaginable secrets. Yet this connection also consumes them—once they feel it, they would do anything to keep it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Darse returns to his home world with his surrogate son, Brenol, to discover that the boy possesses this special union with the land. The two travel through the strange world on a mission to save a young girl in peril. But will Brenol's newfound power destroy them all instead?</description>

  <description>What if the most terrifying person you know is your ten-year-old sister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Aussie Che Taylor loves his younger sister, Rosa. But he's also certain that she's a psychopath--clinically, threateningly, dangerously. Recently Rosa has been making trouble, hurting things. Che is the only one who knows; he's the only one his sister trusts. Rosa is smart, talented, pretty, and very good at hiding what she is and the manipulation she's capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their parents, whose business takes the family from place to place, brush off the warning signs as Rosa's -acting out.- Now that they have moved again--from Bangkok to New York City--their new hometown provides far too many opportunities for Rosa to play her increasingly complex and disturbing games. Che's always been Rosa's rock, protecting her from the world. Now, the world might need protection from her.</description>

  <description>Hope has a deadly secret… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though mortals think the gods have disappeared . . . Olympus still rules. Demigods have elite hunters who viciously kill monsters. And shadow-demons from the Underworld, the very harbingers of death, are tracking her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When tragedy destroys the only safety she’s ever known, all signs point to Hades’s demons. Or do they? Something doesn’t add up, and Hope needs answers. But now, someone knows she exists . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to hide, Hope pretends to be normal. She’ll do whatever it takes to keep her secret safe— and her heart protected. But when Athan arrives, her world is turned upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gods, demigods, and demons closing in, the question is… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can a monster stay hidden in plain sight? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Hope on her unforgettable journey to discover what it means to live and her daring fight to break Apollo’s curse. *Previously released as Curse of the Sphinx.* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for readers who love the adventure and romance of Cassandra Clare’s The Mortal Instruments and the mythology of Rick Riordan's Trials of Apollo. The Sphinx series is filled with Greek gods, monsters, demigods, action and romance. It challenges teenage concepts of fate, true love, and what defines courage and heroes. This series is perfect for teens or young adults at heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The longing of dreams draws the dead, and this city holds many dreams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a supernatural showdown with a serial killer, Evie O’Neill has outed herself as a Diviner. With her uncanny ability to read people’s secrets, she’s become a media darling, earning the title “America’s Sweetheart Seer.” Everyone’s in love with the city’s newest It Girl…everyone except the other Diviners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piano-playing Henry DuBois and Chinatown resident Ling Chan are two Diviners struggling to keep their powers a secret—for they can walk in dreams. And while Evie is living the high life, victims of a mysterious sleeping sickness are turning up across New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Henry searches for a lost love and Ling strives to succeed in a world that shuns her, a malevolent force infects their dreams. And at the edges of it all lurks a man in a stovepipe hat who has plans that extend farther than anyone can guess…As the sickness spreads, can the Diviners descend into the dreamworld to save the city?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this heart-stopping sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Diviners&lt;/i&gt;, Printz Award-winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Libba Bray takes readers deeper into the mystical underbelly of New York City.</description>

  <description>Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.</description>

  <description>World War II is drawing to a close in East Prussia and thousands of refugees are on a desperate trek toward freedom, many with something to hide. Among them are Joana, Emilia, and Florian, whose paths converge en route to the ship that promises salvation, the &lt;i&gt;Wilhelm Gustloff&lt;/i&gt;. Forced by circumstance to unite, the three find their strength, courage, and trust in each other tested with each step closer to safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems freedom is within their grasp, tragedy strikes. Not country, nor culture, nor status matter as all ten thousand people—adults and children alike—aboard must fight for the same thing: survival.</description>

  <description>"I watched the colored lights and sparkles coming off of Sebastian in the dark water, as the ocean began the process of rebuilding his tail. I longed to join him in the water, to wrap my arms around him and let him carry me under the sea; but I wasn’t ready. For him, the ocean was a home; for me it was death. Without being able to transform, the ocean depths would suffocate me, the pressure collapse my bones and flesh." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her parent's accident, Clara is shipped off to live with a grandfather she never knew, in a town she can't pronounce. In Ireland, she soon discovers that her mother's secret past is filled with tragedy. Trying to track down the truth, she begins going through changes of her own, until she's not sure just who - or what - she is anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets the mysterious Sebastian, who won't leave her alone, and Ethan, who apparently can't stand to be near her. Both of them seem to have supernatural powers, and she's not quite sure whether they want to kill her or kiss her. Just when things are getting interesting, someone attacks her, and she gets a revelation that destroys everything she thought she knew about the world, humanity, and herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Explore the magical coast of Northern Ireland, and an new interpretation of the Tuatha de Danann, the Fomorians, and mermaid mythology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;An innovative paranormal romance with a brand new magical system, and a version of mermaid biology that actually makes sense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is PART ONE of the first book (Shearwater), of the Ocean Depths Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Knowing the outcome doesn't always make a choice easier... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addison Coleman’s life is one big “What if?” As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. It’s the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addie’s parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live with—her father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the “Norms,” or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves it’s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in school—but she never wanted to be a quarterback’s girlfriend. When Addie’s father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, she’s unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality she’s willing to live through... and who she can’t live without.</description>
