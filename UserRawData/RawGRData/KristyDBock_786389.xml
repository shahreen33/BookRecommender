  <description>Rose gives her heart and lifetime of service to the House of York. Born to a peasant herbalist, she is taken to nearby Middleham Castle by the Countess of Warwick, in the same way we might adopt a puppy. Here she serves as poppet and companion to the Earl of Warwick's second daughter, Anne. Here she also meets Duke Richard, Edward IV's youngest brother, who is undergoing knightly training. The children form a long lasting relationship which caries them into adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Roan Rose" illuminates a lively, brutal medieval world. The painful pushes and pulls of a friendship unequal in rank, the balancing of the needs of those whom she serves against the claims of her family are Rose's tragic dilemma.</description>

  <description>Finding a murdered First Nation's girl in Vancouver's Stanley Park, in the middle of tourist season, was the last thing homicide detective Mark Hanson needed, but that's what he's got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark turned for help to the local Friendship Centre, where Metis police liaison Dez Pallaton suggested they ask for help from Spirit Water, a well-known Shaman who held the respect and confidence of the First Nations community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to keep the murder from triggering a race war, Dez convinced Mark to give him time to try and find the killer before revealing evidence that pointed suspicion at the Native community. Although the homicide detective was skeptical, he agreed with Dez that they needed to find this killer before more bodies started turning up in the City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of his co-worker Martine LaChance, Dez set out to uncover the secrets hidden in the murdered girls' past. Both he and Martine believe the killer is a serial; a madman who is leaving clues that point a false trail to a Native as the killer. With the help of Spirit Water, and the aid of forces in both the spirit world and the mundane, they are determined to find the killer before more innocent girls die at his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Previously published as Bad Medicine)</description>

  <description>A mysterious Sanskrit scripture discovered in an ancient Himalayan temple.&lt;br /&gt;Two brothers from the American heartland sharing a close, yet troubled, relationship.&lt;br /&gt;An evil despot determined to conquer the past, present and future.&lt;br /&gt;And a beautiful young woman who tests the brothers’ bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little do Jack and Steve realize that the text is actually a prescription for time-travel. In the midst of a deep conflict, they are transported to different destinations. At time’s beginning, Steve’s heart opens to the beautiful Shanti and learns at last to both love and let go. At the ending age, Jack, sucked into the intrigue and treachery of a civilization unravelling under a dark dictator, is finally forced to become accountable for his actions.&lt;br /&gt;The Yoga Zapper uses themes found in the authentic narratives and prophecies of the Indian subcontinent: yogis meditating for thousands of years, Avatars descending from spiritual realms, magical flying craft known as vimanas, and at the end of time (which is also time’s beginning,) a world-consuming battle between good and evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;This story has it all -- fantasy, adventure, spirituality, and romance. Ashtakala writes with extraordinary attention to the details of the yoga tradition, in a way the reader can easily understand and appreciate. Jack, Steve, and the people they encounter in their journeys are characters that will stay with you for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Julia Marshall, writer | communications change management specialist | yoga teacher. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.jewelyoga.ca" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.jewelyoga.ca&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>In April 1860, Dr. Ryder Cole returns home from his studies, sure of his abilities and on fire to serve his country and preserve the Union. A panther attack threatens to cut his life short until a young woman with a rife and a sure-shot eye appears out of the mist. Then she disappears, re-turning as Tom Boyde, his comrade throughout America’s Civil War, and as Diana, met in a Washington D.C. whore house. The seven Aprils from 1860 to 1866 tell their tale of love and war, sex and friendship. And the price of crossing gender lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editorial Reviews&lt;br /&gt;“Eileen Charbonneau pens an emotion-filled tale. Through her story of love, comradeship and struggle through the Civil War, Seven Aprils illuminates women's hidden role in history by a mas-ter at bringing the past to life. Not to be missed!” –&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Pence, USA Today bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This epic story offers a tale of love and hope, forged and tempered by the fury of the American Civil War. Seven Aprils is certain to enthrall readers."&lt;br /&gt;—Jenna Kernan Publishers Weekly Bestselling author of Winter Woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Eileen Charbonneau's latest novel, Seven Aprils, moves with the subtle sweep of her best fiction and confirms her place in the literary tradition of Willa Cather.” -- Robert Crooke, author of American Family and The Chastened Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Seven Aprils is full of rollicking adventure, steamy romance, great historical content, and even a little espionage. A true page turner, Seven Aprils keeps the reader riveted to the very end.” Eileen O'Finlan, Author of Kelegeen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Eileen Charbonneau has written a beautiful story of friendship becoming love against the background of the Civil War. The writing is both lush and terse and is a brilliant story. I didn't want Seven Aprils to end.” —Janet Lane Walters, author of The Amber Chronicles</description>

  <description>By 1840 the colony of New South Wales was expanding. Transportation of convicts to the east coast ended, and many free squatters set out to settle on lands to the south. In 1836, the Government in London authorised Governor Bourke to establish a settlement in The Port Philip District of New South Wales, and an Association was formed to make the district a separate colony. Timothy, Tiger and Bella Carstairs eldest son has turned 21. Bored with his Government job and intent on seeking adventure and a new life away from Sydney, Tim decides to journey south in an endeavour to find this adventure, accompanied by his Uncle Carlos. Where else to find it, but in a newly formed settlement. In the 1840s the road south might not be as hazardous as the one across the mountains travelled by his parents when he was a child, but the month long journey overland holds many dangers and challenges to be faced. Escaped and ex-convicts seek the easy life by forming gangs to take what they can where they can. Forced to fight off the intruders who take claim to the land they have cared for over many, many generations, the Indigenous people are faced with many trials and battles of their own. Not the least of Tim's personal challenges is a young headstrong woman who, uninvited, takes it upon herself to join him on his travels. When they reach their destination, their troubles have only just begun.</description>

  <description>In the early 1800s the penal colony of Botany Bay was an unforgiving and harsh place. Isabella O'Shea is transported to New South Wales for wounding a member of the British aristocracy who raped her, so it is understandable that she loathes members of the upper class and the system that punished her; sentenced her to seven years transportation.&lt;br /&gt;Tiger Carstairs is rich, ambitious and English-so is it any wonder she is determined to hate her new master. Tiger dreams of making a new life beyond the aptly named Blue Mountains, so called because of the perpetual haze of blue surrounding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic Mountains is a story of courage and persistence-traits that were essential for the settlers who carved out a new life in a raw land where suffering and heartbreak were commonplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabella and Tiger face tragedy and many hardships in their quest for a new life in this untamed land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tricia McGill has written a sweeping love story of two people fighting for their places in an unfair world among the wild, untamed vistas of Australia. The strong plot reveals much about the early settlement days of the continent of Australia and is a history lesson in itself besides a sizzling romance. A job well done by Ms. McGill.” Lani Roberts 5 stars ***** Affaire de Coeur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes we in America forget that Australia is an equally young country, complete with tales of adventure about the settlement of the land. In this story of love adventure and hardship, we see a man and a woman work together to survive and overcome the harsh land that is Australia. A thoroughly enjoyable book, well-written and exciting.”&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Brent for Romantic Times book club **** four stars</description>

  <description>Chantley Armstrong, a white woman raised in an ashram in India, and Sam Johnson, a proud young black man, come across each other in Boulder, Colorado. The intense feelings aroused by the chance encounter suggest that they share a relationship from previous lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chantley sees the world through the eyes of karma. “Everyone acts according to their karma,” she says, “maybe even entire nations.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply concerned with American injustice, racism and militarism, he asks, “What can you say about a country that starts its history with a slavery and a genocide? What kind of karma is that?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once sheltered but now on her own, Chantley struggles to adapt and gain courage, while Sam, deeply intellectual, strives to find his center.&lt;br /&gt;Discovering that they may have been lovers at a plantation in South Carolina during the antebellum period, they journey through the South, visiting places and people connected to America’s troubled past and uncertain present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they fall deeper in love, their travel exposes conflicts whose origins neither is able to explain. They locate their plantation near Charleston, South Carolina, but its exploration reveals a shocking truth about the real nature of their relationship—one that makes them question who they are, their deep-seated beliefs and the meaning of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1905 London&lt;/b&gt; is a heady mix of unimaginable wealth and simmering political tensions, and with war looming &lt;b&gt;Flora Maguire&lt;/b&gt; wants to keep her family safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when her beloved charge Viscount Edward Trent is accused of murder, she's determined not to leave the investigation to the police. Flora has trodden the path of amateur sleuth before, but with so much at stake, this time it's personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly the body of the victim found stabbed on a train bound for Paddington starts giving up its secrets, and Flora and her husband Bunny become mired in a murky world of spies, communists and fraudsters. And with the police more sure than ever that Edward is their murderer, Flora must work fast to keep him safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anita Davison's compulsive story-telling, combined with the irresistible mix of historical drama and gripping mystery, make this unputdownable. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Venice the city famous for love and intrigue where masquerade hides a face or a background of secrets . . . Chiara Mackenzie Davis and her stepbrother Chas Weston must discover why Francesca Severino, Chiara's 84 year-old grandmother, travels alone to Venice without telling anyone. The situation becomes more complicated when Chiara meets family she didn't know existed. The Cavaliere Orlando Paladino and his son Father Girardo have their own questions about Francesca's visit. Can Chiara and Chas find the answers they all seek and discover what hides behind the mask each of them wears to find their way to love?Diane Carrero served in the war zones of the Middle East as a member of the Army’s Human Terrain System. Images of death and destruction haunt her and she flees to Venice. She believes a sign from God will give her a new direction. At dinner with the Paladino family, she meets the handsome, reserved, and mysterious Luca Savarese. After a golden eagle appears on her hotel balcony, Diane believes she has received her sign and she returns to Virginia. Six months later, Luca pays her a surprise visit, but who is Luca, and what role does he play in her life?Alessandro Falconieri, renowned soundtrack composer and international playboy, yearns for the settled life of a country gentleman. He gets his wish when he acquires the Venetian villa from his cousin, Girardo Paladino. During renovations, the contractor uncovers a sealed room—one that has kept its secrets for generations. Alessandro calls his cousin now elevated to the rank of Monsignor. Girardo engages sociologist, Siena Jordan, to lend her expertise. Siena's crystal blue eyes hint at secrets, but her face is a mask of calm serenity—one that cloaks her pain. After she dreams of the Goddess, she discovers the key that unravels the puzzle and the portal to another realm. Is that realm one where two people with diverse backgrounds can find a world made new?</description>

  <description>Tamara Ledbetter, dumped by her arrogant husband, travels to Cornwall, England, to research her ancestors. A trip first planned with her soon-to-be ex. While in a neglected cemetery, she scrapes two fallen headstones together to read what's beneath, faints, and awakes in 1789. Certain she's caught in a reenactment, she fast discovers she's in the year of the French Revolution, grain riots in England, miners out of work, and she's mistrusted by the young farmer, Colum Polwhele, who's come to her aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a sassy San Francisco gal survive in this primitive time where women have few rights? Could she fall for Colum, a man active in underhanded dealings that involve stolen grain, or will she struggle to return to her own time before danger stalks them both?</description>

  <description>Previously A Double Opposition: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her mother was a hired nanny and her father the Mellwood Bank. This is the way Taurus Laurel Richmond describes her family. After burning out as a nurse with an international health agency, she returns to Eastlake, the one place she where she felt connected. She studied nursing here and made a number of friends. Her one problem is her wealth. Soon she will receive a fortune. But money hasn’t given her the things she wants, a home, a family and love. Since a chance visit after summer camp with a friend made there, her idea of a man to love has been Alex Carter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Carter is a Scorpio, a single dad with a five year old son. He’s a general practitioner at Eastlake Community Hospital. While attracted to Laurel, he has one problem. His ex and now dead wife had a lot of money and little sense. Drugs and her fast friends were her life. She abandoned their son who cried for hours until his father returned. Alex has no love for women with money. Attraction or not he refuses to admit he’s falling for Laurel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the help of Alex’s son, Laurel sets out to prove to Alex she’s in town for the long haul and she will make the perfect wife and mother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Review: &lt;br /&gt;Janet Lane Walters has written a charming tale. &lt;br /&gt;As a child, Laurel Richmond was trapped in a car with her dead parents for hours. After losing them, Laurel's next of kin was a bank. Laurel hides her immense wealth, traveling internationally as a nurse, helping the sick. She decides to settle in Eastlake, a small community. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She once summered with her friend Megan, developing a huge crush on Megan's brother, Alex, who is now a divorced doctor raising his young son Johnny. Alex is leary of wealth because his rich ex-wife had no time for him or Johnny, but Johnny takes to Laurel right away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The glimpses of a family life that Laurel experiences with Johnny and Alex leave her longing for her dreams to become reality. Can she get Alex to realize that money may bring power, but love offers peace? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Born under a dark moon, Norna has to battle rumors that she is tainted by evil and unworthy of being anything more than a servant. Discarded by her mother, she runs away from her aunt, a priestess who wants her to enter the temple. &lt;br /&gt;Instead, Norna chooses to be a Healwoman, and a chance encounter with a novice hoping to be a priest helps her discover she has talents of water, air and fire at her disposal. With these gifts she is called on to battle treachery and attempts to prevent the promised prophecy of the god and goddess. As she battles evil powers, she loses her heart to Shandor, the man she met when her journey first began. She must come to grips with Britha who plots against her. Shandor has his own enemy Vorgan. When the pair of foes unite, the battles begin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Previously published as Dark Moon Healwoman</description>

  <description>In 1796, Lady Melwyn Pencavel has been betrothed to Griffin Lambrick since she was a child—and she hasn’t seen him since. Now almost one and twenty, she defies being forced into an arranged marriage. She aspires to be an archeologist and travel to Italy during the upheaval of the Napoleonic Wars. Griffin Lambrick, Viscount of Merther, resents these forced nuptials as well, as he desires no simpering bride and wants no one in his business. For the thrill of it, he smuggles artifacts from Italy at his Cornish estate. Two reckless and stubborn people will meet—with chaos and humor—in this romantic satire, and face their fears.</description>

  <description>An urgent call brings Rachel Falconer, naturalist and TV presenter, from her Yorkshire home to manage Kestrel House, her father Paul-s botanical research institute on Dartmoor. There she meets Michael, her old rival at grammar school and now a respected archaeologist; the hostile Daniel, once her colleague and lover; the truculent forester, Colin; and Leo, computer wizard and Don Juan. As Rachel puts Kestrel House back on its feet, and she and Michael begin a new, adult, loving relationship, her past returns to haunt her. One phone call, made several years before in Brazil, has set off a devastating chain of events. On Dartmoor an unknown enemy is closing in - someone who knows her secrets, a bitter adversary skilled in deceit and armed with an intimate knowledge of fire.</description>

  <description>It is 850AD and Norse warrior Rolf lands on the shores of East Anglia determined to take revenge on a Celtic clan. Following a fierce battle, where the Celts are savagely killed, Rolf comes face to face with the daughter of the slain Celtic leader. So stunned by the beauty, along with the courage of Brigid, he is convinced that his Three Fates of Destiny brought them together. Resolved to make this woman his own, he spares the lives of the captured Celtic women and children and takes them back to his homeland across the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely drawn to the Norseman who is so sure they are destined to be together, Brigid must fight against succumbing to the wishes of the man who killed her father. Nevertheless, to save her fellow Celtic captives from slavery or worse, Brigid must keep a bargain with the Norse leader—a bargain that will see her tied to him forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In present day Cornwall, naturally shy Rolf shares his secluded lighthouse with his wolfhound. An artist, he delights in the rugged scenery and ever-changing weather. While in the nearest bookshop one day, he meets a newcomer to town. Brigid’s unusual personality strikes a chord with him. Not only are both convinced they have met before, but their fascination for Viking and Celtic history forges an unusual bond between them. Outspoken and forthright, Brigid sets out to break down the barrier of reserve and caution Rolf has erected over the years. Is it simply whimsy or can lovers across centuries be reunited?</description>

  <description>Grace MacKinnon’s widowhood promises little but a life of drudgery under her father-in-law’s &lt;br /&gt;oppressive rule. When quiet rebellion turns to opportunity, she books passage on an Atlantic &lt;br /&gt;steamer only to face near disaster in Halifax harbour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her future looks doomed from the start until with the help of a sympathetic stranger, and a chance meeting with Lucy Maud Montgomery, she changes destination and arrives on Prince Edward Island. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her new found independence drives her to undertake a brave new adventure in a male &lt;br /&gt;dominated world, and a chance encounter with Lucy Maud Montgomery brings her a &lt;br /&gt;surprising ally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the challenges, Grace keeps her head and prevails, until an encounter with bootleggers &lt;br /&gt;during Canadian Prohibition threatens to topple her hard won success. &lt;br /&gt;Can Grace trust those she goes to for help, or as a woman alone in turn of the century &lt;br /&gt;Charlottetown are the odds stacked against her? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Returning to her Moscow apartment one bitterly cold day in 1937, Natalie Fisher finds the place trashed and her family gone. Like so many in Stalin’s Russia they have been arrested and probably killed. She has fallen in love with her second cousin Stephan, a talented violinist. She has just discovered she is pregnant and in despair goes to the British Embassy for help. There she meets diplomat, Lawrence Sinclair, who proposes marriage as the only way to get safely back to England. She accepts, convinced that Stephan is dead and worried for the future of her baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in England she tries to be a good wife to the much older and rather old-fashioned Lawrence and mother to daughter Stephanie. But after being injured when they are trapped in a bombed house, Lawrence discovers that he is not Stephanie’s father and he and Natalie become estranged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, Natalie finds consolation in her garden, her daughter and her piano, often playing an old Russian folk song - her ‘song of memories’. Stephanie inherits Stephan’s gift for music and dreams of being a concert pianist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Stephan has survived incarceration in the Siberian gulag, escaping to America. After the war, he returns to England and, unable to continue his career as a violinist due to his sufferings in Siberia, he becomes a music teacher and composer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each holds on to the dream that the other has survived and that one day they will be reunited.</description>

  <description>In the process of renovating her Queen Anne style Victorian home, author Anna Hughes decides to convert part of the attic into a quiet place to write. After seeing a stained glass window on the outside of the house that doesn’t show in the attic, it’s only natural she’d insist on knocking down a wall. Once the wall is down she discovers a room complete with furniture, a trunk full of treasures, and shadows hovering over it.</description>

  <description>You can't walk away when it's real. &lt;br /&gt;The death of Captain Jack Ryder’s father, the Duke of Stamford, leaves Jack restless. The Duchess’ spiteful relatives have made his life a misery, and he wants nothing more than to escape London for a time. Dressed in buckskin breeches, he takes to the road on his horse, Arion, with the intention of visiting his mother’s grave in Ireland. But after one day, events conspire to interrupt his plans. &lt;br /&gt;Jack finds himself not only caught up in a conspiracy of immense proportions, but also in a passionate love affair with a lady he cannot marry. Lady Ashley Lambourne’s father, the Marquess of Butterstone has been murdered, and Jack promises to find his killer. &lt;br /&gt;A close friend of Jack’s from his army days, Harry Feather, heir to one of the largest fortunes in England, faces an arranged marriage to Lady Erina Roundtree. A tall half-Irish beauty, Erina is a spirited lady, who makes it plain she doesn’t wish to marry Harry, either. Determined to enjoy a quiet existence after his years fighting Bonaparte, Harry fears Erina will run him ragged. Why he is indulging Erina in one of her harebrained schemes is beyond him, when he should marry a quiet woman like Florence Beckworth. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The wagon carrying Odessa Clay and her father overturns, killing him. Alone and scared in the middle of the desert, she faces finding her way to Phoenix and her Aunt Susan. Food and water run out, and Odessa is near death when Zach Johnson finds her. Squinting up into his tanned and handsome face, Dessie believes she’s died and gone to heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would-be-outlaw, Zach Johnson finds an unconscious woman alone in the middle of nowhere. Where did she come from? First glance: she appears young, but the curves beneath the dusty gingham say otherwise. He didn’t plan to become someone’s hero, but how can he leave her stranded? He’s on his way to join a gang of bank robbers and he has no time to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the promise of Odessa’s sweet lips lure Zach from the secret mission that has his gut twisted into a knot? His father’s ranch isn’t the only thing at stake—now it’s his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I think Ginger Simpson lived in the Wild West in another life. She captures the era so well you can smell and taste it in this story of a young woman lost in the arid desert…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are as realistic as the setting she describes. Both the hero and heroine are loveable, faulted, and feisty. The prose is free and easy, allowing the reader to fall into the story without struggle."</description>

  <description>Luke Kayenta and his childhood friend Nantai Riggs are young shepherds of the Navajo reservation in Arizona. They volunteer for an experiment: to come up with an uncrackable code based on their language to be used by the US as it enters World War II. They fly into New York to join the spy agency the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). While on the airfield, Luke catches sight of a young woman. He is first enchanted, then heartsick when he finds that Kitty Charante is the devoted wife of his Canadian RAF pilot and instructor in espionage. Their paths will cross again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the mountains between Spain and Nazi-occupied France, Luke and Nantai practice the code between radio stations while helping on Allied missions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But off the coast, German SS agent Helmut Adler is celebrating his latest U-Boat conquest when he hears something crackling over the radio lines. When a young soldier of World War I, an American Indian language helped bring down his regiment in the Battle of Meuse-Argonne. Adler swears it will not happen again in this war. He sets his sights on the code talkers. &lt;br /&gt;The hunt has begun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Editorial Reviews &lt;br /&gt;“…a compelling tale of clashing cultures, religions, and classes…” -–Library Journal &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The strength of this novel is in its vivid characterizations." &lt;br /&gt;—Washington Post Book Word &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“The reader will be fascinated by the tale of love and sacrifice, but will also be learning a wealth of history…” —The Literary Times &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1784, Englishwoman Amelia Latimer sails to the new colony of New Brunswick in faraway Canada. She’s to marry a man chosen by her soldier father. Amelia is repulsed by her betrothed, refuses to marry, then meets the handsome Acadian trader, Gilbert, a man beneath her in status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilbert must protect his mother who was attacked by an English soldier. He fights to hold on to their property, to keep it from the Loyalists who have flooded the colony, desperate men chased from the south after the American Revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a land fraught with hardship, Amelia and Gilbert struggle to overcome prejudice and political upheaval, while forging a life in a remote country where events seek to destroy their love and lives.</description>

  <description>Yaotl and Sascho splashed along the shores of the behchà, spears hefted, watching for the flash of fin to rise to the surface and sparkle in the sunlight. Tender feelings, barely discovered, flushed their faces. Waving their spears they laughed and teased one another with sprays of newly melted ice water.&lt;br /&gt;In the distance, the warning about the kw'ahtıı sounds, but on this fatal day it goes unheard; Yaotl and Sascho fall into the hands of the Indian Agents. Transport to Fort Providence residential school is only the beginning of their ordeal, for the teachers believe it is their sworn duty to “kill the Indian inside.”&lt;br /&gt;All attempts at escape are severely punished, but Yaotl and Sascho, along with two others, will try, beginning a journey of 900 Kilometers along the Mackenzie River. Like wild geese, brave hearts together, they are homeward bound.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the biggest risk we take is with our hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1821 London&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-four, Lady Helen Kinsey has her future carefully mapped out. A life of gentle quietude in the country caring for her unmarried brothers and walking with her dog. It does not include marriage, a dream she banished after her first Season. But when a handsome earl enters Kinsey House in London on a mission to find out why their footman was poisoned, she finds herself drawn into solving the mystery. And despite resistance on her part worthy of an army maneuver, she is irresistibly drawn to the earl himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Whitehall receives a letter warning of a plot against the Crown, Jason, Captain Lord Peyton, is sent to investigate. Surely the famous explorer, Lord Lawrence Kinsey could not be behind it. He is engrossed in roaming ancient libraries and tombs in the East and bringing back their treasures for the museum. But after Peyton finds a fragment of a burned letter it appears that something dangerous lurks in Kinsey House, and Peyton becomes determined to keep the defenseless family safe, and one member particularly. Lady Helen has built a wall around herself and holds him at arm’s length. But arm’s length is not where Peyton wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mystery unfolds it becomes imperative for Peyton and Lady Helen to work together, very closely indeed.</description>

  <description>Elsie Nuefeld loves to sit on her porch and watch the children grow in the Mennonite community near Landmark, MB. Returning to the area after moving to Paraguay for a time, Elsie is happy to be living on the wild rose dotted prairie of south-eastern Manitoba. Her granddaughters are growing up and getting married, it's an exciting time. Secure in her long standing marriage to Ike, Elsie is content to observe the community from the sidelines and rejoice in the joys of the young ones. She often walks with her daughters and granddaughters through the graveyard abloom with wild roses and shares the stories of the ancestors sleeping there. It’s important, she feels, for the younger generation to feel connected to those who went before. Elsie hopes when she joins those resting beneath the Landmark roses the tradition of honouring the memory of the forebearers continues.</description>

  <description>The Domenico siblings are in crisis. Guiliana, the fiery-tempered older sister, disheartened by a bad marriage and now unemployed. Can Michael, the dignified warrior and commander, assist her without jeopardizing his human heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marco, the quintessential soldier, injured when a mission goes wrong, now physically challenged his career in ruins. Will Raphael, the healer for whom the traditions and culture of the American old west hold a deep fascination, uncover the key to his healing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecelia, the devoted wife and mother, widowed suddenly and left to raise two young daughters on her own. Gabriel, patron of mothers whose gentle nature masks a fierce and steely resolve, will lend a hand and the much-needed shoulder, but is it enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucifer, created the most beautiful of all the Archangels, hiding in plain sight and still coveting what he can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An engaging set of tales by award winning, multi published author, Robbi Perna, available for the first time in one volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editorial Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Robbi Perna has a family of characters as rich in history and romance as an classical novelist. Hopefully this author will expand her stories to longer novels. She has the talent for it. Romance readers will love this series.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Great book and a fast read… has characters that everyone can relate to, and readers will be swept up in the tensions and conflicts of the characters. This book will bring a tear to your eye, and leave you with a sense of peace and hope.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Great book, an easy quick read. The characters had well defined personalities which drew you into the story. It was interesting how the archangels played a part in the character's lives. It will be interesting to see how the other books in this series complement each other.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I enjoyed this book so much, could not put it down.”</description>

  <description>French-Canadian soldier, Napoleon, proposes to Lea during WWI, promising golden fields of wheat as far as the eye can see. After the armistice, he sends money for her passage, and she journeys far from her family and the conveniences of a modern country to join him on a homestead in Saskatchewan. There, she works hard to build their dream of a prospering farm, clearing fields alongside her husband through several pregnancies and even after suffering a terrible loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the stock market crashes in ’29, the prairies are stricken by a long and abysmal drought. Thrown into poverty, she struggles to survive in a world where work is scarce, death is abundant, and hope dwindles. Will she and her family survive the Great Depression?</description>

  <description>Faced with financial ruin and the loss of her good name, Rose Chadwick decides to make a new start for herself and her young daughter Hannah in the rough and tumble gold rush town of Barkerville, British Columbia. However, making a new life is not so easy when it’s built on lies. And, long suppressed emotions within her are stirred when she meets a handsome young Englishman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viscount Harrison St. John knows he’s expected to marry well to bolster his family fortunes. Instead, he leaves England to pursue riches in the gold fields of a frontier town in the far off wilds of Canada. Soured on love because of a betrayal by his former fiancé, Harrison resists the attraction he has for Rose. Particularly considering she appears to be a happily married woman with a daughter of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will dark secrets from Rose’s past keep them apart? Or will they find love, happiness and a new life together in the bustling town of Barkerville?</description>

  <description>David and Sara Kirke live in a time of upheaval under the reign of King Charles I who gives, then takes. He gives David the nod of approval to range up and down the French Canadian shores, burning colonies and pillaging ships that are loaded with goods meant for the French. When Louis XIII of France shouts his outrage, King Charles reneges. He takes David’s prizes and returns them to the French, putting David and his family in dire straits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undeterred, David and Sara will not be denied. After years, the king relents. He knights David and gives him a grant for the whole of Newfoundland and Labrador. There David and Sara build a prosperous plantation. They trade fish and fish oil with colonies down the American coast, Barbados and ports of call in the Mediterranean. They thrive while England is torn in two by the civil wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, these troubles engulf his family. David is carried in chains back to England to stand trial for being a malignant, a follower of Laud's high church. He entreats Sara to manage the Ferryland plantation, a daunting task but with a strength that defies a stalwart man, she digs in and prospers, becoming the first entrepreneur of Newfoundland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review&lt;br /&gt;by Eileen Charbonneau&lt;br /&gt;Pillars of Avalon is a creative retelling of Newfoundland’s first First Couple: Lord David Kirke and his Lady Sara. Their story traverses the turbulent times in both the Old and New Worlds, from 1628-1675. Although their marriage is a joining of estates, it proves to be a love match as the blustery-hot-headed wine merchant turned Lord governor teams with his clever and resourceful “Twig.” The Kirkes go in and out of favor with Charles I and remain Anglican Royalists during the English civil war. But their hearts and destinies are in the Avalon peninsula of Newfoundland. Details of life in the 17th century abound, from a rollicking wedding night to dress, drink and child-rearing traditions, to the icebergs of the North Atlantic. Wonderful characterizations and exciting action makes this historical fiction in the tradition of Thomas B. Costain.</description>

The death of Nathaniel’s first wife has never been solved, and some of the villagers believe him responsible. Struggling to understand the distant man she married, Laura tries to uncover the truth.

  <description>1907 or Cold Gold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gold mining town in northern California is hardly the place for a member of the English aristocracy. When Lady Serena Buxton arrives in Cold Creek, she is shocked to find her husband, Lord Buxton, is missing. Everyone in town treats her as if she is already a widow. With no husband and no money, what is a lady to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1913 or On Borrowed Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord and Lady Buxton’s orderly lives are upset by Pinkerton Agent Stuart Montgomery’s unexpected arrival at their estate in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montgomery is investigating suspicious deaths at an American aviation company. Will the Buxtons return with him to America and help him close the case? Or is this an excuse for Montgomery to renew a potentially scandalous association with Serena?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1918 or Shell Shocked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Randolph Buxton is fighting at the front during the closing months of World War 1. Lady Serena manages Buxton Hall which has been converted into a military hospital. When Randolph is reported missing in action, Serena is heartbroken but carries on with day-to-day duties while she awaits news of her husband. And then Randolph comes home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She married for love, but she does not know the man who returns to her. Will she be strong enough to hold together everything she most cherishes?</description>

  <description>SIR BALDWIN AND THE CHRISTMAS GHOSTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Baldwin heed Sofia or will the restless dead prevail? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambitious and arrogant, the young knight Sir Baldwin returns to his family’s lands and estate at Brigthorpe to face disaster. The pestilence has struck, destroying his parents and all his family save for a young half-brother, Martin, whom Baldwin does not wish to acknowledge because Martin is the bastard child of a serf. Baldwin needs to learn kindness and how to be a lord–and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this hopeless situation comes Sofia, a young woman who can see glimpses of spirits, of the restless dead. These revenants are very restless around Sir Baldwin.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, Baldwin and Sofia must work together, to make a true Christmas for the survivors of Brigthorpe and the Christmas ghosts. Can they do so in time—or will the gulf of class and custom make any love between them impossible?</description>

  <description>Sarah Pendleton, a first grade teacher in Portland, Oregon, feels duty-bound as she returns to her hometown of Mistletoe Valley--and to her conflicted past. While growing up in her small, rural community Sarah lived with her grandparents, who served their community well--especially her grandfather, a pastor. Yet Sarah despised being the “perfect preacher’s kid” in a small town where everyone knew everyone else’s business. Rebellious, she fell for a stereotypical “bad boy” during high school and after graduation, they married. When they learned she was pregnant, he left her for parts unknown. Unable to support the baby, Sarah gave her up for adoption, yet ever since, guilt has consumed her. She believes she doesn’t deserve to have a second chance at being a mother again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a decade later, she is the sole inheritor of her grandparents’ estate. She must decide whether to sell the property, or make the painful choice of staying in a town where folks remember her rebellious past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She meets the strikingly handsome real estate agent Rich Stevens. He also works as a youth pastor at the church where her grandfather had served. Her attraction to Rich is immediate and powerful, but she’s faced with not one, but two prickly thorns: He is a grieving widower, and his 8-year-old daughter, Carly, is grieving too. He believes that there can never be another woman in his life, and he can succeed in raising his daughter alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah grapples with her own push-pull feelings for Rich. Should she hire him to sell her grandparents’ property, knowing full well he’s more than just a business acquaintance to her? Should she stay in Mistletoe Valley, or go back to her job in Portland? The truth is, if she were to fall in love with him, a man of the collar, she’d be right back to where she started as a child—struggling in vain to live up to others’ expectations. Worse, Rich’s daughter, Carly, is the embodiment of the baby she left behind, and if Sarah allows herself to get too close to Carly, that would only complicate her feelings for Rich. &lt;br /&gt;Can Sarah and Rich overcome their personal demons and making a lasting commitment to each other? Can the two of them—plus Carly--become a forever family?</description>

  <description>Joanna Sansone returns home following her civilian deployment in Iraq as a political advisor. A disfigured left forearm and the loss of her fiance, Renzo Moretti, are the scars she carries from the experience. Now, she asks for nothing more than the peace of her new home, Quintessence, but the U.S. government has other ideas. A large defense contractor calls on her services. A new English language training facility in northern Virginia's horse country needs a registrar. Then, one of the students, the son of an important tribal sheikh, becomes seriously ill. Mick Riliuni is a brilliant physician renowned for his work in tropical diseases and the student's family engages to consult on the case. When he meets Joanna, he accuses her of prejudice when she questions the need for the expertise of the student's mysterious uncle. The arrogant Doctor al-Najid is a painful reminder of her losses and an irritating presence in her life. Caught in the crossfire between two strong personalities, Joanna's passions reawaken, but she has questions. A trip to a mountain fortress in Sicily may yield the answers. Will they give her a future or will her heart remain buried in the grave with Renzo?"</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; Life on a pioneer farm was tough so neighbors helped each other. George Richardson the underage Doctor Barnardo Boy, orphaned and shipped to Canada a few years earlier, is loaned to the Baldwins to help bring in the hay. Younger brother Peter Richardson was placed with another neighbor, so the brothers stayed in touch with each other. The Great War brought a lot of changes to life even in the back woods of Ontario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In spite of the differences in their social standing, George and Annie fell in love. When George departed for France they had an understanding and he promised to return to her when the war was over. Like so many others, Annie waited and hoped, carrying on as best she could. Only time would tell if her dreams would come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In celebration of Canada's 150th Birthday, Books We Love, with the support of the Government of Canada, is publishing a series of novels set in each of the Canadian Provinces and Territories. Each book features a historical event or location as well as the story of a bride and groom, representative of the men and women who came to Canada in search of a new life and new freedoms. These books combine fact and fiction to show how these brides and grooms, all from diverse backgrounds, joined in marriage to create new lives and build a great country.</description>

  <description>Set in a Cathedral city in the 1870s, a remote town dominated by the great cathedral and its formidable Dean Adam Ayscough, who holds a deep love for his parishioners and townspeople. But the craggy, homely old Dean, lived locked in by shyness... when an obscure watchmaker, the timid, fearful little Isaac Peabody, a genius of a clockmaker, strikes up an unlikely friendship with the Dean. It leads to an unusual spiritual awakening in both men, and this unexpected friendship of these two men; also leads the Dean's remarkable awakening to the healing force of unselfish love; and the miracles wrought as he reached out to other human hearts to console them. It eventually reaches out to the entire community. And in the background there are Polly and her beloved Job, Bella and old Mrs Montague.</description>

  <description>Christ Church, Oxford is the location of this tale of the Leigh family, set in the days of Queen Elizabeth I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faithful Crocker, an impoverished young Londoner, heads for Oxford. He's bright, cheeky and good-looking, has a tremendous love of learning and hopes to be an Oxford scholar. When he is taken in by Canon Leigh and his eccentric family, Faithful obtained a home. As Faithful begins to fulfil his academic dream, the Leigh family navigate the tricky waters of first love, uncover shocking secrets and experience devastating loss. The poor young scholar finds the gold at the end of the rainbow... a faithful gatekeeper prevents a lovers' misunderstanding... a young man, with grief and remorse in his heart, finds a child at the inn and brings hint to his rightful home... and a lovely young Queen visits her adoring subjects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charming tale of hope and love, set amid the dreaming spires of Elizabethan Oxford. Radiant with life and lighted by love's enchantment. The towers of Oxford shine through the mist, blessing an ancient city, as the magic of Midsummer Eve brings two lovers under its moonlit spell. In this coming-of-age tale, the excitement, squalor and beauty of the English Renaissance unfolds through the lives of two girls growing up, Oxford students approaching the threshold of distinguished careers, and their elders navigating the complicated waters of sixteenth-century England.</description>

  <description>Who was Gabriel Ferranti? Why had he disappeared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jocelyn Irvin has just returned from the Boer War with an incurably lamed leg. He heads for the cathedral town or Torminster, where he recovers his love of life in the invigorating company of his cousin, Hugh Anthony, his grandfather, the Canon and Henrietta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jocelyn moved into the little house where Ferranti once had lived, a dark Byronic spirit haunted its rooms. Was Ferranti alive or dead? Until they knew, Jocelyn and Felicity must reach out to him. Until Ferranti no longer needed them, they must yield slowly to the madness of love. So the ghost of Gabriel Ferranti guided their lives in surprising ways, and more than one bewildered heart was restored to the wonder and magic of living.</description>

  <description>From the blurb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clyde Batchelor finally married the lovely and aristocratic Lucy Page, it was after overcoming many obstacles and it brought about a great change in him: he turned from his lawless gambling days and, with his wife, built up a fleet of steamboats unmatched all along the Mississippi River. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, tragically, and almost overnight, Clyde lost everything he had - his fortune, company, prestige and the two women for whom he had won the worlds as he knew it; Lucy and his beloved daughter Cary. All that was left him was the crumbling remains of his business and Larry Vincent, his grandson. But although Larry was a mere babe in arms, the child was to give Clyde Batchelor someone to live and work for; he was to grow up to be Clyde's constant companion - and, like his grandfather before him, Larry was to meet and fall violently in love with a beautiful, gentle but inaccessible lady...</description>

  <description>The only thing bigger than the storm in Michelle's heart is the blizzard raging across the Alberta prairie outside her window. Finding an injured stray dog is the last thing she needs. Add to the mix the handsome new vet who is taking over her beloved Doc's practice and peace of mind is not in the picture. Cale Benjamin is too nice to be for real. Michelle is still smarting from being jilted by her high school sweetheart fiance and not in the mood to trust any man, let alone one as drop dead gorgeous as Dr. Cale Benjamin DVM. The injured stray, Storm, keeps putting Michelle in Cale's path whether she likes it or no. She is distressed to find that the handsome young vet is sliding past her carefully erected defenses and into her heart. A few well placed nudges from Doc's match maker wife, Mary, help the young doctor's cause, but will it be enough to make the lady rancher allow him into her life? The answer lies in the pages of Storm's Refuge, find out for yourself."</description>

  <description>Lexi takes a huge risk going to Kenya to marry a man she hardly knows. It seems only to be expected that her fiance's family will, initially, be suspicious about her. After all, they are part of the wealthy elite, whereas she is an unknown quantity. However, she's not prepared for the attitude of her arrogant, controlling future brother-in-law. Morgan Tyler seems prepared to stop at nothing to make her feel unwelcome. But Fate plays tricks on them both...</description>

  <description>"In 'Steamboat Gothic' Mrs. Keyes tells not only the story of the great Louisiana plantations, but of the river which contributed so largely to their prosperity, their prestige and their splendor. Plantations and the river, and the loves and lives of the men and women who peopled them come alive in a superb novel which is all the more truly a great contribution to Americana because it is a great love story."</description>

  <description>As a young woman must marry and become engaged in proper duties, art can only be an accomplishment and a recreation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite opposition at every turn, Charity Baxendale dreams of becoming a renowned portrait painter. She is heartened to receive two significant commissions from esteemed family members, and when a rakish Scottish baron commissions her to do his portrait, she dares hope she is one step closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Robin, Lord Stanberry, with whom Charity has had a long friendship, asks her to marry him, she must choose between marriage and her career. Robin is heir to a dukedom, and Charity fears that not only would she be unsuited to life as a duchess, but also that her burgeoning career might end before it begins. And besides, Robin has made no mention of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his uncle and heir die, Robin becomes the Duke of Harwood. Never having expected such an event, he feels himself unfitted for such a position. He was perfectly content living as a viscount in Tunbridge Wells, writing a manuscript on ornithology. Now he must leave all that he loves. He’d hoped to have Charity at his side by the time he took his place at Harwood Castle, for her pragmatic nature and strength of character would be of enormous help to him. Should he have thrown himself at her feet and declared an undying love? Charity would have seen through it, for that was not the sort of friendship they enjoyed. But her refusal has brought him lower than he’d thought possible. Can he change her mind, despite the distance that now lay between them?</description>

  <description>Angela Thirkell writes of her late Victorian childhood, in which her memory inhabits the three houses which shaped the sensibility later displayed in her beloved Barsetshire novels. First, there is her maternal grandparents home in Fulham, "The Grange," where her grandfather, the celebrated Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir Edward Burne-Jones, set the cultivated tone enjoyed by family and friends alike (such as William Morris). Second is her parents' home in Kensington Square in which the young Angela was surrounded by a bright world of neighbors and acquaintances. At the heart of Thirkell's reminiscences was the Burne-Jones's seaside retreat- North End House in Rottingdean- where Thirkell's grandmother was the presiding genius and her cousin, Rudyard Kipling, lived across the green.</description>

  <description>They came from England - thieves, felons, murderers, justly and unjustly accused - human cargo destined to hack a life from the harsh Australian wilderness. Packed into the teemed holds of His Majesty's ships. they sailed treacherous seas to the icy desolation of Antarctica, to the South Cape of Tasmania, to Captain Cook's anchorage in Botany Bay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a cruel, violent fate for fifteen-year-old Jenny Taggart. Falsely accused of theft, she was torn from her loved ones, a beautiful child among hardened convicts, an innocent in the craft of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayed by her beauty, sustained by courage, she would endure to become Queen of the Convicts, target of passion and vengeance in a raw, merciless land...</description>

  <description>In "Hand-me-Down Bride," Sophie found her knight in shining armor, the miller’s son, Karl. He’s arranged to have her sisters come from Germany to seek their own happily ever-afters in 1870’s Pennsylvania. Little sister Elfie is cut from another bolt than her serious, tender-hearted older sister. Elfie is something of a material girl, and her Aunt, who’d arranged Sophie’s first marriage—to a rich old man—is ready to encourage her striking niece in her search for a life of comfort. Elfie doesn’t want to work the way her farm wife sister does, and her looks straightaway carry her into friendships with the local belles. With three very different men vying for her hand, everyone in valley is wondering who will catch this lovely butterfly.</description>

  <description>It’s tough for Kira, growing up in the small town of Hope as a child prodigy in classical violin, especially when her dad just died. And to make matters worse, Kate McDonough, the red-haired fiddler appears out of nowhere and bewitches the town with her mysterious Celtic music. Even Uncle Jack succumbs to her charms, forgetting his promise to look after Kira’s family. But when someone begins vandalizing the town leaving dead and gutted girds as a calling card, Kira knows without a doubt who’s behind it.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>WHAT HIDES BEHIND THE MASK takes place in Venice, the ancient Italian city famous for love and intrigue. Doctor Chiara Mackenzie Davis and her stepbrother Chas Weston find this out first hand when they must travel to Italy and discover the reason why Francesca Severino, Chiara's 84 year-old grandmother, travels to Venice-a place she has no reason to visit-without telling anyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chas needs to know the answer and he can't ask Francesca. She checked into the luxurious Cipriani Hotel-something at odds with her habitual thrift minded outlook-where she died the next day. The situation becomes more complicated when Chiara meets family she didn't know existed. However, the Cavaliere Orlando Paladino and his son, Father Girardo Paladino have their own questions about Francesca's visit. When Girardo's cousins show up, the atmosphere thickens with intrigue, which boils over with the arrival of Chas's mother, who comes to Venice in time for the funeral. Chiara and Chas find the answers they seek. However, along the way they must also find the answers to their own personal mysteries and discover the person who hides behind the mask each of them&lt;br /&gt;wears.</description>

  <description>After her four sisters married for love, Mercy Baxendale, in her first London Season, wants the same for herself. Her requirements are simple. The man she marries must be madly in love with her, and he must also be prepared to support her business venture. &lt;br /&gt;When an incident lands Mercy and Grant Viscount Northcliffe in the scandal sheets and has everyone in London talking, they are forced into a marriage of convenience. Although Northcliffe is quite the most handsome man she’s met, he does not fill her criterion for a husband. Not only does he appear to be a man with secrets, he has a very public mistress. &lt;br /&gt;Grant foresees no rush to marry and produce an heir. His grandfather, the Duke of Rotherham, and Grant’s father are still above ground. And squiring a fiancée around London for the Season is difficult with the dangerous work he’s undertaken for the Crown. &lt;br /&gt;While he accepts that circumstances have thrust marriage upon him, he wishes his reluctant fiancée would be warmer. There’s a decidedly chilly expression in her beautiful blue eyes when she looks at him. &lt;br /&gt;Will they find it possible to overcome their differences and love one another, or will his secrets destroy their chance of happiness? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>1864 - Suddenly left as the head of the family, Kitty McKenzie must find her inner strength to keep her family together against the odds. Evicted from their resplendent home in the fashionable part of York after her parents’ deaths, Kitty must fight the legacy of bankruptcy and homelessness to secure a home for her and her siblings. Through sheer willpower and determination she grabs opportunities with both hands from working on a clothes and rag stall in the market to creating a teashop for the wealthy. Her road to happiness is fraught with obstacles of hardship and despair, but she refuses to let her dream of a better life for her family die. She soon learns that love and loyalty brings its own reward.</description>

  <description>Who murdered Lady Pentreath? The year is 1781, and the war with the American colonies rages across the sea. In Truro, England Branek Pentreath, a local squire, has suffered for years in a miserable marriage. Now his wife has been poisoned with arsenic. Is this unhappy husband responsible? Or was it out of revenge? Branek owns the apothecary shop where Jenna Rosedew, two years a widow, delights in serving her clients. Branek might sell her building to absolve his debts caused by the war—and put her out on the street. Jenna prepared the tinctures for Lady Pentreath, which were later found to contain arsenic. The town’s corrupt constable has a grudge against Branek and Jenna. He threatens to send them both to the gallows.</description>

  <description>A lonely wanderer... A magical island... And Two People Bewitched By Love....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Channel Islands were divided in allegiance between France and England. Of French blood, and yet subjects of Queen Victoria, the islanders were curious hybrid creatures. But now, in 1888, England is slowly stretching out her arms to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin du Frocq is eight years old, and his dreams are of the sea that surrounds his home. By day he steals away and takes to the sea in any boat that is sailing. At night he lies in bed listening to the waves beating against the shore. Then one night, in a wild storm, a ship drives onto the nearby cliffs and a strange man enters Colin's life, changing Colin's course forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A twist of fate brought Ranulph back to a springtime place that had forgotten him. A proud and beautiful woman offered him refuge, even though she did not understand why, as she trembled before his gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Ranulph could feel the spell of the Island twisting around him, binding him to the world of love and companionship he had rejected forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A storm-wracked sea had brought him home. It was the magnificent fury of another storm that taught him the splendor of life and the power of love.</description>

  <description>John Haldane, Earl of Strathairn, is on an urgent mission to find the killer of his fellow spy. Has the treasonous Frenchman, Count Forney, returned to England to wreak havoc? Or has someone new landed on English shores to stir up rebellion in the Midlands? After visiting the young widow of one of his agents, Strathairn strengthens his resolve never to wed. And most certainly not to Lady Sibella Winborne, with her romantic ideas of love and marriage. Unable to give Sibella up entirely, he has kept her close as a friend. And then weak fool that he is he kissed her... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lady Sibella Winborne has refused several offers of marriage since her first Season years ago -- when she first set eyes on the handsome Earl of Strathairn. Sibella's many siblings always rush to her aid to discourage an ardent suitor, but not this time. Her elder brother, Chaloner, Marquess of Brandreth, is insisting she marry. Sibella yearns to set up her own household. She is known to be the sensible member of the family. But she doesn't feel at all sensible about Lord Strathairn. If only she could forget that kiss...</description>

  <description>Margaret Mitchell was as complex and compelling as her legendary heroine, Scarlett O’Hara, and her story is as dramatic as anything out of her own imagination—indeed, it is the basis for the legend she created. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/i&gt; took the American reading public by storm and went on to become the most popular motion picture of all time. It was a phenomenon whose success has never been equaled—and it shattered Margaret Mitchell’s private life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this commemorative reprint of &lt;i&gt;Road to Tara,&lt;/i&gt; Anne Edwards tells the real story of Margaret Mitchell and the extraordinary novel that has become part of our heritage.</description>

  <description>Isabelle, a young French maid, follows her notorious mistress to the island of St. Helena after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo. She discovers quickly that a “beast” roams this remote island, and people are vanishing or found drained of blood. She falls in love with Saint-Denis, Napoleon’s valet, but this enigmatic young man hides a deadly secret. Hudson Lowe, the island’s governor—a vampire himself—plans to destroy the French. Isabelle rushes with her lover to stop the vicious outcome, and save her own life.</description>

  <description>Books We Love presents a special edition comprising the first three novels in Vijaya Schartz' Curse of the Lost Isle series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curse of the Lost Isle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From history shrouded in myths, emerges a family of immortal Celtic Ladies, who roam the medieval world in search of salvation from a curse. For centuries, imbued with hereditary gifts, they hide their deadly secret... but if the Church ever suspects what they really are, they will be hunted, tortured, and burned at the stake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess of Bretagne&lt;br /&gt;As the Vikings raid the coast of Alba, Pressine of Bretagne sets out to seduce King Elinas of Dumfries, chosen by the Goddess to unite the tribes against the foreign invader. Elinas, still mourning his departed queen, has no intention to remarry. Head‑strong and independent, Pressine does not expect to fall for the very attractive, wise and noble ruler... Furthermore, her Pagan nature clashes with the religious fanaticism of the king’s Christian heir, who suspects her unholy ancestry and will stop at nothing to get rid of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pagan Queen&lt;br /&gt;Queen at last, Pressine brings victory to her beloved Elinas and prosperity to their growing kingdom. But she has to contend with the intrigues of Charlemagne's bishops, spurred by her Christian stepson. She also fears the curse that could bring her downfall. For the love of Elinas, she will tempt fate and become with child. But when her indomitable passion challenges the wrath of the Goddess Herself. . . can she win that battle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seducing Sigefroi&lt;br /&gt;To offset the curse that makes her a serpent from the waist down one day each month, Melusine, exiled Princess of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strathclyde, must seduce and wed a mortal knight, the shrewd and ambitious Sigefroi of Ardennes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigefroi, son of the Duke of Lorraine, suspects Melusine is not what she appears, but her beauty, her rich dowry, and her sharp political skills serve his ambitions. He never expected her to soften his stone-cold warrior heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So close to the Imperial court, dangers and intrigue threaten Melusine. War looms on the horizon, a Mermaid was sighted around Luxembourg, and Sigefroi’s bishop brother questions her ancestry. If anyone ever suspects Melusine’s true nature, she will burn at the stake...</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A young woman becomes a governess to two grieving orphans in the latest powerful historical romance from Janet Woods&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1835. Clementine Morris, despite her youth and inexperience, is hired by Zachariah Fleet to care for his recently orphaned niece and nephew. He tells her he wishes the young children to have more than a governess, and her heart goes out to the grieving infants. Clementine, too, is an orphan, and all alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But little does she know that Zachariah Fleet is interested in her for more than just her usefulness as a governess. He believes she is a distant relation of his by marriage, and there is a chance she is a legatee for a useful amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are troubles ahead, though, when another young woman turns up with a claim to the inheritance . . . and troubles for Zachariah too. The self-possessed, wealthy businessman has never allowed himself to fall in love, but as he grows to trust Clementine he realises that he may be falling for her.</description>

  <description>In the autumn of 1140 the Benedictine monastery at Shrewsbury finds its new novice Meriet Aspley a bit disturbing. The younger son of a prominent family, Meriet is meek and biddable by day, but his sleep is rife with nightmares so violent that they earn him the name of "Devil's Novice". Shunned by the other monks, Aspley attracts the concern of Brother Cadfael. Then a body appears, that of a young priest last seen at the Aspley estate. Can Meriet be involved in the death? As events take a sinister turn, it falls to Brother Cadfael to detect the truth.</description>

Then a stranger comes into her life offering the most dangerous substance in the world: hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devlin, a security consultant and witness to the terrible accident scene, inadvertently reveals that Kaz’s daughter might not have been the girl in the car after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Jamie is still alive? With no evidence, the police aren’t interested, so Devlin and Kaz have little choice but to investigate themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devlin never gets involved with a client. Never. But the more time he spends with Kaz, the more he desires her – and the more his carefully constructed ice-man persona starts to unravel .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The desperate search for Jamie leads down dangerous paths – to a murderous acquaintance from Devlin’s dark past, and all across Europe, to Italy, where deadly secrets await. But as long as Kaz has hope, she can’t stop looking…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A contemporary romantic thriller, set in London, Italy and the US. A complex mystery plot as well as a gorgeous romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evonne describes Devlin, the hero, in terms of chocolate:&lt;br /&gt;Extremely dark and slightly bitter, spicy with a surprising sweetness in the aftertaste. Hmm ... perhaps a dark chocolate rum truffle - perhaps!</description>

  <description>Autumn 1928. The &lt;i&gt;Kaiser-i-Hind&lt;/i&gt; is en route to Bombay. In Cabin D38, Viva Hollowat, an inexperienced chaperone, is worried she's made a terrible mistake. Her advert in &lt;i&gt;The Lady&lt;/i&gt; has resulted in three unsettling charges to be escorted to India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose, a beautiful, dangerously naive English girl, is about to be married to the cavalry officer she has met only a handful of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria, the bridesmaid, is determined to lose her virginity on the journey before finding a husband of her own in India. And overshadowing all three of them, the malevolent presence of Guy Glover, a strange and disturbed schoolboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three potential Memsahibs with a myriad of reasons for leaving England, but the cargo of hopes and secrets they carry has done little to prepare them for what lies ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the parties of the wealthy Bombay socialites to the poverty of the orphans on Tamarind Street, &lt;i&gt;East of the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is everything a historical novel should be: alive with glorious detail, fascinating characters and masterful storytelling.</description>

  <description>In the idyllic early summer of 1914, life is good for the de Witt family. Rudolf and Verena are planning the wedding of their daughter, Emmeline, while their eldest son Arthur is studying in Paris and Tom is just back from his first term at Cambridge. Celia, the youngest of the de Witt children, is on the brink of adulthood, and secretly dreams of escaping her carefully mapped out future and exploring the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the onslaught of war changes everything and soon the de Witts find themselves sidelined and in danger of losing everything they hold dear. As Celia struggles to make sense of the changing world around her, she lies about her age to join the war effort and finds herself embroiled in a complex plot that puts her and those she loves in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gripping detail and brilliant empathy, Kate Williams tells the story of Celia and her family as they are shunned by a society that previously embraced them, torn apart by sorrow, and buffeted and changed by the storms of war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Scandal, affairs and betrayal abound in ALMOST A CRIME by Penny Vincenzi - perfect for any fan of Kate Morton's &lt;i&gt;The Lake House&lt;/i&gt;, or Harriet Evans' &lt;i&gt;The Butterfly Summer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Deliciously readable' &lt;i&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom and Octavia Fleming have the perfect power marriage: he is a spin-doctor and she runs a consultancy to the charity industry. They are attractive, rich and successful. Then Octavia discovers Tom is having an affair, and both the discovery and the affair itself have consequences that are potentially fatal. For this is no ordinary affair, but one that leads to terror and danger, and threatens to damage people's lives for ever.</description>

  <description>In Angela Thirkell's first Barsetshire novel, she sets the plot pattern which will be played out in most of her later books. She also introduces us to specific characters as well as 'types' who will appear and reappear in changing relationships as the years go by. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the middle-aged woman centrally involved in the events and activities around her; here, Laura Morland, a happily widowed author of very successful 'good bad books' (Thirkell herself?). A disappointed suitor and/or a brief, ill-conceived infatuation of younger man with older woman. There are at least two romances to work out, an older couple and a younger one with mild crises along the way. A closing of ranks among the women vs 'the Incubus' resolves both affairs to the satisfaction of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially delightful are the children, servants and other retainers; well defined characters in their own right; from motor-mouthed young Tony Morland and his model railways to housekeeper, Stoker, and her grapevine among the servants of the neighbourhood.</description>

  <description>Madeline (Maddie to her friends), an Australian history teacher, travels to York, England, to visit her friend Amber who is working there with a team of archaeologists unearthing Viking relics. They share a passion for the Viking Age, and both studied the Old Norse language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About to take part in a re-enactment at the Viking village and wearing typical clothes worn by a Viking woman, they are swept back in time to the town of Jorvik, a thriving trading town, as York was in the year 879 AD. Maddie meets Norse trader Erik and is stunned by his uncanny resemblance to the Viking she has been dreaming of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Amber is kidnapped, Maddie persuades Erik to help her find her friend. Their journey takes them across to France and to Rouen, then further inland. They encounter misadventures on their perilous journey. Erik risks everything to aid Madeline in her quest. And the fear is always there; will she stay in the past to share her hero’s life, or be snatched back to her own time?</description>

  <description>East London, 1888 - a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Fiona's life is shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit propels her rise from a modest West Side shop-front to the top of Manhattan's tea trade. But Fiona's old ghosts do not rest quietly, and to silence them, she must venture back to the London of her childhood, where a deadly confrontation with her past becomes the key to her future.</description>

  <description>This is the inspirational story of life as a nurse during the 1970s at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Susan Macqueen was 12 years old when she accompanied her mother to see her friend Ms. Fairweather, the matron at the local nursing home, and from that day on she knew she wanted to be a nurse. A few years later, despite being told that her grades weren't good enough, Susan was accepted on the three-year nurses training course at Addenbooke's hospital in Cambridge. It wasn't long before Susan knew she wanted to work with children and set her sights on a job at Great Ormond Street. Thirty-five years later, on her third attempt, Susan has finally retired from that iconic hospital and is enjoying a more leisurely pace of life. Hope, despair, laughter, and tears, Susan's stories move the reader through the incredible stories that she was faced with on an every day basis.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Every time I see the King and the Queen, I am reminded of what it is I have done, and then I am afraid, I am beyond all expression afraid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wicked, bawdy Restoration court is no place for a child princess. Ten-year-old Anne cuts an odd figure: a sickly child, she is drawn towards improper pursuits. Cards, sweetmeats, scandal and gossip with her Ladies of the Bedchamber figure large in her life. But as King Charles's niece, Anne is also a political pawn, who will be forced to play her part in the troubled Stuart dynasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Anne grows to maturity, she is transformed from overlooked Princess to the heiress of England. Forced to overcome grief for her lost children, the political manoeuvrings of her sister and her closest friends and her own betrayal of her father, she becomes one of the most complex and fascinating figures of English history.</description>

  <description>Sara, a therapist, always thought her husband Mike died in Afghanistan - but when she learns he was actually killed in India, her desire to uncover the truth leads her to a clinic in New Delhi. Once in India Sara is dazzled by the country's culture and its people. At the clinic, she grows close both to her patient Pritti and a bewitching, low-caste driver named Hemant. Yet Sara finds herself increasingly appalled at the treatment of women; in this country of old traditions and new opportunities, so much remains shocking or forbidden, like the practice of 'Devadasi' - prostitutes who work at temples. As Sara inches towards the truth about Mike's death and their marriage, and becomes entangled in the dark side of Delhi, she is thrust into the terrifying reality of an India few Westerners ever see.</description>

  <description>Two women, centuries apart. One endless nightmare tearing Wales apart – and only they can stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday Times bestselling author Barbara Erskine returns to Hay in the year that marks the 30th anniversary of her sensational debut bestseller, Lady of Hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hay-On-Wye, 1400 – War is brewing in the Welsh borders, Catrin is on the brink of womanhood and falling in love for the first time. Her father is a soothsayer, playing a dangerous game playing on the mixed loyalties and furious rivalries between welsh princes and English lords. For two hundred years, the Welsh people have lain under the English yoke, dreaming of independence. And finally it looks as though the charismatic Owain Glyndwr may be the man legend tralks of. In the walls of Sleeper’s Castle, Catrin finds herself caught in the middle of a doomed war as she is called upon to foretell Wales’s destiny… And what she sees, is blood and war coming closer…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hay, 2015. Miranda has moved to Sleeper’s Castle to escape and grieve. Slowly she feels herself coming to life in the solitude of the mountains. But every time she closes her eyes her dreams become more vivid. And she makes a connection with a young girl, who’s screaming, who’s reaching out… who only Miranda can help. Is she losing herself to time?</description>

  <description>Three women, one shared ambition: to join the ATS and do their bit for King and country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea has grown up part of a large, boisterous East End family. But her sweetheart is missing in action, and her mother is controlling her life. She needs to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edie inhabits a world of wealth and privilege, but knows only too well that money can't buy happiness. She wants to be like Mary Churchill, to make a difference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan can't remember much of her past or her family, and her home has been bombed in the Blitz. Desperate, she needs a refuge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one is a Gunner Girl: three very different women, one remarkable wartime friendship of shared hopes, lost loves and terrible danger.</description>

  <description>Haunted by memories of the 7th Crusade, Warin de Taillur vows to lay down his sword and embrace the monastic life. But first, rescuing an urchin abandoned by a French roadside will be the first step in his absolution. When he discovers the urchin is a young noble woman in need of protection, against his better judgment he agrees to return her home to England. Love for her soon overwhelms him but it’s a love he must hold at bay for he has nothing to offer her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven from her home, Caperun Keep, by a deceitful aunt, Alyna Caperun must place her trust in the brooding Crusader who rescues her. As the only means to recover her castle, she consents to marrying Warin even though she knows he could never love her for anything but her lands. Knows too, he battles demons not even she can fathom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they find love? Or will Warin’s past destroy any chance they have of finding happiness together?</description>

  <description>George, Earl of Haworth, has died in a riding accident and left Haworth Park in disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Nicholas Bonham of Wellington’s Peninsular Regiment, the 52nd Light Infantry, returns from fighting the Napoleonic wars to see his brother laid to rest. A skilled rider, George’s death remains a mystery, as does the parlous state of his finances. Haworth Park must be sold unless Nicholas can find a swift solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his neighbor, Sir Marcus Mirrington offers Nicholas an answer to his problems, Nicholas accepts his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Miss Caroline Mirrington harbors a dangerous secret of her own.</description>

  <description>It's 1928, and the globetrotting, glamorous Phryne (rhymes with briny) is at home near Melbourne, missing her lover, Lin Chung, who is on a silk-buying trip in China. When Phryne's detective friend, Jack, asks for her help investigating the murder of Miss Lavender, a well-known author of fairy stories, Phryne is glad of the distraction. The investigation leads to a temporary job as a fashion reporter for Women's Choice magazine, Miss Lavender's former employer. Phryne's encounters with the various magazine staffers add considerable zest to the adventure, as does Lin Chung's possible abduction by pirates.</description>

  <description>he Bankrupt Viscount, Book 1 in Caitlyn Callery's series, Hadlow, continues with Incognito... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last three years, Grace Thompson has lived in hiding, under an assumed name. Now her hard-won security is threatened and her past is catching up to her. Can she rely on a newcomer to the village who has an unsettling way of trying to help? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Fielding suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself heir to an earldom. Uncertain about his new role and the changes it has wrought, he does not broadcast his true status when he comes to stay in Crompton Hadlow. As the lowly clerk he once was, he would have had no hesitation in courting Grace. Sadly, as a mere governess, she cannot now be a suitable match. But when he realizes she has secrets of her own, and those secrets put her in jeopardy, he must take action. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they stave off the threats to her life and liberty, Grace finds she faces a greater danger: losing her heart to a man she cannot have.</description>

  <description>Born into rural poverty, Gabrielle Chanel and her siblings are sent to orphanage after their mother’s death. The sisters nurture Gabrielle’s exceptional sewing skills, a talent that will propel the willful young woman into a life far removed from the drudgery of her childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transforming herself into Coco—a seamstress and sometime torch singer—the petite brunette burns with ambition, an incandescence that draws a wealthy gentleman who will become the love of her life. She immerses herself in his world of money and luxury, discovering a freedom that sparks her creativity. But it is only when her lover takes her to Paris that Coco discovers her destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rejecting the frilly, corseted silhouette of the past, her sleek, minimalist styles reflect the youthful ease and confidence of the 1920s modern woman. As Coco’s reputation spreads, her couturier business explodes, taking her into rarefied society circles and bohemian salons. But her fame and fortune cannot save her from heartbreak as the years pass. And when Paris falls to the Nazis, Coco is forced to make choices that will haunt her.</description>

  <description>1792. As a teacher at her parents' Academy for Young Ladies in the heart of London, Madeleine Moreau has lived her life sheltered from the outside world. But on the night of a dazzling Masquerade, tragedy strikes and she is left alone in the world. Desperate to find the family she never knew, Madeleine impulsively travels to France in search of them. But with war around the corner, and fearing for Madeleine's safety, the enigmatic Comte Etienne d'Aubery offers her shelter at his home, Chateau Mirabelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chateau Mirabelle enchants Madeleine with its startling beauty, but it is a place of dark and haunting secrets. As the Revolution gathers momentum and the passions of the populace are enflamed, Madeleine must take control of her own destiny and unravel events of the past in order to secure a chance at future happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chateau on the Lake is a breath-taking historical novel set during the time of the French Revolution; rich, evocative and immersive. If you love Philippa Gregory and Joanne Harris, you will adore Charlotte Betts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if you were trapped between two cultures?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life is tough in 1870s Wyoming. But it’s tougher still when you’re a girl who looks Chinese but speaks like an American. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Orphaned as a baby and taken in by an American family, Charity Walker knows this only too well. The mounting tensions between the new Chinese immigrants and the locals in the mining town of Carter see her shunned by both communities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Charity’s one friend, Joe, leaves town, she finds herself isolated. However, in his absence, a new friendship with the only other Chinese girl in Carter makes her feel like she finally belongs somewhere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, for a lost girl like Charity, finding a place to call home was never going to be that easy … &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>1786 October A crisp autumn day. The “river of hawks” flows above a sunlit field… Lazy smudges of smoke rise from the stone chimney of a small cabin where three young children play while their parents lay fence. The eldest sister stacks rails in the woods. She wishes she was spending the lovely day anywhere else. The cabin lies just off “The War Path,” an ancient trail soaked with the blood of Shawnee and Iroquois who once both lay claim to this land. The Iroquois are long gone, but Shawnee are plentiful, and they continue to wage the late war of their British Fathers. They raid the homes of those who encroach on their territory, or lure them to watery deaths on the Ohio River. More than 3000 settlers in the Ohio River Valley have been carried into captivity since 1783, when the war officially ended with The Treaty of Paris. The Shawnee are left on the side of the losers. For safety’s sake, the Flynn family and others have been staying at a nearby fort. But they must return to their land to build a fence, to make “an improvement” desired by the young US government through provisions of the Northwest Ordinance. This improvement makes the Flynns eligible for hundreds of additional acres. They race against the approach of winter. And Shawnee raiders. At the gobbling of wild turkeys, the Flynns halt in their tasks. A moment later, blasts from Indian rifles blow their world apart. Nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>Some dreams shouldn’t come true … &lt;br /&gt;Maddie Browne thought she’d grown out of the recurring nightmare that plagued her as a child, but after a shocking family secret is revealed, it comes back to haunt her – the same swing in the same garden, the kind red-haired giant and the swarthy arms which grab her from behind and try to take her away … &lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to forget her troubles, Maddie travels to Devon to spend time with her friends, Kayla and Wes. However, it becomes clear that relaxation will not be on the agenda after a disturbing encounter with a gypsy fortune teller. Not to mention the presence of Wes’s dangerously handsome brother, Alex. &lt;br /&gt;And then there’s the fact that Maddie’s dream seems to be coming true … &lt;br /&gt;The Soft Whisper of Dreams is the follow-on to Christina Courtenay’s novel The Secret Kiss of Darkness.</description>

  <description>Even though Agatha Raisin loathes Christmas panto, her friend Mrs Bloxby, the vicar's wife, has persuaded her to support the local am dram society in their festive offering. Stifling a yawn at the production of &lt;i&gt;Babes in the Wood&lt;/i&gt;, Agatha watches the baker playing an ogre strut and threaten on stage until a trapdoor opens... followed by a scream and silence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely this wasn't the way the scene was rehearsed? When it turns out the local baker had been murdered most horribly, Agatha puts her team of detectives on the case. And they soon discover more feuds and temperamental behaviour in amateur dramatics than in a professional stage show - and face more and more danger as Agatha and her team get too close to the killer...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;[Alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17312058-viaggiare-il-mio-peccato" rel="nofollow"&gt;ISBN 8804508418 / 9788804508410&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nel 1930 Aghata Christie, già celebre scrittrice, sposava in seconde nozze il giovane archeologo Max Mallowan, decisa a seguire il marito nelle sue spedizioni in Paesi come la Siria o l’Iraq. Nacque così questo libro di memorie, un resoconto di viaggi ironico e autoironico, candido e malizioso, discreto e sincero in cui l’autrice rievoca avventure e disavventure di una tranquilla signora della buona borghesia inglese.</description>

  <description>As Christmas 1938 approaches, the staff at the Nightingale Hospital have their own wishes for the festive season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ward sister Frannie Wallace is hoping she won't have to live through another war like the one that claimed her beloved fiance. But with bomb defences going up all around London, it seems as if her hopes are in vain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staff Nurse Helen Dawson wants to find happiness again after the death of her husband Charlie. A handsome stranger seems to offer the chance she wants. But is she looking for love in the wrong place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matron Kathleen Fox struggles to keep up morale amongst her nurses as the hospital faces the threat of evacuation. But while everyone else worries about the future of the Nightingale, it's for her own future that Kathleen truly fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the country prepares itself for war, one thing is for sure - by the time next Christmas comes, nothing at the Nightingale Hospital will be the same again.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;"THERE IS NO ONE. I TRAVEL ALONE. I LIVE ALONE. ALWAYS."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battle-scarred Thrand the Destroyer has only one thing on his mind: settling old scores. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But with the beautiful Lady of Lingfold as his prisoner, the unyielding warrior starts to dream of a loving wife and a home to call his own.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cwen is also seeking justice, but she knows the fragile alliance she's built with Thrand will only last as long as they share a common enemy. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Unless they can find a way to leave revenge to the gods to forge a new life together.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>A loud, hissing sound filled the air. The unicorns looked up, their eyes filled with horror.&lt;p&gt;Azaria, a unicorn colt, is intrigued when the young, clairvoyant dinosaur, Darius, foresees a terrifying change to their world. When a giant fireball smashes into the earth, the unicorns struggle to survive the hurricanes and starvation that follow. But nothing compares to the danger when the creatures-that-walk-on-two-legs settle in the valley, and their leader discovers the healing power in the unicorns’ horns. Greedy and ruthless, Ishmael will stop at nothing in his pursuit of wealth – even the complete extinction of the herd. Azaria must find a way to outsmart Ishmael before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Henry Tudor wants the infant Scots Queen in England, married to his six-year-old son, Edward. Since she won't come willingly, he sends out the order that she be brought south by force. Young Englishmen Matho Spirston and his good friend Harry Wharton accept the challenge and head north of the border, hoping to gain the promised reward. Matho falls foul of the king's niece, bold beauty Meg Douglas, who has her own problems with ambitious Lord Lennox. Her trickery forces Matho to use his wits and all his courage to survive in this brutal world of political intrigue. Watching them all and constantly balancing one man against another is Marie de Guise, the widowed Dowager Queen who fears for the safety of her only surviving child, Mary, Queen of Scots.&lt;br /&gt;A fast-paced dramatic story set in Stirling, Scotland in the year 1543.</description>

  <description>Lizzie Flint learns things a 10-year-old shouldn't know. During WWI, she learns that her father, Peter, is missing in action, that she and her mother will have to live with her grandmother until he is found and that her mother, Beth, refuses to believe him dead. She learns that her father was a hero, saving other soldier's lives, but was finally blown up by a land mine and, ultimately, that Beth will never recover from hearing the news. Grown, Lizzie develops an adventurous streak. She travels to Hong Kong to take up a teaching post. There, she meets and falls in love with an author, Jonas O'Neill. They marry, but Jonas is sent to Shanghai to report on the Japanese bombings and the two are separated. Not knowing the fate of the other, Lizzie frantically searches for Jonas, all the while fearing that, just like her father, she may never see Jonas again. &lt;i&gt;Dragon Land&lt;/i&gt; is an epic story set across generations of the Flint family as they battle war and conflict throughout the world as World War I, the Japanese invasion of China, and finally Word War II rage on around them and rips the family apart. It is a story of love, hope, and survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This book is no longer for sale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King George sends his private investigator, an Irishman, Kieran Flynn, Lord Montsimon, on a mission, the reason for which is unclear. Is it a plot against the Crown? Or something entirely unrelated? Flynn's inquiries lead him to the widow, Lady Althea Brookwood. Known amongst the ton as a rake, Flynn is rarely turned down by a lady, and when Althea refuses not just him but many other men, he becomes intrigued. After her neighbor, Sir Harold Crowthorne informs Althea that he means to take her country property, Owltree Cottage, by fair means or foul, she must search for help. The first man she turns to is promptly murdered and the second lies to her. That leaves Flynn, Lord Montsimon, a man she has been studiously avoiding. But Montsimon is decidedly unhelpful, and more than a little mysterious. Her only option is to seduce him. Althea has little confidence that she will succeed, especially as before her husband was killed in a duel, he often told her she was quite hopeless at intimacy. When a spy is murdered, Flynn wonders just what Althea knows and what her involvement might be with the man the king wants Flynn to investigate.</description>

  <description>Carolina, the Contessina DeSimone, is young, beautiful, and wealthy. Helpless in her father's quest for power, she finds herself living at the Palazzo Reale in Turin as a lady-in-waiting and confidant of Margherita, the Princess of Savoy. When the childhood friend with whom she elopes dies while on mission for Pope Pius IX, Carolina finds herself disinherited and disowned by her father, the powerful Count Aurelio, financial advisor to Vittorio Emanuele II, the first King of a unified Italy. Left in disgrace at a dilapidated villa that once belonged to her late mother, Carolina is easy prey for the rogue elements who roam the 19th century Italian countryside until the mysterious Navarre comes to her rescue. He is a soldier of fortune once in the pay of King Francis II of the Two Sicilies, a hired mercenary accustomed to taking what he wants without regard for the consequences. What refuge could he possibly offer her-and why?</description>

  <description>It’s 1759 and Jamie Kinross has travelled far to escape his troubled past—from the pine forests of Sweden to the bustling streets of India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In India he becomes a gem trader, but when his mentor’s family are kidnapped as part of a criminal plot, he vows to save them and embarks on a dangerous mission to the city of Surat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There he encounters Zarmina Miller a rich and beautiful widow whose haughtiness has earned her a nickname: “The Ice Widow”. When they meet, Jamie is instantly tempted by the challenge she presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it becomes clear that Zarmina’s step-son is involved in the criminal plot, Jamie begins to see another side to her—a dark past to rival his own and a heart just waiting to be thawed. But is it too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monsoon Mists&lt;/i&gt; is the final in the series about the lives of the three Kinross men. The first was &lt;i&gt;Trade Winds&lt;/i&gt; followed by &lt;i&gt;Highland Storms&lt;/i&gt;. They can all be read as stand-alone novels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina's prequel to this novel won the 2012 Historical novel of the year award. Her novel &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Kimono&lt;/i&gt; won the Big Red Reads Best Historical Fiction Award and was short listed for the Festival of Romance Best Historical Read Award 2011. &lt;i&gt;The Gilded Fan&lt;/i&gt; is shortlisted for the 2014 UK's Historical Romantic Novel Award.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when you can fly, but you just can’t hide?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Jessica Pearson knows the truth when the press portrays her as the woman who betrayed her lover to escape prosecution. But will her new job flying an outback air ambulance help her sleep at night or atone for a lost life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Adam Gilmore touches the lives of his patients, but his own scars mean he can never let a woman touch his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runaway Ellen Parkes wants to build a safe future for her two children. Without a man—not even one as gentle as Jack North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Coorah Creek, a town on the edge of nowhere, you're judged by what you do, not what people say about you. But when the harshest judge is the one you see in the mirror, there's nowhere left to hide.</description>

  <description>THE ROAD WAS A RIBBON OF MOONLIGHT OVER THE PURPLE MOOR, AND THE HIGHWAYMAN CAME RIDING --- RIDING --- RIDING ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HIGHWAYMAN CAME RIDING, UP TO THE OLD INN DOOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though her father had been the legendary highwayman who lost his life for the innkeeper's daughter he loved, down-to-earth Lizzie Tynsdale had no use for romance. She had enough to do running the inn she'd inherited without falling for a handome face or a pair of broad shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a mysterious guest appeared at the inn one stormy night, it seemed history was destined to repeat itself. Once again, the redcoats were ordered to hunt down an innocent man, and Lizzie, like her mother before her, would risk her own safety to prevent his capture. For when the dark-eyed stranger took her in his arms for a heart-stopping kiss, she understood how a woman could defy death itself for the man of her dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is it a crime to steal a heart?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hounslow, 1768. Jack Blythe, heir to the Earl of Lampton, is a man with great expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when his stagecoach is held up by a masked woman, brandishing a pistol and dressed as a gentleman of the road, he wholly expects to have his purse stolen. And when he senses something strangely familiar about the lovely little bandit, Jack also expects to win his cousin Rupert s wager by tracking her down first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Jack and the highwaywoman enter into a swashbuckling game of cat and mouse, uncovering an intricate web of fiercely guarded family secrets, the last thing Jack expects to have stolen is his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henriette won the 2011 New Talent Award from the UK Festival of Romance for her debut &lt;i&gt;Up Close&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>"A House Divided," the third volume of the trilogy that began with "The Good Earth" and "Sons," is a powerful portrayal of China in the midst of revolution. Wang Yuan is caught between the opposing ideas of different generations. After 6 years abroad, Yuan returns to China in the middle of a peasant uprising. His cousin is a captain in the revolutionary army, his sister has scandalized the family by her premarital pregnancy, and his warlord father continues to cling to his traditional ideals. It is through Yuan's efforts that a kind of peace is restored to the family.</description>

  <description>In 1875, Sisi, the Empress of Austria is the woman that every man desires and every woman envies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, athletic and intelligent, Sisi has everything - except happiness. Bored with the stultifying etiquette of the Hapsburg Court and her dutiful but unexciting husband, Franz Joseph, Sisi comes to England to hunt. She comes looking for excitement and she finds it in the dashing form of Captain Bay Middleton, the only man in Europe who can outride her. Ten years younger than her and engaged to the rich and devoted Charlotte, Bay has everything to lose by falling for a woman who can never be his. But Bay and the Empress are as reckless as each other, and their mutual attraction is a force that cannot be denied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of passion and drama, THE FORTUNE HUNTER tells the true story of a nineteenth century Queen of Hearts and a cavalry captain, and the struggle between love and duty.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The tantalizing sequel to the blockbuster &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Chocolat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before it was adapted into the Oscar-nominated film starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp, Joanne Harris’s &lt;i&gt;Chocolat&lt;/i&gt; entranced readers with its mix of hedonism, whimsy, and, of course, chocolate. Now, at last, &lt;i&gt;Chocolat&lt;/i&gt;’s heroine returns to the beautiful French village of Lansquenet in another, equally beguiling tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vianne Rocher receives a letter from beyond the grave, she has no choice but to return to Lansquenet, where she once owned a chocolate shop and learned the meaning of home. But returning to one’s past can be a dangerous pursuit, and Vianne and her daughters find the beautiful French village changed in unexpected ways: women veiled in black, the scent of spices in the air, and—facing the church—a minaret. Most surprising of all, her old nemesis, Francis Reynaud, desperately needs her help. Can Vianne work her magic once again?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would they finally find happiness in Liverpool?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1930, Bridget O’Brien, a young widow with two children, fled her brutal and bigoted father and headed for Liverpool and an arranged marriage with a man she had never met. Her destination, the famous Scotland Road, was noisome and terrifying and a far cry from the clean air and flowing rivers of the only country she had known, Ireland. When she met her middle-aged bridegroom, Sam Bell, whose twin sons were older than she was, her sense of isolation only increased. Anthony, one of her so-called stepsons, also held out the strong hand of friendship, but Liam, the favourite of his father, had the power to terrify her. Liam was cold, compelling, mysterious and antagonistic. He was also a priest.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the vein of &lt;i&gt;Not Without My Daughter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Stolen: Escape from Syria &lt;/i&gt;is a memoir recounting a mother's crusade to rescue her kidnapped daughter from her abusive ex-husband during the tumultuous days of the Arab Spring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the middle of one of the worst civil wars in Syria's history, Louise Monaghan walked across a heavily guarded border to save her six-year-old child from the father who had callously snatched her from her home in Cyprus. Fearing for her daughter's future under the oppressive Sharia law, the Irish mother returned to her ex-husband, Mostafa Assad, to bide her time until she could escape with her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in his homeland, she too was held captive, locked inside a run-down house with little food and no hope of deliverance. Severely beaten by Mostafa —she was even left unconscious on the ground in front of their child—she and her little girl miraculously escaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This suspenseful account will pull at your heartstrings, enveloping you in harrowing events that no mother would dare imagine and culminating with the triumphal feats this mother achieved. Smuggled across a heavily patrolled mountain range in the dead of night through bomb attacks and sniper fire, Monaghan and her daughter speak to the transcendent bond between mother and child.</description>

  <description>In September 1838, a storm blows up on the Indian Ocean and the &lt;em&gt;Ibis&lt;/em&gt;, a ship carrying a consignment of convicts and indentured laborers from Calcutta to Mauritius, is caught up in the whirlwind. &lt;em&gt;River of Smoke&lt;/em&gt; follows its storm-tossed characters to the crowded harbors of China. There, despite efforts of the emperor to stop them, ships from Europe and India exchange their cargoes of opium for boxes tea, silk, porcelain and silver. Among them are Bahram Modi, a wealthy Parsi opium merchant out of Bombay, his estranged half-Chinese son Ah Fatt, the orphaned Paulette and a motley collection of others whose pursuit of romance, riches and a legendary rare flower have thrown together. All struggle to cope with their losses—and for some, unimaginable freedoms—in the alleys and crowded waterways of 19th-century Canton.</description>

  <description>FLAVIA'S SECRET [Historical Romance] Spirited, young scribe Flavia hopes for freedom. She and her fellow slaves in Aquae Sulis (modern Bath) have served the Lady Valeria for many years, but their mistress death brings a threat to Flavia s dream: her new master Marcus Brucetus, a charismatic, widowed officer toughened in the forests of Germania. Flavia finds him overwhelmingly attractive but she is aware of the danger. To save her life and those of her 'family' she has forged a note from her mistress. If her deception is discovered, all the slaves may die. For his part torn between attraction and respect, Marcus will not force himself on Flavia. Flavia by now knows of his grief over the deaths of his wife Drusilla and child. But how can she match up to the serene, flame-haired Drusilla? As the wild mid-winter festival of Saturnalia approaches, many lives will be changed forever. *** 4.5 Blue Ribbons: "Lindsay Townsend has thoroughly convinced me that I need to go back into time and become a scribe in ancient England. I lived and breathed Flavia's yearnings and love for Marcus throughout the pages of Flavia's Secret. Marcus was harder to read but no less important. His status as a widower afforded him the ability to try and stay untouched and out of reach of clinging females. I smiled when the one female who wanted to remain aloof from him was able to change his stance on love and worm her way into his heart. Releasing as an e-book first and then a print book later this year, Flavia's Secret is a passionate historical romance. Set in ancient England during Roman rule, I enjoyed reading about these two wonderful characters as well as the setting and town in which the novel took place. Marcus and Flavia were perfect for each other and this book was the perfect read for my ancient history loving soul. Thumbs up Ms. Townsend! I loved every word of Flavia's Secret!" --Natasha, Romance Junkies *** 4.5 Red Roses: "Marcus is home to take his inheritance and his eyes are always on Flavia. At first afraid of him, Flavia grows to like him, but Marcus believes that Lady Valeria was murdered. He has a suspect in mind--a man with evil in is heart, a man who wants Flavia and will stop at nothing to get her. An exciting mystery set in ancient Britain. The romance between Flavia and Marcus is strong and passionate, and the mystery is intriguing. Very enjoyable." --Morna, Red Roses Reviews *** 4 Books, Best Book of the Week: "In this wonderfully researched historical novel that gives us a rare look into a seldom described period, Lindsay Townsend weaves romance, intrigue, and historical fact into a unique and compelling story. The Roman town of Aquae Sulis, which we know today as Bath, springs to life in its ancient incarnation. Lindsay manages to present the classical world not with a modern bias, but through the eyes of those who were born and grew in it, those who find it ordinary and natural. The unusual time period gives the story a hue of fantasy, but the plot, the character's reactions, the motivations are solidly grounded in reality--both in the psychology of the characters and in the logic of the historical time. And Lindsay Townsend populates her ancient city with a colorful cast. Even the most minor characters are given due attention and spring to life for whatever short part they are called to play. The more important ones are unforgettable. Lindsay excels at adding the right small touch to make each one come to life and be remembered. Flavia's Secret is also an emotionally satisfying read. The story pulls the reader in to share the events and to empathize fully with the main characters. It is impossible to put it down once you've started to read it. Moreover, Lindsay Townsend has achieved what all writers strive for--the reader will wish the story would go on forever." --Cherry Blossom, Long and Short Reviews"</description>

  <description>From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes an epic saga of intrigue and mystique set in Edwardian England. Cavendon Hall is home to two families, the aristocratic Inghams and the Swanns who serve them. Charles Ingham, the sixth Earl of Mowbray, lives there with his wife Felicity and their six children. Walter Swann, the premier male of the Swann family, is valet to the earl. His wife Alice, a clever seamstress who is in charge of the countess's wardrobe, also makes clothes for the four daughters. For centuries, these two families have lived side-by-side, beneath the backdrop of the imposing Yorkshire manor. Lady Daphne, the most beautiful of the Earl's daughters, is about to be presented at court when a devastating event changes her life and threatens the Ingham name. With World War I looming, both families will find themselves tested in ways they never thought possible. Loyalties will be challenged and betrayals will be set into motion. In this time of uncertainty, one thing is sure: these two families will never be the same again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cavendon Hall&lt;/i&gt; is Barbara Taylor Bradford at her very best, and its sweeping story of secrets, love, honor, and betrayal will have readers riveted up to the very last page.</description>

  <description>Eleanor of Aquitaine is a 12th century icon who has fascinated readers for 800 years. But the real Eleanor remains elusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stunning novel introduces an Eleanor that all other writers have missed. Based on the most up-to-date research, it is the first novel to show Eleanor beginning her married life at 13. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overflowing with scandal, passion, triumph and tragedy, Eleanor's legendary story begins when her beloved father dies in the summer of 1137, and she is made to marry the young prince Louis of France. A week after the marriage she becomes a queen and her life will change beyond recognition . . .</description>

  &lt;i&gt;'Pay attention please, nurses. The next six months will be the most important of your lives'&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the final year of training for three young nurses at The Nightingale Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helen&lt;/b&gt; is at a crossroads in her life as she battles with her domineering mother over both her love life and her future career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dora&lt;/b&gt; can't stop loving Nick, who is married to her best friend, Ruby. But Ruby is hiding a dark secret with the potential to destroy Ruby's marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millie&lt;/b&gt; is anxious about her fiance, sent to Spain to cover the Civil War, and things only get worse when she encounters a fortune teller who gives her a sinister warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war looming in Europe, and the East End of London squaring up to the threat of Oswald Mosley's blackshirts, the women of the Nightingale have to face their own challenges, at work and in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale Girls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale Sisters&lt;/i&gt;, this is the perfect read for fans of &lt;i&gt;Call the Midwife&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Tristan Wemyss, Earl of Trentham, never expected he'd need to wed within a year or forfeit his inheritance. But he is not one to bow to the matchmaking mamas of the ton. No, he will marry a lady of his own choosing. And the lady he chooses is the enchanting neighbor living with her family next door. Miss Leonora Carling has beauty, spirit and passion; unfortunately, matrimony is the last thing on her mind . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Leonora, Tristan's kisses are oh-so-tempting, but once bitten, forever shy, she has determinedly turned her back on marriage. But Tristan is a seasoned campaigner who will not accept defeat. And when a mysterious man attempts to scare Leonora and her family from their home, Tristan realizes he's been given the perfect excuse to offer his services—as protector, seducer and, ultimately, husband.</description>

  <description>To the student nurses at The Nightingale hospital, the ward sisters are heartless and frightening, with impossibly high standards. But the sisters have troubles of their own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Violet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new night sister is not all that she seems. Who is she and what dark secret is she hiding? As the mystery deepens, Sister Wren is determined to find out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dora&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The student nurse is struggling with her own secret, and with her heartbreak over Nick, the man who got away. A new arrival on the ward brings the chance to put a smile back on her face. But can she really get over Nick so easily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dora's fellow student is also torn between the two men in her life. But then an unexpected friendship with an elderly patient makes her question where her heart - and her future - really lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the nation mourns the death of King George V, it seems as if nothing is ever going to be the same again, especially for the women at the Nightingale.</description>

  <description>The story of a great queen, a woman of enormous courage who made her own rules, and a true survivor. This is the first in a series of early medieval novels by Vanora Bennett, the author of Portrait of an Unknown Woman. Catherine de Valois, daughter of the French king, is born in troubled times. Brought up in a the stormy and unstable environment of the court, her only friend is the remarkable poet and writer Christine de Pizan. Catherine is married off to Henry V as part of a treaty honouring his victory over France, and is destined to be a trophy wife. Terrified at the idea of being married to a man who is at once a foreigner, an enemy and a rough soldier, Catherine nevertheless does her duty. Within two years she is widowed, and mother of the future King of England and France - even though her brother has already claimed the French crown for himself. Caught between warring factions, Catherine finds support from Owain Tudor, controller of her household - a dangerous support as rumours of their relationship would jeopardise her right to keep her child. To save her son, and herself, she must turn away from her love and all that is familiar and safe to find another way forward.</description>

  <description>John Haldane, Earl of Strathairn, is on an urgent mission to find the killer of his fellow spy. After visiting the young widow of one of his agents, Strathairn strengthens his resolve. A spy should never marry, and most certainly not to Lady Sibella Winborne, with her romantic ideas of love and marriage. Unable to give Sibella up entirely, he has kept her close as a friend. Then, weak fool that he is, he kissed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Sibella Winborne has refused several offers of marriage since she first set eyes on the handsome Earl of Strathairn. Sibella’s many siblings always rush to her aid to discourage an ardent suitor, but not this time. Her elder brother, Chaloner, Marquess of Brandreth, has approved Lord Coombe’s suit. Sibella yearns to set up her own household. She is known to be the sensible member of the family, but she doesn’t feel at all sensible about Lord Strathairn. If only she could forget that kiss.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Girl With a Pearl Earring&lt;/i&gt; Tracy Chevalier makes her first fictional foray into the American past in &lt;i&gt;The Last Runaway&lt;/i&gt;, bringing to life the Underground Railroad and illuminating the principles, passions and realities that fueled this extraordinary freedom movement. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New York Times bestselling author Tracy Chevalier’s newest historical saga, she introduces Honor Bright, a modest English Quaker who moves to Ohio in 1850, only to find herself alienated and alone in a strange land. Sick from the moment she leaves England, and fleeing personal disappointment, she is forced by family tragedy to rely on strangers in a harsh, unfamiliar landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteenth-century America is practical, precarious, and unsentimental, and scarred by the continuing injustice of slavery. In her new home Honor discovers that principles count for little, even within a religious community meant to be committed to human equality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, drawn into the clandestine activities of the Underground Railroad, a network helping runaway slaves escape to freedom, Honor befriends two surprising women who embody the remarkable power of defiance. Eventually she must decide if she too can act on what she believes in, whatever the personal costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful journey brimming with color and drama, The Last Runaway is Tracy Chevalier’s vivid engagement with an iconic part of American history.</description>

  <description>While she is travelling north to find sanctuary from the malicious gossip of the Ton, Lady Isabella Wormsley’s room in a Dalkeith inn is invaded by handsome Scottish Laird, Charles Lindsay. Charles has uncovered a plot to kidnap her, but Bella wonders if he isn’t a more dangerous threat, at least to her heart, than the villainous Graham Direlton he wrests her from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella settles into the household of her Aunt Hatty Menzies in Edinburgh’s nineteenth century George Square where Charles is a regular visitor. She has been exiled to the north by her unfeeling mama, but feels more betrayed by her papa to whom she has been close. Bella hopes the delivery of her young cousin’s baby will eventually demonstrate her own innocence in the scandal that drove her from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella’s presence disrupts the lives of everyone connected to her. Direlton makes another attempt to kidnap her and in rescuing her a second time, Charles is compromised. Only a betrothal will save his business and Bella’s reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayhem, murder and long suppressed family secrets raise confusion and seemingly endless difficulties. Will the growing but unacknowledged love between Bella and her Scottish architect survive the evil Direlton engineers?</description>

  <description>Margaret Mitchell's monumental epic of the South won a Pulitzer Prize, gave rise to the most popular motion picture of our time, and inspired a sequel that became the fastest selling novel of the century. It is one of the most popular books ever written: more than 28 million copies of the book have been sold in more than 37 countries. Today, more than 60 years after its initial publication, its achievements are unparalleled, and it remains the most revered American saga and the most beloved work by an American writer...&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>King Henry V - the great Lion of England - is long dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1437, after years of regency, the pious and gentle Henry VI, the Lamb, comes of age and accedes to the English throne. His poor health and frailty of mind render him a weakling king -Henry depends on his closest men, Spymaster Derry Brewer and William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, to run his kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there are those, such as the Plantagenet Richard, Duke of York, who believe England must be led by a strong king if she is to survive. With England's territories in France under threat, and rumours of revolt at home, fears grow that Henry and his advisers will see the country slide into ruin. With a secret deal struck for Henry to marry a young French noblewoman, Margaret of Anjou, those fears become all too real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As storm clouds gather over England, King Henry and his supporters find themselves besieged abroad and at home. Who, or what can save the kingdom before it is too late?</description>

  <description>Sophie Apperly's family has never taken her seriously. Fiercely academic, they see her more practical skills as frivolous whilst constantly taking advantage of her. So when her best friend Milly invites her over to New York, she jumps at the chance. It'll do her ungrateful family good to do without her for a while. What s more, she's on a quest America holds the key to solving her family's financial woes, even if they don't deserve her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Sophie hits the bright lights of Manhattan she's determined to enjoy every minute of her big adventure. So when an evening at an art gallery throws her into the path of Matilda, a spirited old lady who invites her to Connecticut for Thanksgiving, Sophie willingly accepts, much to the dismay of Matilda's grandson Luke. Undeniably attractive but infuriatingly arrogant, he is very protective of his grandmother and seems to doubt Sophie's motives for befriending her. No match for the formidable Matilda, he eventually admits defeat, but first he has a proposal to make. He'll help Sophie in her quest to save her family from financial ruin if she repays the favour. But just what does she have to do in return...?</description>

  <description>Widower Connor Maguire advertises for a wife to raise his young daughter, Bridget, work the homestead and bear him a son. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen O’Sullivan longs for a home, a husband and a family. On paper, she is everything Connor needs in a wife. However, it soon becomes clear that Ellen has not been entirely truthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Connor be able to overlook Ellen’s dishonesty and keep to his side of the bargain? Or will Bridget’s resentment, the attentions of the beautiful Miss Quinn, and the arrival of an unwelcome visitor, combine to prevent the couple from starting anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their personal feelings blur the boundaries of their deal, they begin to wonder if a bargain struck makes a marriage worth keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Wyoming in 1887, a story of a man and a woman brought together through need, not love …</description>

  <description>In Mary Balogh's engaging and seductive new novel of drama and romance, a woman comfortable in her solitude allows temptation to free her heart, when a daring war hero shows her how truly extraordinary she is. &lt;br /&gt;THE PROPOSAL &lt;br /&gt; Gwendoline, Lady Muir, has seen her share of tragedy, especially since a freak accident took her husband much too soon. Content in a quiet life with friends and family, the young widow has no desire to marry again. But when Hugo, Lord Trentham, scoops her up in his arms after a fall, she feels a sensation that both shocks and emboldens her. &lt;br /&gt; Hugo never intends to kiss Lady Muir, and frankly, he judges her to be a spoiled, frivolous--if beautiful--aristocrat. He is a gentleman in name only: a soldier whose bravery earned him a title; a merchant's son who inherited his wealth. He is happiest when working the land, but duty and title now demand that he finds a wife. He doesn't wish to court Lady Muir, nor have any role in the society games her kind thrives upon. Yet Hugo has never craved a woman more; Gwen's guileless manner, infectious laugh, and lovely face have ruined him for any other woman. He wants her, but will she have him? &lt;br /&gt; The hard, dour ex-military officer who so gently carried Gwen to safety is a man who needs a lesson in winning a woman's heart. Despite her cautious nature, Gwen cannot ignore the attraction. As their two vastly different worlds come together, both will be challenged in unforeseen ways. But through courtship and seduction, Gwen soon finds that with each kiss, and with every caress, she cannot resist Hugo's devotion, his desire, his love, and the promise of forever.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The story of one Englishwoman’s remarkable relationship with an Indian princess at the height of the British Empire . . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;India&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, 1849&lt;/i&gt;. When Emma Hammond is left penniless in India after her husband is murdered by thieves, little does she know that she will soon be residing in one of the richest palaces in the country. Just six years earlier, back in England, Emma was implicated in the death of a housekeeper and sentenced to ten years exile in India. Now, unable to return home, she sits before Manikarnika, known to her intimates as Manu, who has promised her vast wealth – if she can teach the wild young girl how to behave like a princess . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love is in the air. A wonderfully romantic novel from the No. 1 &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Recipe for Love, A French Affair &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Perfect Match.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If May, Sally and Harriet didn't need the money so badly, they definitely wouldn't be working for Slimeball Slater at Quality Cleaners. So when they discover it's Slimeball taking &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; to the cleaners, they decide to set up their own business - and that's when things really start to take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working for themselves gives them the freedom and independence they've been longing for. May can afford the mooring fees for her beloved narrowboat; Harriet discovers a true gift for painting and Sally's dream of a place of her own is fast becoming reality. But is it too much, having made such a success of their working lives, to expect similar success in their romantic ones?</description>

  <description>The war is now over and people must count the cost. Three women from very different backgrounds meet when they find themselves on Bristol Temple Meads station waiting for the return of their loved ones. Edna's fiance , Colin, comes home crippled. Charlotte's doctor husband, who was a loving and gentle father, returns a violent, disturbed man with no love for her and even less for their children. Polly, who is waiting for her GI boyfriend Aaron, is once again disappointed when he doesn't arrive. Adjusting to men who are very changed and, in Polly's case, to no man at all, is the core of this enthralling novel. However, during the war years, the women have had to cope. They too have changed and they harbour secrets that would be best kept.</description>

  <description>ROYALIST REBEL is the story of Elizabeth Murray, later Countess Dysart, during the English Civil War; a passionate, determined young woman dedicated to Ham House, the Royalist cause and the three men in her life; her father William Murray, son of a minister who rose to become friend and confidant to King Charles I, the wealthy baronet Lionel Tollemache, her husband of twenty years and John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale, a favourite of Charles II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her father in Oxford at the exiled court of King Charles I, the five Murray women have to cope alone. Crippled by fines for their Royalist sympathies, and besieged by the Surrey Sequestration Committee, Elizabeth must find a rich, apolitical husband to save herself, her sisters, and their inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intelligent, witty and beautiful, Elizabeth wasn’t born noble; her family’s fortunes came from her Scottish father’s boyhood friendship with King Charles, but as the heir to Ham House she was always destined for greater things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novel is certain to delight readers who enjoy stories rich in historical detail, charged with the drama of a young woman's choice between duty and love.</description>

  <description>Three very different girls sign up as student nurses in January 1936, while England is still mourning the death of George V. Dora is a tough East Ender, driven by ambition, but also desperate to escape her squalid, overcrowded home and her abusive stepfather. Helen is the quiet one, a mystery to her fellow nurses, avoiding fun, gossip and the limelight. In fact she is in the formidable shadow of her overbearing mother, who dominates every aspect of her life. Can a nursing career free Helen at last? The third of our heroines is naughty, rebellious Millie -- aka Lady Camilla -- an aristocrat on the run from her conventional upper class life. She is doomed to clash over and over again with terrifying Sister Hyde and to get into scrape after scrape especially where men are concerned. This utterly delightful novel brings a London pre-war hospital vividly to life.</description>

  <description>London, 1816. A handsome baron. A faux betrothal. And Horatia's plan to join the London literary set takes a dangerous turn. Now that the war with France has ended, Baron Guy Fortescue arrives in England to claim his inheritance, abandoned over thirty years ago when his father fled to France after killing a man in a duel. When Guy is set upon by footpads in London, a stranger, Lord Strathairn, rescues and befriends him. But while travelling to his country estate, Guy is again attacked. He escapes only to knock himself out on a tree branch. Aspiring poet Horatia Cavendish has taken to riding her father's stallion, "The General", around the countryside of Digswell dressed as a groom. She has become bored of her country life and longs to escape to London to pursue her desire to become part of the London literary set. When she discovers Guy lying unconscious on the road, the two are forced to take shelter for the night in a hunting lodge. After Guy discovers her ruse, a friendship develops between them. Guy suspects his relative, Eustace Fennimore is behind the attacks on his life. He has been ensconced in Rosecroft Hall during the family's exile and will become the heir should Guy die. Horatia refuses to believe her godfather, Eustace, is responsible. But when Guy proposes a faux betrothal to give him more time to discover the truth, she agrees. Secure in the knowledge that his daughter will finally wed, Horatia's father allows her to visit her blue-stocking aunt in London. But Horatia's time spent in London proves to be anything but a literary feast, for a dangerous foe plots Guy's demise. She is determined to keep alive her handsome fiance, who has proven more than willing to play the part of her lover even as he resists her attempts to save him.</description>

  <description>Please note this edition has been republished by BooksWeLove Inc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in 1706 in England during Queen Anne Stuart’s reign, Far Beyond Rubies begins when William, Baron Kemp, Juliana’s half-brother, claims she and her young sister, Henrietta, are bastards. Spirited Juliana is determined to prove the allegation is false, and that she is the rightful heiress to Riverside, a great estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On his way to deliver a letter to William, Gervaise Seymour sees Juliana for the first time on the grounds of her family home. The sight of her draws him back to India. When “her form changed to one he knew intimately—but not in this lifetime,” Gervaise knows he would do everything in his power to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Juliana and Gervaise are attracted to each other, they have not been formally introduced and assume they will never meet again. However, when Juliana flees from home, and is on her way to London, she encounters quixotic Gervaise at an inn. Circumstances force Juliana to accept his kind help. After Juliana’s life becomes irrevocably tangled with his, she discovers all is not as it seems. Yet, she cannot believe ill of him for, despite his exotic background, he behaves with scrupulous propriety, while trying to help her find evidence to prove she and her sister are legitimate.</description>

  <description>When the British Empire sets its sights on India in the 1850s, it expects a quick and easy conquest. After all, India is not even a country, but a collection of kingdoms on the subcontinent. But when the British arrive in the Kingdom of Jhansi, expecting its queen to forfeit her crown, they are met with a surprise. Instead of surrendering, Queen Lakshmi raises two armies—one male, one female—and rides into battle like Joan of Arc. Although her soldiers are little match against superior British weaponry and training, Lakshmi fights against an empire determined to take away the land she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from the perspective of Sita, one of the guards in Lakshmi's all-female army and the queen’s most trusted warrior, &lt;i&gt;The Last Queen of India&lt;/i&gt; traces the astonishing tale of a fearless ruler making her way in a world dominated by men. In the tradition of her bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Nefertiti&lt;/i&gt;, which Diana Gabaldon, author of the &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt; series, called “a heroic story with a very human heart,” Michelle Moran once again brings a time and place rarely explored in historical fiction to rich, vibrant life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times-&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lionheart&lt;/i&gt; comes the dramatic sequel, telling of the last dangerous years of Richard, Coeur de Lion’s life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This long-anticipated sequel to the national bestseller &lt;i&gt;Lionheart &lt;/i&gt;is a vivid and heart-wrenching story of the last event-filled years in the life of Richard, Coeur de Lion. Taken captive by the Holy Roman Emperor while en route home—in violation of the papal decree protecting all crusaders—he was to spend fifteen months chained in a dungeon while Eleanor of Aquitaine moved heaven and earth to raise the exorbitant ransom. But a further humiliation awaited him: he was forced to kneel and swear fealty to his bitter enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the five years remaining to him, betrayals, intrigues, wars, and illness were ever present. So were his infidelities, perhaps a pattern set by his father’s faithlessness to Eleanor. But the courage, compassion, and intelligence of this warrior king became the stuff of legend, and &lt;i&gt;A King’s Ransom &lt;/i&gt;brings the man and his world fully and powerfully alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its immediate success in 1813, &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of &lt;i&gt;Persuasion&lt;/i&gt; will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.</description>

  <description>When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;North and South&lt;/i&gt;, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.</description>

  <description>The adventures of Laura Ingalls and her family continue as they leave their little house on the prairie and travel in their covered wagon to Minnesota. They settle into a house made of sod on the banks of beautiful Plum Creek. Soon Pa builds them a sturdier house, with real glass windows and a hinged door. Laura and Mary go to school, help with the chores around the house, and fish in the creek. Pa’s fiddle lulls them all to sleep at the end of the day. But then disaster strikes—on top of a terrible blizzard, a grasshopper infestation devours their wheat crop. Now the family must work harder than ever to overcome these challenges.</description>
