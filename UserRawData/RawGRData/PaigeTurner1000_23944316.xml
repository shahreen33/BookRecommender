  <description>Caleb Masterson is, by all accounts, a successful adult. He graduated college, found a job he loves, and has a place to call home. Unfortunately, he knows what he desires in a relationship is considered too “high-maintenance” for most men and he has decided to not even bother looking. He’s happy with his decision until a sexy man with salt-and-pepper hair limps into his physical therapy office and turns his world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful attention to detail and a need to be in control have helped Travis Barton become the owner of a successful construction company. But that same desire for control is what has pushed his past boyfriends away... Travis knows what he’s looking for in a relationship isn’t easy to find, and the last place he expects to find the man with the potential to be everything he’s ever hoped for is in his physical therapist’s office. But when Travis overhears an intriguing conversation between his cute physical therapist and a co-worker, he’s suddenly not so anxious to be back at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible for two men, both content in their lives, to find what they’ve both needed in a partner in the most unexpected of places? Or will their desires be too much for the other to handle?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Conor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a drunken text pic. The kind I would normally never send. Only, instead of it going to the flirty hotel bartender, it goes to some random stranger who actually responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell myself an unexpected night of hot as hell back-and-forth is the perfect way to blow off a little steam while I’m in New York closing an important business deal. Little do I know the man on the other end of the line is none other than Wells Grange: the most controlling, egotistical, emotionless SOB I’ve ever met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend my days squaring off against Wells in the boardroom, and my nights succumbing to the sexy stranger’s commanding texts in the bedroom. Within days, I’m falling for someone I shouldn’t, and I have to remind myself that none of this is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I notice about Conor Newell when he sits down in my high-rise conference room is how delightfully nervous he is. Then I see his tie. The same geeky tie that’s held hostage on my phone. The one that belongs to my anonymous late-night texter. And it changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should confess. Tell the truth about who I am. Instead, I decide there’s no harm in flirting. After all, once our business is concluded, he’ll be out of my life for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I get to know Conor, however, the more I start to fall for him. Which is a problem, because I made a vow long ago to never let emotions interfere with my life, either business or personal. Except I can’t stop thinking about him night and day. If it’s only in my head, though, it doesn’t count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, it’s not like we’re falling for each other in real life...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Hot on the ice and tall in the saddle...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rancher and hockey coach Logan Rivers' attempts to hire a housekeeper are hindered by women more interested in marriage than meal-planning. So when snarky Harper Evans arrives with zero romantic interest in him, he couldn't be happier. But as he gets to know her, he finds himself hungering for more than her cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down-on-her-luck single mom Harper Evans came to Colorado with one goal: to find her son and bring him home. Temporary work for a local rancher seems perfect, but to keep the job she has to deny her feelings for the hot cowboy who's heating up her kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan's secret learning disability has caused a financial mistake that could cost him everything. With the holidays approaching and a storm closing in, he and Harper have to save his ranch and fight for her son. But can Harper trust the cowboy who is offering her both a home--and his heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cowboys of Creedence series: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caught Up in a Cowboy (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt; You Had Me at Cowboy (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt; It Started With a Cowboy (Book 3)&lt;br /&gt;Wish Upon a Cowboy (Book 4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Jennie Marts: &lt;br /&gt; "Readers will cherish the scorching sex, snappy dialogue, well-paced plot, and small Colorado town setting." --&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;em&gt;You Had Me at Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Funny, complicated, and irresistible." --&lt;strong&gt;JODI THOMAS&lt;/strong&gt;, New York Times bestselling author fo&lt;em&gt;r Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Full of exquisite heat and passion...wonderful." --&lt;em&gt;Harlequin Junkie&lt;/em&gt; for&lt;em&gt; Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The brilliant but brooding new doctor encounters Copper Point's sunny nurse-next-door... and nothing can stand in the way of this romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Hong-Wei Wu has come to Copper Point, Wisconsin, after the pressures of a high-powered residency burned him out of his career before he started. Ashamed of letting his family down after all they’ve done for him, he plans to live a quiet life as a simple surgeon in this tiny northern town. His plans, however, don’t include his outgoing, kind, and attractive surgical nurse, Simon Lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon wasn’t ready for the new surgeon to be a handsome charmer who keeps asking him for help getting settled and who woos him with amazing Taiwanese dishes. There’s no question—Dr. Wu is flirting with him, and Simon is flirting back. The problem is, St. Ann’s has a strict no-dating policy between staff, which means their romance is off the table… unless they bend the rules. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a romance that keeps them—literally—in the closet can’t lead to happy ever after. Simon doesn’t want to stay a secret, and Hong-Wei doesn’t want to keep himself removed from life, not anymore. To secure their happiness, they’ll have to change the administration’s mind. But what other secrets will they uncover along the way, about Copper Point… and about each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Safe. Loved. Protected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a single mom, my son was my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I gave birth to Anthony when I was just a scared teenager, my fate was sealed. I knew that I would do anything; sacrifice anything, to make him feel the love I'd never had. And most days, I was pretty sure I succeeded. Life hadn't always been easy. In fact, it pretty much never was. But that was fine. I had Anthony, and he had me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was determined that he would always feel safe, loved, and cared for, even if that meant I would be alone.... I knew that the only person my son and I could depend on was the person I saw in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day I met Cole Carson. And everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passion. Love. Commitment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Quarterback of the Los Angeles Legends, football was my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I picked up a football as a scrawny preteen, my fate was sealed. I knew that I would do anything; sacrifice anything to make my dreams come true. And I succeeded. I was considered a legend, on and off the field. Professionally, I was at the top of my game thanks to my passion and love for it. Personally, the closest to a commitment I ever wanted to make was signing the lease on my hook-up apartment, around the corner from my favorite pick-up bar. And that was month-to-month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't cut out for love, not in the romantic sense ... I knew that my first and only love would be football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the minute I saw Julianna Perez. And my world turned upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author's Note:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Playing with Attraction was originally written for Carly Phillips Dare to Love Kindle World and released as the novella Daring Attraction. We've revised, rewritten (including changing the POV), revamped, and expanded the story to a full-length novel. It is now book one in our first ever sports series. It was SO FUN revisiting this story and updating it! Cole Carson is one of our FAVORITE heroes, we think he is majorly swoon-worthy and we're so happy that his story is back and better than ever!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Logan is out of options.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His mother's new husband is awful, he can't find a paying job, and he's run out of couches to surf on. Desperate, he ends up in the unlikely position of standing on his ex-stepfather's porch holding all his worldly belongings in two cardboard boxes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craig is sure taking Logan in is a terrible idea.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's been six years since he's seen his ex-wife's kid, and Craig hasn't forgotten the trouble the boy caused him. But it's cold out and Logan is clearly at the end of his rope. Craig decides in a fit of charity to help Logan get back on his feet. All he has to do is obey the rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules are meant to be broken.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take one desperate Millennial and one bored Gen Xer. Add in an old grudge, guilt, unwelcome feelings, an inconvenient interest in Daddy kink, a need for discipline and regular meals, and punishment for rule-breaking. Shake well. Expect explosive results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rule Forty-Seven is a stand-alone 11k short with a May/December romance, sexy-fun times, snark, and a HEA.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s got moves on — and off — the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As receiver for the Miami Storm, Grady Murdock couldn’t be more satisfied with his professional life. Next up—his personal one. He’s a player on the field, not off, so when he claps eyes on Melinda at a Storm event, he’s neither surprised nor alarmed to find she triggers both lustful and long-term thoughts. Six years his senior, Mel isn’t so easily convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent, career-minded Melinda Shaw has singlehandedly built one of Miami’s premier event-management companies, but success hasn’t stopped her heart from shifting its focus to marriage and children. Still, she’s not about to burden a younger man with her fantasies of familial grandeur…until she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their combustible sexual chemistry notwithstanding, Grady still has to work overtime to convince Mel he wants her despite their impending parenthood, not because of it. It’ll take almost losing everything—and more than a few of Grady’s famous moves—to score Mel’s heart once and for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This title was previously published as His Daring Mistake. It has been extensively revised and lengthened.</description>

  <description>Journey back to Neverland, NC with NYT &amp;amp; USA Today Bestselling Author Gina L. Maxwell as she turns your favorite villain into the hero you never knew you needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THEY CALL ME HOOK &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m Captain of the Pirates; a villain by design and a loner by nature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t need anyone. More than that, I don’t want anyone. Especially Officer John Darling who insists on seeing the good in everything, including me. If there was ever any good inside of me, it was snuffed out long ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve avoided him for years, but now I need his help to save my brother’s life and take down Fred Croc, the monster from my childhood and my current employer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Darling is undercover in my crew, living in my loft and forever working out shirtless. Taking Croc’s operation down from the inside is dangerous as hell, but Darling’s probing gaze and the natural way he defers to my dominant side might just be the end of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I’ve lived in the dark for too long, and no amount of light can save me. Not even one as bright as Johnathan Darling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HE CALLS ME DARLING &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a Task Force Officer with the FBI; a protector of the innocent and a man in love with a villain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before I was even old enough to understand it, I had a crush on the broody teen called Captain Hook, following him around like a puppy and hoping he’d show me the slightest bit of attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He never did, though, not for years. Not until I became his only viable option for getting his crew member back and throwing Croc behind bars. Now he can’t ignore me, and he can’t hide the desire burning in his eyes when I sink to my knees, eager to serve my Captain however he needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But secrets are hard to keep in close quarters, and when I discover the darkness lurking in his past, eradicating the evil in Neverland is no longer my only mission. Come hell or high water, I’ll make Hook see that he’s never been the villain of this story…he’s the hero. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Trigger Warning for readers sensitive to characters with sexual assault in their pasts. Please read the Author’s Note in the beginning of the book for more details. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the This Man series comes a sexy and emotional follow up to her wildly popular standalone romance &lt;i&gt;The Protector&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Willis has spent years in the protection business, a job that requires constant vigilance and quick thinking. His only chance to truly relax is at his secluded cabin in a small town where there are never any surprises. So when Ryan returns after an assignment and encounters a beautiful stranger, he isn't only surprised, he's also instantly intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Bright is a breath of fresh air, and Ryan is soon completely consumed, unable to stop from falling for her. As the two grow closer, his instinct tells him something is amiss. Yet nothing could prepare him for what he discovers when he starts digging into her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah spends her days painting, running her arts and crafts store...and hiding too many secrets. It's why she won't let the ruggedly handsome bodyguard get too close. But their chemistry is undeniable, and Hannah quickly finds herself caught up in a whirlwind romance with Ryan. He is peace personified, a balm to her battered soul. Yet the gorgeous, captivating man who has swept Hannah off her feet doesn't even know who she really is. And the moment he finds out, both their lives are at risk.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Clean Slate Ranch: home of tight jeans, cowboy boots and rough trails. For some men, it’s a fantasy come true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Matthews never imagined he’d be living out of his car, trying to make ends meet, but life doesn’t always go your way—he knows that better than most. When an accident leaves the Clean Slate Ranch shorthanded, Shawn is enlisted to help cook and finds himself bunked next to the sexiest cowboy he’s ever laid eyes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time Robin Butler spots the new chef, he thinks he’s seeing an actual ghost. Shawn is the spitting image of his late husband, and it spooks the hell out of him. The former rodeo-star-turned-ranch-hand does his best to avoid the soft-spoken cook—except it’s kind of tough when the man makes the best damn grub this side of the Mississippi &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has a boy-next-door charm that’s impossible to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the tension between them practically sizzles, Shawn doesn’t do hookups and Robin isn’t ready for a new relationship. Besides, Robin can tell Shawn’s been hurt and deserves a partner who isn’t saddled with a tragic past. But chemistry doesn’t lie. Maybe finding each other—and a second chance at love—is the lucky break they both need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the Carina Press Romance Promise: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 99,000 words</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ollie never expected to meet his Daddy in the baby aisle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All Oliver wanted was some more paint, a new box of crayons, and a maybe some more candy. Scared of putting himself and his needs out there in fear of rejection, Oliver never expected to meet eyes with the Daddy of his dreams. He definitely didn’t expect the man to hunt him down in the store and ask him out while standing in the baby aisle holding a basket with a bottle of his favorite strawberry bubble bath, a new yellow sippy cup, and an awesome dinosaur coloring book. He might as well have the word ‘little’ stamped permanently across his forehead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marshall never expected to be anyone’s Daddy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While enjoying his coffee and reading a book, Marshall never expected to feel someone watching him and he definitely didn’t expect to meet the eyes of a beautiful man that pushed every one of his buttons but in a second he was gone. Unwilling to let him slip out of his grasp, Marshall searches everywhere and when he finds him in the baby aisle perusing the pacifiers, he boldly approaches. Once he realizes Oliver is a little in every sense of the word and is in need of a Daddy to love and care for him, Marshall finally succumbs to the desires he’s suppressed for so long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow Oliver and Marshall on their sweet journey of discovery and acceptance as they both reach for the connection they never thought they would find.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR CONFESSION: Okay, confession time! In my excitement to push the publish button, I uploaded an older, unedited version of this book. It might have taken me a couple of days to notice but I’ve since realized my mistake and have uploaded the edited version of Caring For Little Ollie. Most of the edits were spelling errors and problems with tenses, nothing about the plot was changed between the copy I uploaded and the edited version. For those of you who read the unedited version, thanks for sticking around through the mess it was and for those who have no idea what I’m talking about, be thankful. That will teach me to be more careful about my file naming conventions. Peace, Izaia Winter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: This book is Intended for Adult (18+) readers. While not all books in this series will feature Age Play, Daddy Kink, or Adult Babie/Diaper Lover elements, this book does. I understand this kind of content is not for everyone and if this is not your cup of tea, feel free to skip this book. I try to write all books so that they can be read and understood as stand alones although reading them all together will create a more complete and rich experience.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~60k words &lt;br /&gt;Story Contains: MM Sexual Content, Daddy Kink, BDSM Elements, Power Exchange Relationships, Age Play, Mild AB/DL, Brief References to Past Child Abuse, Fast Feelings, Sweetness Overload, Happily Ever Afters, and No Angst</description>

  <description>Black Rousseau has honored the code and kept his distance from the one thing in this world that means something to him. But things are about to change. Black’s just received the blessing he’s been waiting for since the moment he set eyes on his boss’ daughter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up in the biker bar her father owned, Roxie Lear dreams of getting out of Hell, Michigan. The only other thing she’s always wanted is Black Rousseau. But he treats her like she doesn’t exist. Until the day her father goes to prison, that is. And Black lets her know what’s been boiling behind his cool indifference all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Black’s preparations to claim Roxie once and for all be too much for her? Will the darkness inside of him frighten away the only thing in this world he’s ever needed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Note:&lt;/b&gt; This alpha is a little dark and a bit brutal but he cherishes what is his. As always, this story is safe/no cheating with the perfect happy ending. Strap on your wrist cuffs and your safe word, this hot quickie of a smutty read will have you questioning your morals and wiggling in your seat.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A badass biker and the sexy little sprite that wants nothing to do with him. &lt;br /&gt;They’re opposites in every way that matters—except one—they can’t keep their eyes off each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer watches Tink strut past him without so much as a glance. His eyes moving over her hot little body—a body that’s been driving him crazy and keeping him awake at night. She’s the one chick he’s been infatuated with for months, but she won’t give him the time of day. &lt;br /&gt;Hammer just doesn’t get it. After all, he’s a big, muscular man who turns female heads wherever he goes. Tattoos cover the skin of his sculpted body, and that combined with being a patched member of the Evil Dead MC does it for most women who are into bad boys. Not Tink, though. Unfortunately for Hammer, the one woman he wants more than any other seems to be immune to him. &lt;br /&gt;Well, he’s had about enough of her snubbing him like he doesn’t even exist. He’s going after what he wants, and what he wants more than anything is that hot little girl with the short white-blonde hair. The one so petite, the guys in the club nicknamed her Tinker Bell. &lt;br /&gt;Yes, that sexy little sprite is going to be his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tink is totally aware of Hammer’s eyes on her as she walks past. Warmth floods her body, like it does every time she’s near him and he looks at her that way—like he’s undressing her with his eyes and imagining all the sordid things he’d like to do to her. Things she lies awake at night imagining as well. &lt;br /&gt;But Tink isn’t willing to risk her heart; not for a man who could hurt her like he could, a man who has already been with her sister. Raven always gets what she wants, and that’s usually anything she thinks Tink might want. &lt;br /&gt;Tink learned long ago not to even try to compete with her sister. It’s pointless. So, she’s carved out a life for herself surrounded by the men of this MC and the women who have become her best friends. It’s a world she thought her sister would never be interested in, and one where she’ll never have to compete with her. &lt;br /&gt;Apparently, she’d thought wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when a badass biker wants the one woman he can’t have? &lt;br /&gt;How far will he go to have her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About Nicole James &lt;br /&gt;Nicole James is a USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling author who loves writing about hot alpha men who'll do anything for the women they love! Her stories are filled with struggle, conflict and real human emotion. She is the author of the Evil Dead MC series, the Brothers Ink Tattoo series and more. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lady Ophelia’s voice is so lovely, so incomparable, she’s permitted to break convention and appear on the London stage. The young ingenue has more admirers than she realizes, but after long years cloistered at a Viennese music school, she has no idea how society’s games of courtship and seduction are played. The Marquess of Wescott is prone to bucking convention too—not always in a good way. He and his friends are frequent subjects of gossip for their rakish behavior, like their regular forays to Pearl’s Emporium, where lovers of discipline explore risqué fantasies in secret rooms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wescott and Ophelia’s fates collide on a dry autumn night, when a fast-moving fire strands them together on the outskirts of London. As the sun rises, they learn convention can only be stretched so far. They’re obliged to wed in a quick, quiet ceremony, and embark upon married life as little more than strangers. From the start, their dueling personalities tangle into knots of frustration and regret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But marriage is marriage, and they must learn to live with one another. Lord Wescott tries to bring his wife into line using the disciplinary tactics he’s honed over the years, but Ophelia’s not so easily tamed. She’s a stubborn soul, determined to resist her husband at every turn. Life is not an opera, and love is not easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Wescott and Ophelia, the battle has only begun… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘Tis the season for starting over for one military man turned cowboy in this new novel by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cowboy and His Baby.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Navy master-at-arms Jason Clements is down on his luck and calling in one last favor. His cousin has secured him a job opportunity as a cowboy working at Price Ranch in Wyoming. Too bad Jason has never even saddled a horse. If he can keep this job without his PTSD getting in the way, it’ll be a Christmas miracle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local busybody Sage Cooper loves Painted Barrel something fierce, but it’s time for her to move on. Since her father passed away, the family ranch feels too big for just her, and there’s no chance of finding a husband in this small town. To the rest of the world, she’s just another local fixture, known for her closet full of ugly Christmas sweaters and being perpetually single. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn’t until Jason shows up in desperate need of a cowboy crash course that Sage discovers a tall, dark, and handsome reason to stick around. And with the holidays coming up, Sage is in need of a date for a special event—maybe they’ll turn out to be each other’s best Christmas present.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Pucked series comes a romantic comedy about instant attraction, second chances, and not-so-little white lies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need an escape from the demands, the puck bunnies, and the notoriety that come with being an NHL team captain. I just want to be a normal guy for a few weeks. So when I leave Chicago for some peace and quiet, the last thing I expect is for a gorgeous woman to literally fall into my lap on a flight to Alaska. Even better, she has absolutely no idea who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lainey is the perfect escape from my life. My plan for seclusion becomes a monthlong sex fest punctuated with domestic bliss. But it ends just as abruptly as it began. When I’m called away on a family emergency, I realize too late that I have no way to contact Lainey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, a chance encounter throws Lainey and me together again. But I still have a lie hanging over my head, and Lainey’s keeping secrets of her own. With more than lust at stake, the truth may be our game changer.</description>

  <description>A gripping, heart-pounding romance from USA Today bestselling author Stacey Kennedy about a former FBI agent who will do anything it takes to protect his ex, or risk losing her for good...&lt;br /&gt;Asher Sullivan was once Remy Brennan's entire world--until he broke her heart into a million pieces. So when Asher crashes her wedding, Remy is certain he's come to claim her. To make her his again. Instead, it turns out Remy's groom is a con man scheming for her inheritance. Now all she's left with is an empty bank account, a serious case of lust for her gorgeous ex...and a duffel bag of cold, hard cash that might just fix all her problems.&lt;br /&gt;Detective Asher Sullivan has always protected Remy. So when dangerous criminals start threatening her, Asher's most primitive instincts take over. Sticking by Remy's side means Asher is finally able to make amends for leaving her all those years ago. And soon they're giving in to their wicked, insatiable need. But just as Asher gets his second chance, a secret Remy is keeping could rip her away from him...forever.</description>

  <description>As the lead vocalist for country music’s hottest band, Derek Edwards knows that coming out as gay could mean the end of his career. With his life in the spotlight and too much on the line, Derek won’t let himself think about finding a boyfriend, much less the Daddy he desperately desires. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sheriff Colt Westfield has better things to do than following Hollywood heartthrobs or the latest singing sensations. So when one drink turns into a mind-blowing one-night stand, he has no idea who he was with. That is, until he’s dragged to a concert and sees his sexy one night stand strutting around on stage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a record label, management team, and fans watching, will they be able to find what they both need? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 69k word novel contains mild BDSM aspects as well as spanking, age play, and ABDL</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of Christina Lauren and Colleen Hoover will love this sexy and emotional fourth book in the New York Times bestselling Dirty Deeds series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the sudden death of his wife, Nathan Bell has spent nearly two years burying himself in work and neglecting his biggest responsibility: his daughter. Overcome with guilt, he wants to connect with little Marley, but he doesn’t know how to do it alone. And then Jenna Savage throws him a lifeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single mom of twins, Jenna is more than capable of taking care of Nate’s adorable two-year-old, and wants to help Nathan however she can. Soon, attachments are made, forcing Jenna and her kids into new territory. And the closer everyone becomes, the more right it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love forces Nathan to face his biggest fear, and when hearts, both big and little, are on the line, the only thing scarier than needing someone is losing them all.</description>

  <description>Who needs 20/20 vision to find true love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something familiar about the gorgeous woman across the crowded club. When he “accidentally” bumps into her, Alex Dean is shocked to discover what it is. The tall, leggy blonde is none other than Sadie Emerson, his college english tutor—and the subject of more fantasies than he could count. Years later, she’s looking better than ever. He has to have her. Tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really matter that she thinks she’s going home with his buddy, Alex Dane?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it does because she sneaks away the morning after. Twice. First, when she discovers her mistake, then when she decides her upcoming move to Winter Lake makes them a two-day stand at best. But the sex is off-the-charts combustible, and Alex is already seeing stars, hearing bells…envisioning houses and picket fences and other things he’d never considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all he has to do is convince Sadie his feelings are real. His shy wallflower might consider him a mistake—but Alex has never been more certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This title was previously published. It has been extensively revised and lengthened.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;These men never back away from danger—and always fall hard for love in &lt;i&gt;Cover Six Security&lt;/i&gt;, an explosive new series from USA Today Bestselling Author Lisa B. Kamps.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gordon "Mac" MacGregor swore an oath to protect and defend—an oath he continues to uphold as a former Army Ranger specializing in dark ops private security with Cover Six Security. Danger is a constant companion—and one of the few things that make him feel alive. He doesn't expect that danger to come in the form of the Tabitha "TR" Meyers, the only woman who sees him for who he truly is—and the only woman he's ever sworn off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TR rarely abides by the rules, not when there's something she needs—and right now, she needs Mac. She enlists his help for one night, thinking she can simply walk away when it's over. But that one night is just the beginning, thrusting both of them into a dangerous web of scandal and cover-up with roots that run deeper than either of them expects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When TR becomes an unwitting pawn in a game of deception and revenge, Mac will do anything to protect her—even if it means risking his own heart. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Blackballed from my job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moved back to my hometown with my tail between my legs and family issues crushing my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slinging drinks in a dive bar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the past year has been hell. So when a man who’s temptation wrapped in golden skin and sin offers me one night of no-holds barred, dirty sex, I’m all in. I deserve it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now those few unforgettable hours have me facing blackmail from my own father: He'll pay for my mom's medical bills, but only if I never again touch the man who has quickly become my obsession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the man? My obsession? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s my stepbrother.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Don’t touch the nanny. It’s one rule I’m most certainly going to break.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since becoming a single father, I have two things that keep me sane—my daughter Lily and playing football for the NFL. But when my meddling sister hires a nanny without my knowledge, I’m not thrilled to come home and find the woman has taken over my house. Our instant attraction is one more complication I don’t need in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my daughter loves Amelia, and I will do anything for that tiny munchkin. Even if it means walking around with blue balls most of the time. Why does the &lt;i&gt;nanny&lt;/i&gt; have to be so sweet—and drop dead gorgeous? She’s driving me crazy. Never in my life have I wanted a woman more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to make it through this season. I can do that. Hands free, of course. But then there’s that moment, and I know she’s thinking what I’m thinking and, well, yeah. Screw the rules...</description>

  <description>Gage Ryan was a notorious heartbreaker, on screen and off. A confirmed bachelor, this world-famous actor dashed the hopes of millions of adoring fans when he rejected marriage and commitment: no wedding bells, no baby carriages. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He'd never had cause to consider the alternative, but that all changed the night he met rising star, Morgan Kelly. Too bad her first impression of him was less than favorable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although their attraction was instant and mutual, Morgan wasn't interested. Hollywood heartthrobs were trouble. Especially Gage, a man used to women who would do anything for his attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not happening. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Gage knew how to go after what he wanted, and his desire for Morgan was stronger than anything he'd ever felt before. Powerful enough to make him reconsider his previously held beliefs on love and longevity. He just had to convince her of how serious he was. It was a good thing he was ready for the chase.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds comes the first novel in the fun, sexy, and thrilling How to Catch an Alpha series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leah Emerson isn’t looking for a man—she’s looking for the right man. But her mother’s idea of a great catch leaves her cold, and she’s pretty sure her cocky, arrogant, and way too good-looking new neighbor isn’t the one either.

He wants her smiles, he wants her touch, and he definitely wants her in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, someone else wants Leah—in the worst way. Now Tyler’s on a mission to protect the woman he’s falling in love with while proving he’s worth falling for, and Leah must decide whether Tyler is a catch worth catching…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Stand-alone Steamy Weekends romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Juliette Pierce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a type-A planner, I lived my life by lists. I thrived off of completing projects. Yet, one task had eluded me. I was still a virgin. With a milestone birthday right around the corner, my status was looming over me like a dark cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, the only man I'd attempted to give my V-card to was going to be staying at the resort I ran and he'd requested that I be his personal concierge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd done my best to forget Romeo Whitehall even existed. That goal was made all the more difficult since he was the drummer of a popular band who frequently graced the tabloids. It had been twelve years since I'd seen my brother's best friend turned rock star and now we'd be spending the weekend alone in a secluded villa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romeo Whitehall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend's little sister was supposed to be off-limits to me. I should have never developed feelings for the copper-haired girl with big brown eyes and smile that could light up Times Square. But then again, I'd never been very good at following the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd loved Juliette Pierce for so long I couldn't remember what not loving her felt like. But I'd screwed everything up. After being MIA for over a decade, I prayed that it wasn't too late to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;One virgin. One rock star. One weekend alone. What could go wrong?&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>All Suzanne St. Michelle wants is an over-the-top, eggnog-induced holiday with her best friend in Credence, Colorado. But when her hoity-toity parents insist she come home for Christmas in New York, she blurts out that her sexy landlord is actually her boyfriend and she can’t leave him—Joshy &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; Christmas. The more twinkle lights the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rancher Joshua Grady does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; love Christmas. Or company, or chatty women. Unfortunately for him, the chattiest woman ever has rented the cottage on his ranch, invited her rich, art-scene parents, and now insists he play “fake rancher boyfriend” in a production of the Hokiest Christmas Ever. And somehow…she gets him to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, he’ll do anything to get his quiet life back. At least there’s mistletoe every two feet—and kissing &lt;i&gt;Suzy&lt;/i&gt; is surprisingly easy. But in the midst of acres of tinsel, far too many tacky Christmas sweaters, and a tree that can be seen from space, he’s starting to want what he lost when he was a kid—a family. Too bad it’s with a woman heading back to New York before the ball drops…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wynn family bonds bend but never break. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;JP Wynn:&lt;/b&gt; I admit, I’ve made some bad choices—on and off the ice.&lt;br /&gt; Now all I want to do is show my team I can control my emotions while I’m playing and redeem myself with my family, especially with my brother, Théo.&lt;br /&gt; I hate that I hurt him and I’m determined to stay out of trouble. &lt;br /&gt; But the hot bridesmaid at Théo’s wedding is tempting me into another bad decision.&lt;br /&gt; A little flirting and a hook up with Taylor seem harmless . . . until Manny Martinez jumps me on the dance floor and starts beating the crap out of me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And just like that I add one more bad decision to my résumé.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Taylor Hart:&lt;/b&gt; I always thought hockey players were hot. Now I think they’re crazy.&lt;br /&gt; Manny broke my heart when he got traded to another team and left without even a goodbye.&lt;br /&gt; Then he showed up at my best friend’s wedding. All I wanted to do was show Manny that I was over him.&lt;br /&gt; And the groom’s sexy brother, JP, seemed more than willing to be my distraction.&lt;br /&gt; But after the way everything went down, I want nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;of them. &lt;br /&gt; Easier said than done. Especially when Lacey’s new brother-in-law is always around. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And I keep thinking about the wedding night, when we snuck away to his room for the best sex of my life.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Alec Sullivan has always believed he has it all. A billion-dollar private aviation business. A penthouse apartment in New York City. Beautiful women who know better than to expect him ever to fall in love. And great siblings for whom he’d do anything. But when Alec's business partner passes away and leaves everything to a daughter Alec never knew about, in an instant everything in his life turns upside down…all because of Cordelia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cordelia always thought she was perfectly happy with her life. She owns a garden store she loves, lives in a pretty little cottage in the same town as her adoptive parents, and figures there’s plenty of time to meet Mr. Right. But she never counted on becoming the surprise heir to a fortune…or on meeting a man like Alec Sullivan. A shockingly sexy billionaire who makes her heart race and melt all at the same time.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither Alec nor Cordelia plans on getting any closer than they have to. Only, how can either of them fight this kind of heat, this depth of desire? And when Cordelia needs Alec’s support, it’s pure instinct for him to be there for her. But when it’s her turn to help him confront his deepest pain, will Alec let her in? Or will he push her away, just as he’s pushed away everyone who's loved him for the past thirty years… </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in a sexy new series featuring the hockey players of the Brooklyn Bruisers and the women who win their hearts—from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Ivy Years series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In high school they were the perfect couple—until the day Georgia left Leo in the cold...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey player Leo Trevi has spent the last six years trying to do two things: get over the girl who broke his heart, and succeed in the NHL. But on the first day he’s called up to the newly franchised Brooklyn Bruisers, Leo gets checked on both sides, first by the team’s coach—who has a long simmering grudge, and then by the Bruisers’ sexy, icy publicist—his former girlfriend Georgia Worthington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying goodbye to Leo was one of the hardest things Georgia ever had to do—and saying hello again isn’t much easier. Georgia is determined to keep their relationship strictly professional, but when a press conference microphone catches Leo declaring his feelings for her, things get really personal, really fast....</description>

  <description>Trevor Thorne has always played it safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a ballplayer. The game has had his heart and soul since he was just a kid. He learned early on that living in the testosterone-fueled world of baseball meant living a lie. He couldn’t afford to be openly gay, not when he had his whole career ahead of him. But his days behind the plate are numbered and he’s tired, so damn tired of hiding who he is, and it’s becoming more and more difficult to deny himself what, and who, he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodrigo Cruz is the opposite of safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s young, ballsy, and bold. Out and proud, Cruz has never shied away from going after what he wants. He wants a career as a big-league ballplayer, and he wants it on his own terms. No hiding his sexuality or his past but also no throwing himself at his beautiful, blue-eyed bunkmate. Not even if he suspects Trevor isn’t quite as straight as he claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing that line, testing that theory, it could put his entire career at risk. If he swings for the fences and strikes out, he’ll always be that guy in the locker room who can’t keep it in his pants. But what if he’s right and they’re more than just teammates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they’re soulmates?</description>

  <description>USA Today bestselling author Stacey Kennedy is back with the thrilling and emotional conclusion of the Dirty Hacker duet about a hacker who doesn’t back down on a case, a sexy CIA agent who is more than a little overprotective, and two slightly reluctant but perfectly matched hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracking a killer is the last thing hacker Alex McCoy expected out of her vacation to New York, but after rekindling her one-time romance with sexy CIA Agent Rowan Hawke, she can’t refuse his request for help. Waiting for a break in the case proves to be more challenging than Alex expected, especially because it gives her too much time to think about her growing feelings for Rowan. Feelings she would much rather write off as the intensely hot chemistry between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowan knows that Alex has a lot of emotional baggage, but every day as they work together, he becomes more certain she’s the woman for him. Unfortunately, Rowan’s instinct to protect her is put to the test when secrets come to light and Alex throws herself in the line of fire to help Rowan solve the case. As Rowan falls deeper for Alex, he must open up about his past and give her the chance to prove that she’s the right partner—in work and in life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lasting connection needs more than simply surviving a winter together—they’ll have to outsmart danger, let down their defenses and open their hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen Han has a fresh lease on life—he’s kicked cancer’s ass and is roaring through his bucket list. The former investment banker hopes to find his next challenge in Alaska, volunteering alongside park rangers and fulfilling his childhood dreams of snowy winters and rustic life. Of course, those dreams did tend to feature big strapping mountain men in vivid detail…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranger Quilleran Ramsey would like to be anywhere other than dealing with newbie volunteers. And really, the only thing he needs less than a green volunteer “partner” is the flirty attentions of a buff city boy who doesn’t look ready to last a week, let alone an Alaskan winter. They’re all wrong for each other, even if Quill’s traitorous body enjoys the flirting more than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weeks pass, the two snowbound men give in to temptation. But can their seasonal romance last until spring? For them to have a future together, each will have to trust the other…while hoping that the harsh elements and omnipresent dangers don’t destroy what happiness they’ve found in the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise: &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>From USA Today bestselling author comes a brand new romantic suspense duet, featuring a brilliant hacker with trust issues bigger than the deep web, a CIA agent who loves a challenge, and enough heat between the two of them to melt your hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, hacker Alex McCoy had a hot-as-hell week in Paris with a CIA agent she was teamed up with, before a final night that neither of them would call their finest hour. Now, Alex's life is spent hunting down classified information behind her screen and working too many hours to count. She's miles past burnout and has decided to escape to New York City for a much-needed vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CIA Agent Rowan Hawke never thought he'd see Alex again after his "midnight tiptoe" on their last evening together in Paris. But his sister has been abducted and he's desperate for the help of the best hacker he's ever met, especially when he finds out she's in New York. Hoping to use all his previous skills of seduction to get her assistance, Rowan isn't prepared for the immediate sizzle that springs back to life between them. Lost in the moment, he takes what he wants--Alex's lush body bending to his will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the lust is sedated between them and he admits he purposely scouted her to help him find his sister, he'll need more than charm to win over the mistrustful hacker. He'll need the truth. As the case becomes increasingly dangerous, the stakes ratchet up alongside the heat between Rowan and Alex. But when Alex discovers a link between the killer and the FBI, she must decide if she can trust Rowan to protect her or if he's the man her heart needs protection from.</description>

  <description>A Once Upon a Vegas Night Tale &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His greatest prize can’t be won in the octagon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champion MMA fighter Adam Littrell needs no distractions as he prepares for the fight that will determine whether he retires. But when he opens the door of his swanky Las Vegas home to his new personal assistant, Bo Wilkins, staying focused becomes a struggle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aware of Adam’s surly reputation, Bo doesn't expect to like his new employer, let alone fall for him. But Bo is pleasantly surprised when a shared love of books leads them to study for their GEDs together and plan for a life after their current careers. Adam won't be able to fight forever, and Bo wants a relationship on equal footing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just as their relationship is getting off the ground, the sister Bo raised needs his help, and he drops everything. With Adam’s final match looming and Bo in a different city, reuniting will be the real challenge.</description>

  <description>Rancher and single father Tripp Montgomery is a master at French braiding and princess tea parties. He's also the most eligible bachelor in Cheyenne, Wyoming. So when he stumbles upon a flashy, sexy city girl, he knows two things: 1) she's a walking disaster, and 2) he needs to stay far, far away. &lt;p&gt;But she needs him more than he wants to admit…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Gram knows what it's like not to be wanted. She's in Cheyenne for the summer to help her grandmother heal after surgery, but the farmhouse "chores" are proving much harder than she thought. If her day couldn't get any worse, the sexiest man she's ever seen strolls up to save the day...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...and he &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; doesn't seem happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>A cute cowboy story</strong><br /><br />This was a short cute cowboy book. The characters were sweet and it held a little drama to keep the story moving. <br />I liked Tripp and Charlotte. Despite being opposites they worked. Gracie, Tripp's daughter was adorable too. I'm hoping Cash and Bo get their story next! ]]>

  <description>Marshall Dyson wants one thing and one thing only: to raze his grandfather’s island to the ground. Everything is ready to go––except for the freakin’ bunnies! Hundreds of the furry critters hopping about and multiplying before his eyes. And then there’s the American Bunny League, along with one distractingly beautiful veterinarian, taking him to court to save them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Augusta “Gus” North can’t believe the grumpy–and annoyingly hot–builder she’s facing in court cares more about demo-ing some cabin than the lives of 200 bunnies. But when the judge orders Marshall to stay on the island and help her rehome the rabbits – the entire month – she knows they’re going to need to lay some ground rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, for example, absolutely no kissing. Might as well go ahead and get that in writing. Sure it’s on a napkin, but that still counts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard could it be to keep their hands off each other amidst all the fighting? Surprisingly, harder than wrangling 200 bunnies...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A forgotten era&lt;br /&gt;A forever love&lt;br /&gt;Their untold story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Screw the rules.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Army veteran Richie Tallin returns to South Dakota from a disastrous war with nothing to gain and nothing to lose. With no real home, his family in shambles, his dad’s old motorcycle becomes the key to a new life as Wreck, the Road Captain of an outlaw motorcycle club. Now he’s living the life he’s always craved—freedom, good times, loyalty, no regrets, and, hell yes, no rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he finally gets a chance with Isi, a feisty girl he’s had his eye on for years, everything shifts. As fiercely independent as Wreck, Isi is determined to restart her life and keep her family’s business afloat while she hides a wounded past. She and Wreck light a fire in each other that’s unexpected and wild, and what begins as a casual fling becomes passionate and serious real fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a war of revenge, payback, and power breaks out, everyone gets caught in the crossfire. Choices are made. Sacrifices that can never be undone. In a crazy 80’s world of drug dealers, rock and rollers, and rival outlaws, Wreck and Isi are determined to hold on come what may.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And come it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few know how the One-Eyed Jacks MC of Meager came to be. And fewer still, how the love of one woman changed the destiny of a small town in the Black Hills of South Dakota forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;“The Dust and the Roar” is the origin story of the Lock &amp;amp; Key Series set in the late 1970s through the 1980s before the timeline of the series. This is a literary fiction love story of Isi and original MC member, Wreck, as well as the story of the founding of the club in Meager, South Dakota. It is a full length, complete novel and can be read as a standalone before or after the series.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Stand-alone Steamy Weekends romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cinderella "CiCi" Howard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have just received my freshly-minted divorce papers, but for the last decade I've been a single mom for all intents and purposes. Spending the weekend at Oasis Hot Springs Resort and Spa as the maid of honor at my best friend's wedding, I'm not on "mom duty." I'm not on "wife duty"--and never will be again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I meet a bartender whose smile warms me up faster than a shot of whiskey, I decide to embrace my singledom and check one-night-stand off my bucket list. One night, no strings, what could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam "Sully" Sullivan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some hard and fast rules for business. The first and most important is: No sleeping with the guests. When you own and operate three resorts and big plans to keep expanding your empire, there's no wiggle room there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I meet the most stunning woman I've ever laid eyes on while filling in for the resort's bartender, my rules go out the window. She wants one night, no strings, it's any man's dream scenario...but I'm not any man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For CiCi and Liam, is a one night stand just the beginning or a night they'll both regret?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It was just supposed to be a one-night stand— Until he stole her life story and put it in a song. &lt;br /&gt;Now he’s rock’s hottest new artist— And she’s just found out she’s having his baby. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rory is a pierced and inked tattoo artist by day at Brothers Ink, but by night he’s lead guitarist for the heavy metal rock band, Convicted Chrome. He’s headed East on his Harley to catch up with the tour. Beautiful Rayne is headed West on her motorcycle with her girl squad…the Moto Babes. When rain forces them all to take refuge in the same motel, sparks fly. A night of drinking and karaoke leads to a connection deeper than either of them expects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Rayne&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; — What do you do when someone writes a song about your most private feelings and experiences and you hear it on the radio for the first time? What do you do when that song is climbing the charts, and the man who stole your life story is suddenly rock’s hottest new artist? What do you do when you find out you’re having his baby? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Rory&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; — After a long songwriting drought, he’s met a woman who sparked something in him and got his creative juices flowing. He’s written one of his best songs ever. When a friend in the business gives him the break of a lifetime he’s suddenly topping the charts. But Rory’s not ready for the instant stratosphere of success he’s catapulted into. Caught up in a whirlwind career that offers temptations and sin at every turn, is Rory losing the biggest part of himself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix his career and more importantly himself, he’ll have to go back and fix the damage he’s done and apologize to the people he’s wronged in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And one person in particular tops that list. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Total control. I need it in every aspect of my life. Some would say that makes me an asshole. A freak. But as long as everything’s exactly how I want it, I’m completely flexible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay, I’m not kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lacey needs someone in her life who’s bigger and scarier than her demons, and she wants that man to be me. Her boss. The Viking in a suit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope she understands what she’s getting into. This daddy isn’t going to pat her on the head and tell her she’s a good girl for nothing. Especially not when she’s spinning out of control.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lorelei James returns for another wild ride in Wyoming with a new Blacktop Cowboys(R) novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the Army equipped Bailey Masterson for many things: target shooting, rappelling off cliffs, dodging grenades. She's lived through horrors that still give her nightmares. But nothing in Bailey's life-or-death training prepared her for caring for the tiny terror that is five-year-old Olivia Hale. Or how to control her raging attraction to Olivia's father, Streeter, the rugged, green-eyed cattle rancher who undermines her every move even when he stars in her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Streeter Hale has room for only two things in his life: his daughter and his job. He doesn't date. He doesn't get attached. Not anymore. So not only is Streeter stunned by Olivia's improved behavior after just a few days with Bailey, he's downright floored by his immediate attraction to the woman. But with secrets in her eyes and a body that doesn't quit, Streeter begins to worry that Bailey Masterson might just be the one woman to heal his fractured family and broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing's for sure--these two wrecked souls are spinning out of control as they desperately try not to fall in love...</description>

  <description>How far would you go to make the man that destroyed your family pay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddux Wilder is a man consumed, a beast in a three-piece suit. Rich and powerful, he built his empire with one thought in mind: revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of patience and planning, the wait is finally over. Tonight, Maddux will finally watch Theodore Cole’s kingdom crumble. At a lavish ball in the New York City castle the Wilder siblings call home, the man that killed their parents will atone for his sins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he’d planned for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arabella Cole is Theodore’s only child; his cherished and sheltered daughter. She’s an innocent, captivating beauty that would do anything to save her loving father, including sacrificing herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her freedom gone, she must surrender to a man she hates. A man that makes her want things she shouldn’t. A man that awakens deep, forbidden desires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everyone knows that roses don’t bloom in darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Maddux Wilder, a man that doesn’t believe in fairy tales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the beauty tame the beast or will revenge cost them both everything that matters most?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Emily March comes &lt;i&gt;Jackson&lt;/i&gt;, the newest novel in the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Eternity Springs&lt;/i&gt; series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes it takes a new beginning&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline Carruthers thinks she buried her dreams along with the love of her life...until a stranger named Celeste dares her to chase a dream all on her own. Moving to Redemption, Texas, is chapter one in Caroline's new life story. Opening a bookstore is the next. Finding love is the last thing on her mind as she settles into this new place called home. But when she meets a handsome, soulful man who's also starting over, all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;to reach a happily-ever-after&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson McBride came to Redemption looking only to find himself, not someone to love. Ever since his marriage ended, he's been bitter. Sure, he used to believe in love--he even has the old song lyrics to prove it--but the Jackson of today is all business. That is, until a beautiful young widow who's moved to town inspires a change of heart. Could it be that the myth of Redemption's healing magic is true...and Jackson and Caroline can find a second chance at a happy ending after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A brilliant writer you'll love creates a world you'll never want to leave."--Susan Mallery, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She signed away her freedom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Starved for affection, young Piper Delaney surrenders her life to a Master. But there is no love—only abuse. She’s told she can’t leave; she signed the slave contract. Years later, beaten and starving, she hears an English Dom say the contract’s illegal. Unenforceable. And she runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She reclaims her life and rises above the nightmare that was her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;But her enslavement left scars. She longs for love, but the only men who truly attract her also terrify her--Dominants. Hoping to conquer her fears, she visits Dark Haven, but the sounds of the club are too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a submissive panics, Sir Ethan steps in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The powerful English Dom recognizes the shivering submissive in his lap. Years before, he’d corrected her Master’s deceit about a contract. She’s come a long way since then. Cynical at being pursued for his wealth, he finds Piper’s honesty compelling. She’s intelligent, brave…and she needs him. What Dom could resist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s the Dom she’d dreamed about—perceptive, firm, and utterly self-confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;His voice pulls her from panic attacks. His arms enclose her in safety. He treats her like a person, not something to mistreat. As he helps Piper overcome her fears, she starts to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then her past finds her and destroys…everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It’s the depth of the characters, the engrossing nature of the plot, the realism of the conflict and the beautifully described settings that make a Cherise Sinclair novel…well, a Cherise Sinclair novel!&lt;/i&gt; ~ You Gotta Read Reviews&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEVER SAY NEVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie Gold is ready to take her career to the next level with the role of a lifetime. Finally, she can shake her reputation as a pretty face with more wealth and connections than talent. But Sadie is not prepared for the wild turn her own life is about to take. The man in charge of training Sadie for her most demanding role yet is none other than her first real boyfriend—the one who took her heart and ran away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bo Ibarra is as good-looking and irresistible as ever. Maybe even more so, now that everything once worked against them—Sadie’s pampered and privileged upbringing and Bo’s childhood in a family struggling to make ends meet—is in the past. But the future is still unwritten…and getting there, together, means coming clean about painful secrets and slashing through nasty tabloid rumors while trying to control the attraction that crackles between them. Maybe it’s finally time for them to walk off into the sunset and into a true and lasting love?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sequel to The Doctor's Secret&lt;br /&gt;Copper Point Medical: Book Two &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hospital’s least eligible bachelor and its aloof administrator hate each other… so why are they pretending to date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Owen Gagnon and HR director Erin Andreas are infamous for their hospital hallway shouting matches. So imagine the town’s surprise when Erin bids an obscene amount of money to win Owen in the hospital bachelor auction—and Owen ups the ante by insisting Erin move in with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copper Point may not know what’s going on, but neither do Erin and Owen. Erin intends his gesture to let Owen know he’s interested. Owen, on the other hand, suspects ulterior motives—that Erin wants a fake relationship as a refuge from his overbearing father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Erin suddenly heading a messy internal investigation, Owen wants to step up and be the hero Erin’s never had. Too bad Erin would rather spend his energy trying to rescue Owen from the shadows of a past he doesn’t talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This relationship may be fake, but the feelings aren’t. Still, what Erin and Owen have won’t last unless they put their respective demons to rest. To do that, they’ll have to do more than work together—they’ll have to trust they can heal each other’s hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited conclusion to the series that brought you NUDES (“passionate, emotional, and uplifting!” - #1 NY Times Bestseller Lauren Blakely) and BARE (“heartfelt and sexy!” – USA Today Bestselling Author Kate Meader), a young singer with stars in her eyes falls for a composer whose sordid background might strip them bare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant Mercer is on the run from his secrets…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was supposed to be an easy assignment—travel halfway across the globe and compose the musical score for an upcoming Hollywood movie by one of the biggest production companies in Los Angeles. One and done like dozens of times before. I wasn’t supposed to have my entire life crumble around me the moment my plane took off. I wasn’t supposed to meet her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intriguing and covered in ink, Simone enters my life like a storm, leaving only heartbreak in her wake. I should keep my distance. Hell, she should keep hers. Instead, we did the exact opposite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simone Reynolds is mending a broken heart…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just months after finaling in one of television’s most watched singing competitions, I should be riding the high of my life. I should be celebrating starring in a musical film predicted to rock the box office. It’s hard to bask in my success when my family is suffering a loss we never saw coming. And then there’s Grant—brooding and rugged and an absolute pain in my ass as he messes with my movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s as broken as I am, but the perfect harmony is only a leap of faith away.</description>

  <description>From USA Today bestselling author Stacey Kennedy comes a thrilling, sexy romance about a woman in danger and a small-town police detective who will do anything to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a sudden tragedy blew her world apart, Peyton Kerr fled her big city career and started over in Stoney Creek, Maine. So far, she’s loving small-town life–no one knows about her past, and her easy flirtation with Boone Knight gives her a reason to smile. But then someone is murdered in Peyton’s store, and her quiet, anonymous existence is instantly destroyed. To make matters worse, Boone–a police detective–is assigned to the case, and Peyton knows she can’t keep him at arm’s length any longer. She’s resisted the simmering heat between them–but now this gorgeous man is promising to keep her safe–and satisfied…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boone Knight doesn’t want the complications of a relationship. But when he volunteers to protect his town’s newest–and sexiest–resident, he finally admits he’d like to explore their sizzling attraction. And after one incredible night, everything changes for Boone. Peyton is sweeter–and braver–than anyone he’s ever met, and with her in his arms, everything makes sense. He just needs to convince her to trust him enough to reveal her secrets, or risk losing her to a merciless killer who seems to grow bolder with each passing day.</description>

  <description>Lincoln &lt;br /&gt;I’ve done a good job getting over my past. I’m not only proud of who I am, but revel in it. Still, I don’t let myself get too close to people. With closeness comes questions and those pesky feelings, and I’m having none of that. I’ve got a great job, friends, I’m cute and twinky, and my bed’s never empty. What more do I need? Except I can’t stop sleeping with Rush Alexander. I try, I really do, but I just can’t stay away, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is stressing me out. Rush has the power to hurt me—something I swore I’d never let happen again. Unfortunately, things become a little more complicated when I tell a white lie that lands me in a fake relationship with him. Yeah, not my best moment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rush &lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been an easygoing guy and don’t let many things get to me. I’ve worked hard to make my dream of becoming a professional motocross racer come true, and everything else is icing on the cake. Like Lincoln Gray, for example. I need to tread carefully, even though I want more from him than our occasional hookups. If I give what we have too much throttle, we’ll crash and burn. But when Linc accidentally announces we’re boyfriends in front of my mom, the race is on. First, I have to show him there’s more between us than the way we burn up the sheets together. When Linc finally trusts me in ways he doesn’t anyone else, there’s no turning back. I’m a firm believer that nothing worth having comes easily, and Lincoln Gray is worth it all. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Admirals captain Scott Hunter takes his pregame rituals very seriously. In this case, it’s not just a lucky smoothie he’s craving—it’s the man who made it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro hockey star Scott Hunter knows a good thing when he sees it. So, when a smoothie made by juice bar barista Kip Grady precedes Scott breaking his on-ice slump, he’s desperate to recreate the magic...and to get to know the sexy, funny guy behind the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kip knew there was more to Scott’s frequent visits than blended fruit, but he never let himself imagine being invited back to Scott’s penthouse. Or kissed with reckless abandon, never mind touched everywhere all at once. When it happens it’s red-hot, incredible and frequent, but also only on Scott’s terms and always behind his closed apartment doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott needs Kip in his life, but with playoff season approaching, the spotlight on him is suddenly brighter than ever. He can’t afford to do anything that might derail his career…like introducing the world to his boyfriend. Kip is ready to go all-in with Scott—but how much longer will he have to remain a secret?</description>

  <description>Shelby Walsh is struggling to make ends meet. She spends her days doing singing telegrams for extra cash, but she never expected to be sent out to perform for the world’s most famous composer. And definitely not in a skimpy Greek goddess outfit. How is she supposed to keep it together when every part of her is screaming for him to take her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Hayes is a recluse. He just wants to be left alone to work on his next big movie score. He’s even grumpier than usual because he’s in a bit of a rut. But when his brother sends him a singing telegram for inspiration, he finds his muse and plans to never let her go. Keeping her for his very own is the only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: We’ve teamed up with Fiona Davenport to give you an epic symphony for your lady business. What’s better than two authors working you over? How about four? If you want insta-love with all the safety and security of a happily ever after, then jump in bed with us. There’s room for more!</description>

  <description>Derek Tower has spent his life at war, first as a Green Beret and then as the owner of a private black-ops company, Cobra International Security. When a high-ranking US senator asks Cobra to protect his daughter, a midwife volunteering in Afghanistan, Derek’s gut tells him to turn the senator down. The last thing he wants to do is babysit an aid worker. But Jenna isn’t just another assignment. She’s also the younger sister of his best friend, the man who died taking bullets meant for him. There’s no way Derek can refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenna Hamilton doesn’t need a bodyguard, especially not one hired by her intrusive and controlling father. She knew the risks when she signed on to work in rural Afghanistan, and the hospital already has armed security. She also doesn’t need the distraction of a big, brooding operative skulking about, even if he is her late brother’s best friend—and sexy as hell. As far as she’s concerned, he can pack up his Humvee and drive into the sunset. And, no, nothing her hormones have to say about him will change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment his boots hit the ground in Afghanistan, Derek does his best to win Jenna over, posing as her brother so the two of them can spend time alone. Except that what he feels for her is anything but brotherly. Stolen moments lead to secret kisses—and an undeniable sexual attraction that shakes them both to the core. But events have been set into motion that they cannot escape. When a ruthless warlord sets his sights on Jenna, Derek will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even if it costs him his heart—or his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I've had his address and phone number all this time. I kept track of him.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those were the words my mother had said as she handed me the piece of paper that would change my life forever. The one that held my father’s name and address--the same father I’d always been told had died when I was a baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though my entire life until now, I’ve survived by being tightly-focused and in control, as soon as I learned my father was alive, I made a snap decision. I knew there was only one thing I could do: climb in the car and drive to meet him. The world’s most high-stakes road trip! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I didn’t know at the time was that things wouldn’t go as planned. My car would break down. Then, the sexiest man I’d ever seen would pull his motorcycle over to rescue me, and I’d be captivated by his eyes and his shoulders, by his strength and calm capability...and that’s when the real adventure would begin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve survived up until now by insisting on stability, but surviving's not enough for me anymore. With everything on the line, can I learn to truly live by Embracing Reckless? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stand-alone &lt;i&gt;Someday&lt;/i&gt; series romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When my feet hit the dirt at the Big Sky Dude Ranch, I have a pretty good idea what to expect. What happens next nearly shook me out of my brand-new cowboy boots. See, I’m here to write a travel article, but in one instant my interest in saddles, horses, and the Montana sky evaporate. All I see are blue eyes, chiseled cheekbones, and a black cowboy hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find out, is the quiet cowboy who owns this land is the measure of alpha. Quiet. Controlled. He’s older but has a body carved from fresh air and decades of hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do what I can to maintain my professionalism. After all, for two days he’s barely looked my way. And yet, he’s ruined every pair of panties I brought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One slip and everything changes. Garrett West shows me what’s underneath that calm cowboy exterior. And, let me tell you, it’s big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, we are from different worlds. Different decades. And some differences may be impossible to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: Saddle up for a ride that will leave you weak in the knees. This May-December pair do their best to maintain some distance, but once they are forced to touch, the sky opens and worlds collide in the hottest sort of way. Always safe, no cheating, and love at the speed of light.</description>

  <description>He’s got a secret. She’s telling lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anders Olsen has a big problem. When he joined forces with nine other Navy SEALs to build a model sustainable community, he didn’t know he’d be filmed—or that the resulting television show would become a nationwide sensation. Now everyone’s watching Base Camp, which means everyone’s watching him. The show’s rules dictate it’s his turn to marry. Can he find a bride before someone exposes who he really is? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Evelyn Wright believes she’ll change the world until an accident sends her home to Virginia. Now instead of an adventurous life as an aid worker in foreign lands, she’s stuck in a dead-end job, facing a dead-end future. So when an image crosses her desk that could bring a major oil corporation to its knees, Eve decides to find a way to share it with the widest audience she can. Base Camp has got great ratings. Can she find a way to get on the show? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Eve turns up at Base Camp, will she be the answers to Anders’ prayers, or the end to everything he most cares about? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Sugar is here for the cake and nothing more. She’s not proud of the fact that she sneaks into weddings just for the dessert, but she can’t help herself. There’s so much love in them and they’re so special and she knows she won’t ever get one for her very own. But everything changes when she has a taste of Hank. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank works in construction, so he’s good with his hands. He never thought he’d have to step in as a baker, but when his brother's cake gets destroyed the morning of the wedding, what choice does he have? One look at the unfamiliar woman eating his sweet treat and he’s ready to give her more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: You think we can base a whole romance around a woman’s love for wedding cake? You’re g*ddamn right we can! Come for the cake and stay for the romance… We promise to leave you satisfied!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When a plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness, the best place to land is in the arms of a younger man…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hotshot attorney Reuben Graham has finally agreed to take a vacation, when his plane suddenly plunges into the Alaskan wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just his luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his frustrations have only begun as he finds himself stranded with the injured, and superhot, pilot, a man who’s endearingly sociable—and much too young for Reuben to be wanting him this badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sole provider for his sisters and ailing father, Tobias Kooly is devastated to learn his injuries will prevent him from working or even making it back home. So when Reuben insists on giving him a place to recover, not even Toby’s pride can make him refuse. He’s never been tempted by a silver fox before, but something about Reuben is impossible to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recuperating in Reuben’s care is the last thing Toby expected, yet the closer they become, the more incredibly right it feels, prompting workaholic Reuben to question the life he’s been living. But when the pressure Toby’s under starts closing in, both men will have to decide if there’s room in their hearts for a love they never saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it love, or a little harmless pleasure?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Second in the Harmless series.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cynthia Myers meets Chris Dupree at her former fiance’s wedding. After a little dancing, and champagne, she ends up back in Chris’s hotel room. For one night of down and dirty sex. That’s it, that’s all. He lives far away, and she has other things to do…like get a life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris is a switch. He likes to dominate but he also likes to play the role of a submissive from time to time. His last relationship with a sub turned nasty and since then, he has shied away from anything but straight vanilla sex. When he meets Cynthia, he finds a woman who could change his mind. His mate. The only problem is he has to convince her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a carefully orchestrated seduction, Chris teaches Cynthia about submission and dominance, allowing her take the reins. As he leads her through pleasures she thought she’d never experience, Cynthia’s self confidence soars and she finds herself falling in love with him. But, when he asks for submission in the bedroom, can she surrender to prove her love or was it all about a little harmless pleasure?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This book was previously published, but has been substantially revised and expanded for Samhain Publishing.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Zach Mummert has never met a woman he didn't like—or a woman who didn't like him. Using his position as a winger for the York Bombers and his talent with social media, he always gets what he wants until he meets the one woman who doesn’t instantly succumb to his charms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Haley Addison lives life on her own terms: no rules, no commitments, and no regrets. Fiery in spirit and fiercely independent, she has no interest in being another notch in Zack’s hockey stick. Yet their explosive chemistry won’t be denied, especially when Zach comes to Haley’s rescue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's a fine line between love and hate, a line the mismatched pair crosses with as much passion in bed as out of it. No strings, no expectations. When Haley's past comes back to haunt her, putting her life in peril, Zach realizes that some things are worth fighting for—no matter the cost—and Haley has to learn to let go of the past if she wants to hang on to the future. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

It had the same elements as the others in the series but a different take on the story line. <br />Then romance was a little light on the beginning but that was understandable.

  <description>It’s impossible to know when you find the one from a photo, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a matter of thirty seconds, all my years knowing I’d die alone evaporate. Work is my life. My oil rigs are my girlfriends, my wives, and they take all of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman I see looking back at me on my phone screen is also about to become my step-sister. Turns out, she has nearly as much interest in a relationship as I did before her ice blue eyes melted my frozen heart. The most challenging job of my life is to convince her we were made for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a storm brewing from the past. Old losses turn to new grudges and they threaten to ruin everything. She’s too good for me. Too smart. Too everything. But, she’s mine, and I’ll breathe my dying breath making sure we get our shot. When you find the one, you just know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: Take a hard-living oil field alpha, a Mensa smart over-achiever a heap of blasting powder, a few old grudges from the past and watch things ignite. These two are the least likely to succeed together but in every way that counts are perfect. As always, this novella is safe, no cheating, steamy like scalding coffee and a happy ending that leaves you with a sigh.</description>

  <description>For five years, Cecilia Morgan’s entire existence has revolved around playing personal assistant to self-centered former NFL quarterback Wade Carter. But just when she finally gives her notice, his father’s health fails, and Wade whisks her back to his hometown. CC will stay for his dad—for now—even if that means ignoring how sexy her boss is starting to look in his Wranglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say CC’s notice is a bombshell is an insult to bombs. Wade can’t imagine his life without his “left tackle.” She’s the only person who can tell him “no” and strangely, it’s his favorite quality. He’ll do anything to keep her from leaving, even if it means playing dirty and dragging her back to Credence, Colorado, with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now they’re living under the same roof, getting involved in small-town politics, and bickering like an old married couple. Suddenly, five years of fighting is starting to feel a whole lot like foreplay. What’s a quarterback to do when he realizes he might be falling for his “left tackle”? Throw a Hail Mary she’ll never see coming, of course.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My Life in Shambles is an emotional and sexy new standalone contemporary romance from the New York Times bestselling author of A Nordic King and The Pact.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Valerie Stephens made the resolution to say yes to new adventures, she never thought she’d end up in the tiny town of Shambles, fake engaged to one of Ireland’s top rugby players. But there’s a first time for everything.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say bad things happen in threes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After my boyfriend broke off our engagement, I lost my apartment, and was laid off from my job, I can definitely attest to that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They also say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when my two sisters invited me to ring in the new year in Ireland, I decided to throw all caution to the wind and go for it. I was going to let “saying yes” be my new resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know I’d spend New Year’s Eve having a hot and dirty one-night stand with Padraig McCarthy, one hell of a sexy Irishman. I also didn’t know that the brooding and intense sex god was one of Ireland’s top rugby players. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rugby player with a proposition for me: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come with him to his tiny hometown of Shambles and pretend to be his fiancé for a few days, just so that his ailing father can have some peace of mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It sounded simple enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was anything but. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when a town gets up in your business, not when the media hunts you down, not when your past comes back in the picture, not when there are real hearts and feelings at stake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when there are secrets that could break you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my life in Shambles.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;These men never back away from danger—and always fall hard for love in &lt;i&gt;Cover Six Security&lt;/i&gt;, an explosive new series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Lisa B. Kamps.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daryl "Zeus" Anderson walks the edge of danger. Strong. Dependable. Always in control--except for that one night in a tropical paradise that still haunts him. When an old friend calls in a favor, Daryl answers the call, never expecting to come face-to-face with the woman who damn near shattered his restraint--and his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kelsey Davis has been running for the last five years: for her safety, for her sanity, for more than just her life. The dangerous game she's been thrust into is nearing an end and she's forced to turn to the man her father swears will guard her with his life--the same man she's already run away from once. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The clock is ticking and Kelsey needs to decide if she can trust her new guardian with more than her heart. Because in this game, there's more at stake than love--and making the wrong decision could cost much more than just their lives. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;He’s always been the player… but he’s about to get played.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LUCIO GALLO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on the rough Southside of Chicago, I learned how to play the field. Between my rugged good-looks, rock-hard body, and panty-melting smile, I was used to getting my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…But then she walked into my club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DELILAH MILES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have grown up with the finer things in life, but that doesn’t mean I take crap from anyone. I’m tough as nails, fiercely independent, and am never afraid to speak my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…But then then he stormed into my life.</description>

  <description>Vinnie Gallo's the hottest rookie in professional football.&lt;br /&gt;He's a smooth-talker, good with his hands, and knows how to score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca Hernandez thinks she's immune to Vinnie's charms. She's not impressed by the glitz, glamour, or fame, but after a six month self-imposed break from men and sex, she feels her resistance slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will stop Vinnie from trying to get the girl—not a crazy stalker, Bianca's two older brothers, or the fear he's falling in love.</description>

  <description>Jill Michaels prides herself on one thing: being independent. That is until her daughter gets into an elite school, and she needs money more than ever. It seems her fairy godmother—aka her deceased Grammy—has granted that wish in the form of one-fourth of her estate. The only catch? She must be married by her thirtieth birthday. In two months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaron Collins is fresh out of the army and back in town to help his father’s failing business. When he runs into Jill at a hotel where she’s attending a single’s mixer, he makes sure she doesn’t make it past his room and into another guy’s arms. When he hears about her predicament, he has a plan: they’ll get married and keep it a secret. And maybe have a little sexy fun until he leave towns for his new job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But letting go of the woman of his dreams may be harder than Aaron could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lorelei James kicks-off her Want You Series with a Lund family cousin hot enough to melt the ice and mend a broken heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former NHL star Jaxson Lund has returned to the Twin Cities, but he's at loose ends, unsure if he belongs at Lund Industries, or where he stands with Lucy, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Mimi. Despite the signs she'd like to leave him in the penalty box, the attraction burning between them reinforces his determination to prove that he deserves a second chance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Quade is in a good place with a steady job, a nice apartment, and a well-adjusted daughter, which is why she's hesitant when Jax insists on co-parenting. It's not that Lucy doesn't trust Jax...she's just unconvinced he can handle multiple responsibilities when he's been singularly focused on playing hockey. But when issues arise with Mimi, Lucy's shocked at how levelheaded and paternal he acts, giving her a glimpse of the Jax she used to know, the sexy, sweet man she fell for years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Lucy lets her guard down, Jax goes all in to show her how good they are together, but will their past remain too large an obstacle to ever overcome?</description>

  <description>“Sexy, sensitive, smart, and thoroughly researched, Annabeth Albert’s gay romances have rocketed to the top of my to-be-read pile. I’ve fallen as hard for her books as her heroes fall for each other.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Christopher Rice, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;A Density of Souls&lt;/em&gt; and the Burning Girl Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s built a quiet life for himself in Alaska. But it doesn’t stand a chance against the unrelenting pull of a man who’s everything he shouldn’t want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-military mountain man Griffin Barrett likes his solitude. It keeps him from falling back into old habits. &lt;em&gt;Bad habits. &lt;/em&gt;He’s fought too hard for his sobriety to lose control now. However, his gig as a wildlife guide presents a new kind of temptation in superhot supermodel River Vale. Nothing the Alaskan wilderness has to offer has ever called to Griffin so badly. And that can only lead to trouble…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River has his own methods for coping. Chasing adventure means always moving forward. Nobody’s ever made him want to stand still—until Griffin. The rugged bush pilot is the very best kind of distraction, but the emotions he stirs up in River feel anything but casual, and he’s in no position to stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With temptation lurking in close quarters, keeping even a shred of distance is a challenge neither’s willing to meet. And the closer Griffin gets to River, the easier it is to ignore every last reason he should run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publisher’s Note: &lt;em&gt;Arctic Sun&lt;/em&gt; deals with topics some readers may find difficult, including sobriety and eating disorders.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This cowboy's handsome, sexy, and definitely off limits . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walker Everett spends his days at the Crossroads Ranch wrangling cattle-and steering clear of anything that would complicate his already too-complicated life. Until Violet Chastain, the ranch's newest employee, asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend for her parents' anniversary party. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever met and needs his help. How can he refuse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet isn't about to fall for a brooding bad-boy cowboy, no matter how sizzling their chemistry. But she also never expected Walker to go along with the charade. Before long, he's charming her parents at their weekly dinners and kissing her way more than necessary. Spending so much time together tests the limits of their "just friends" relationship, but what happens when their game of pretend becomes all too real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes the bonus story &lt;i&gt;Rocky Mountain Cowboy&lt;/i&gt; by Sara Richardson!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Whether it was due to lack of funds, lack of desire, or one lame excuse after another, Rex Sharpe has managed to ignore the one and only dream he’s ever had: turning his family’s dilapidated old farmhouse into a bed and breakfast. Until now. When his cousin Travis Walker decides to invest in a venture that will help revitalize the small town of Coyote Ridge, Rex knows it’s time to put up or shut up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say third time’s a charm, right? Jack Cunningham learns that’s not always true. When his world is unexpectedly tipped on its axis, Jack does what he does best. He runs. Only this time, he doesn’t get far. A one-night encounter with a sexy cowboy has Jack’s already topsy-turvy world spinning even more, and he soon learns, it’s only the beginning.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One daring kiss with the playboy tempts the good girl, but can she tame him?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autry Hill may be a cowboy to his boots, but he’s also gained quite the reputation as a charmer and playboy. His parents aren’t sure he’s ready to take the reins of the family’s prosperous Texas ranch, so they set up a challenge: No women or scandal for the next six months and the ranch house he grew up in is his. Easy peasy, Autry thinks. He’s already tired of late nights and romancing, until elementary school teacher Beth Cooper happens to cross his path. Suddenly Autry is losing his heart, his mind, and what’s left of his reputation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good girl teacher Beth Cooper is far too practical to fall for Autry Hill, even if she had a crush on him way back when. The man’s been breaking hearts since middle school. But when he becomes her unexpected champion and then they work together to help one of Beth’s troubled students who’s about to lose everything, she sees a different side of Autry – serious, compassionate, determined and dedicated. And that Autry is nearly impossible to resist. Does she need to?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; He’s alpha, he’s sexy, and he’s sure he’s got life in his hands … Until Ashley Easton returns, wanting nothing to do with the playboy who broke her heart. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Knight is a closer. Be it a business deal or the woman of his choice, everything he wants is his for the taking. Sexy and irresistible, a wink, a smile, or a handshake always seals the deal. Until Ashley returns at the worst possible time, and everything unravels around him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Ashley who returns is sassy and sexy--everything Sebastian craves and he wants a second chance. Despite her reluctance, his sex appeal makes it harder and harder to keep him at arm’s length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sebastian might have a talent for sealing the deal, but Ashley is no longer easily charmed. This time he’s going to have to work to win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Standalone Romance&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Loving her is the biggest fight of his life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home from the Marines, Noah Cortez has a secret he doesn’t want his oldest friend, Kristina Moore, to know. It kills him to push her away, especially when he’s noticing just how sexy and confident she’s become in his absence. But, angry and full of fight, he’s not the same man anymore either. Which is why Warrior Fight Club sounds so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristina loves teaching, but she wants more out of life. She wants Noah—the boy she’s crushed on and waited for. Except Noah is all man now—in ways both oh so good and troubling, too. Still, she wants who he’s become—every war-hardened inch. And when they finally stop fighting their attraction, it’s everything Kristina never dared hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Noah is secretly spiraling, and when he lashes out, it threatens what he and Kristina have found. The brotherhood of the fight club helps him confront his demons, but only Noah can convince the woman he loves that he’s finally ready to fight for everything.</description>

He couldn't possibly love her, including her secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gage Everly knows exactly what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;From the moment he met Ivy, his world spun out of control. He's never wanted anyone as much as he wants her, secret and all. Now, if he could only convince her to take a chance on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"When two stars collide, Ivy, they either collapse or merge to form something better. You and me. We collide, and we'll be so much more. Together."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++&lt;br /&gt;A spin-off tale of the band managed by Tommy Carrigan from After Care.</description>

  <description>When ER nurse Nora Sellers is hurt in a hospital scuffle, firefighter Zach Walker blames himself. Blaming himself is nothing new. He’s been blaming himself for years for the trauma his baby sister endured as a teenager. Though with his happy–go–lucky attitude no one would know it. He’s good at his job, he’s a good brother, and a good friend, but Zach decided long ago he wasn’t husband and father material. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even so, when Zach learns Nora is a single mother with a house that needs his help, he can’t walk away. After a few days with Nora and her ten month old son, he knows he doesn’t want to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But Nora’s wary. She learned at a young age that the only person she can count on is herself. Now with a baby, a job, and a fixer–upper house, the last thing Nora wants is a sexy firefighter, making her heart flutter. But Zach is more than what he seems, and the more she gets to know him the harder he is to resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She’s been brave all her life. Can she be brave one more time and take a chance of a lifetime with her heart? </description>

  <description>When tattoo artist, Liam O’Rourke, meets a hot new ink model promoting a sexy calendar at an LA tattoo convention, sparks fly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam admires Velvet like every red-blooded man in the convention center. The way she moves, her sexy pinup look and a body to die for; what man wouldn’t want that? She seems so strong and confident. But it’s the look in her eyes when she meets his that has him lightheaded. They hold a vulnerability that defy the sexy pose and call out to him. That look awakens a fierceness in him that has him wanting to protect her. She’s the beauty to his beast, and he can’t forget her. &lt;br /&gt;After an incredible night together, she vanishes, leaving him with nothing but questions, only to reappear in the last place he expects to find her. She’s gorgeous and irresistible, but she’s also hiding something from him. Liam must decide if she’s worth the risk if he’s going to save her from her past or lose her forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Velvet comes from a family of con artists. She grew up learning all their scams. When she was fourteen, her mother forced her into traveling from town to town, with Velvet playing the leading lady in the longest running con her mother ever pulled. &lt;br /&gt;She’s fought to put all that behind her, until she crosses paths with the one man who left an indelible mark on more than her skin. Velvet remembers Liam, but fortunately he doesn’t recognize her, because there’s something he doesn’t know and she can’t risk him ever finding out. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dylan Sutton doesn’t go looking for trouble, but it always seems to find him. After the devastating loss of his father, he travels across the country to deliver a letter to his dad’s estranged best friend. But surely, he deserves a night of relaxation when he first gets to town, right? He sets his sights on the attractive older guy at the bar—except his almost-one-night-stand turns out to be the very man he’s in town to see. Oops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clayton Turner has a nasty habit of either losing or hurting the people he cares about. After his partner died, he’d decided keeping to himself was the smartest life choice. He doesn’t count on trouble stumbling into his life in the form of a sexy guy twenty years his junior… and for that guy to be linked to one of the most painful losses of Clay’s past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fate steps in and Dylan gets stranded in Bailey Springs. He gets a job, and Clay can’t stop himself from trying to help Dylan get on his feet. And Dylan? Well, Dylan can’t seem to stop flirting with Clay. He tries, he really does…just about as much as Clay attempts not to like it. They couldn’t be more different…or are they? Soon, Trouble and Sad Eyes realize they have a lot more in common than they thought, and once they land in bed together, there’s no going back. Moving forward isn’t any easier, though. Clay’s always walked the straight and narrow, always followed all the rules. But what does he do when the only right path involves looking for trouble?</description>

  <description>Stand-alone Valentine Bay romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Troy Valentine gave up everything when his parents died, leaving his career as a pro baseball player to come home to Valentine Bay and raise his little sister, Mila. It’d been so long since he put himself first or thought about what he wanted, it was hard to even remember what that felt like. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broadway star Alison Bartholomew needed a break from her high-pressure theater career and all the scrutiny and judgement that went with it. When she meets Troy on the first morning of her Valentine Bay getaway, she starts to wonder: could a short sabbatical turn into something more lasting? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Troy and Alison can't help but be drawn to each other, but is the force binding them together stronger than the one pulling them in different directions? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;18+ &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Damien Prescott, and I had the kind of life most men only dream of. I ran a successful company, had millions of dollars to my name, and had the company of beautiful women at my disposal any time I snapped my fingers. My work and money were the only things that mattered to me. I was a shark in the advertising world and people often told me I was impatient, rude, and arrogant. Did I care? No. I was a workaholic and reaping the rewards every day. Then I unexpectedly met this beautiful annoying woman. She got under my skin and drove me crazy. Her views on life were so different from mine. She was irresponsible and we were complete opposites, but that didn't stop the feelings that started to emerge inside me. She was only in New York for one month and I found myself wanting her to permanently stay.My name is London Everly and I traveled around the country seeing and doing the things I'd dreamed of since I was a kid. I wasn't running and I wasn't hiding. I was just experiencing the gifts and beauty that life had to offer. I was on my way to New York when I unexpectedly met a handsome man with many flaws. He was rude, arrogant, uptight, egotistical, cocky, and a major workaholic. He couldn't appreciate what life had to offer because the only thing he focused on was wealth. But even though he was all those things, it didn't stop the feelings I developed for him, unexpected feelings that I couldn't allow.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Nighthawks are hockey’s new expansion team. They’re ice hot. And they’re all about the chase.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Christian:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; They call me a hockey god because I’m a beast on the ice . . . and off. Men want to be me and women just want me. But now that the New York Nighthawks expect me to lead their team to victory, it’s all work and no play. My eyes are on the prize. Until I meet Serena Ellis, a sexy, curvalicious blonde who doesn’t know me from jack. And just like that, I’m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Serena:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; I don’t do one-night stands—especially with celebrity jocks who date models. Lots of models. But the god of hockey is a temptation that’s hard for mere mortals to resist. And after the best kiss of my life, I’m ready to throw my one-night stand rule out the window. Except Christian Chase won’t let me. He doesn’t want a one-night stand. He wants it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Liam Cavanagh works three dead-end-jobs to take care of his family. He’s been the sole breadwinner since he was fifteen and yearns for a life of his own. Forced to grow up too fast, he carries the burdens of responsibilities that shouldn’t be his, and it’s slowly destroying him. The more he tries to control, the more out of control he feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he gets a hit on a personal ad he placed on The Boys Club app, he shrugs it off as impossible. With nearly 600 miles between him and “Boston Daddy” he knew the odds were against them. Until Boston Daddy’s current boy convinces him otherwise and persuades Liam to take on the role of Daddy’s new boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying forty-year-old entrepreneur Cash Moreau is having a bad week is an understatement. The man he’s been with for years leaves him for a new job, his own company is in crisis, and to top it all off, a young stranger shows up on his doorstep with all his worldly possessions, claiming to be his new boy. Liam wants a Daddy to depend on, and Cash refuses to believe he’s what’s best for Liam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their powerful connection, Cash finally pushes Liam away, and the beautiful boy who stole his heart disappears. Soon, Cash realizes what he’s let slip through his fingers. The elusive thing he’s been searching for is Liam, it’s only ever been Liam, and suddenly Cash will move heaven and earth to find what he’s lost. Will he find his boy in time to make things right, or is it too late to let him in?</description>

  <description>Owen Shaw and his “brothers” lost everything, their entire existence erased. Science had robbed him and all the Lost Boys of their memories and their past, but not their future. Hunted by every intelligence agency in the world, they are focused on two goals: find a cure for what was done to them and ensure that the technology that ruined their lives doesn’t get out into the world. Rebecca Walsh might be the key to achieving both. Owen has been studying her closely, living in her building, and he cannot resolve how such a beautiful, giving woman could have helped design the evil process that destroyed his past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Rebecca Walsh has dedicated her life to researching the secrets of the mind. Her atmospheric rise in her field was fueled by the horror of watching her mother’s agonizing journey into madness at the hands of a disease with no cure. She vowed to never rest until she finds it. But obsession takes a heavy toll, and when Owen moves into her building she realizes how much of her life she has missed out on. Owen opens her eyes to a whole new world, filled with joy, laughter, and possibly love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Owen and Rebecca grow closer, unraveling more about each other and the mysteries surrounding her connection to Hope McDonald. As the sinister forces working against the Lost Boys descend on Toronto, secrets long buried are uncovered that could shatter the bonds holding the Lost Boys together and cost Rebecca her life. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Stand-alone Crossroads romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her Type A personality, Bea Porter meticulously planned her friend Bailey's bachelorette party in Vegas. Her plans did not include receiving contraception in the lobby of the hotel, walking in on two naked people (one of them dripping wet) and sustaining a head injury less than an hour after arriving in sin city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Series MVP CJ Rossum hadn't planned on attending his sister Bailey's bachelorette party. He also hadn't planned on meeting a girl with eyes so blue they rivaled the Mediterranean, or claiming that girl was his girlfriend when he didn't even know her name or making a pinky promise he knew he couldn't keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes life and &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; have plans of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18+</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I always get what I want. Every time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But not with her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The beautiful woman my father forced on me through our billion-dollar firm has curves that make me ache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never in my short life did I imagine falling for her. Office romances are forbidden in my company. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she’s a rule breaker. I guess I am too, but no one knows that side of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This single mother with brilliant business sense has a side hustle and still kicks ass at my firm daily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s no way in hell she’s giving in. No matter what I try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not even when Valentine’s rolls around. And I pull out all the stops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her denial has me needing her like I’ve never needed anyone else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Where this girl is concerned, I’m not asking for a friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m asking for me. For today. Tomorrow. Forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Single Mom BBW Romance&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Rockstar. Actor. Entrepreneur. I’m Lachlan Marcus, and I just walked out on my empire. I bought a ball cap and a pair of cheap sunglasses and took the first bus leaving the station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I landed in a small town looking straight into the eyes of an angel with auburn curls and curves that bring to life my inner barbarian, determined to make her mine. She’s naïve, yet wise, and sees directly into my soul like no one ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within twenty-four hours, I’ve got her inside the wedding chapel and my last name attached to her. Only she has no idea who I really am. I represent everything in this world she’s been taught to distrust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life I left has come calling, and I’m losing her before our life together can even begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: This famous hero hasn’t touched a woman in longer than he can remember, and she’s never been kissed. They don’t waste any time heating up the pages and making up for what they’ve been missing. This super-fast steamy read is safe, no cheating and has the best kind of happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shut out the noise and listen to your heart . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Worse than a one-hit wonder, Tassia Hogan is a one-line wonder. Infamous for a memorable, extremely provocative verse, her music career is going nowhere. Finding a decent man to date has also proven fruitless . . . they all think she's as wanton as those lyrics. But now her label is offering Tassia the chance to shine--with a catch. The album is duets. Her partner is a Country Western singer. And he's just as reluctant to agree as she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hyde Love has been in the music business since he was eleven, and he's becoming more and more disenchanted with it. Collaborating on an album seems great in theory, but Tassia is an R&amp;amp;B singer. Melding their sounds and personalities will be difficult--though not as tough as keeping things strictly business. Getting involved with his partner could prove career-wrecking, yet discovering the real Tassia could be earth-shattering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Crystal B. Bright &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Engaging characters you want to get to know better."--&lt;i&gt;Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;on&lt;i&gt; The Look of Love&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Thankfully she’s rescued by a dark knight named Rocco, but his heroic act is seen as a violent attack after the judge is bought off and Rocco is sent to jail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocco Lang took one look at the blonde and knew he had to save her.

You’re damn right they can! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This alpha might be behind bars, but he’s still running the show. Grab your jumpsuits and cozy up because this prison romance is everything your Valentine’s Day needs!</description>

  <description>Waiting for Willa &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes the newest installment in her beloved Big Sky Series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Max Hull left Cunningham Falls a long time ago. Thanks to his killer instincts and business smarts, he’s come back to town richer than anyone’s wildest imagination. Now he’s closer to his family, living in his dream home, and at the top of his career—it sure looks like he has it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All but one thing. And she’s not interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willa Monroe and Max were childhood sweethearts. She daydreamed about their wedding day and named their children, but Max’s dreams were bigger than her. After high school, he left her behind without another word. Now, Willa is a single mother and a successful business owner, and the heartbreak of losing Max was a very long time ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s moved on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when he walks into her shop and back into her life, suddenly it feels like no time has passed at all. He’s as handsome as ever, and more charming than she remembered. Once he makes friends with her son and turns his attention on her, how long will she be able to resist him? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And does she really want to? Sometimes you do get a second chance at first love. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bailey Rossum was living out a bad country song. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After being stood up and having her pickup truck break down, Bailey found herself walking barefoot in a ball gown down a back road. And when her sexier-than-sin ex rides up on his steel horse Bon Jovi style to rescue her, she knows she has to accept his help even if it means breaking her heart all over again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Josh Scott had no interest in being anyone’s hero. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After finding the only woman he’d ever loved stranded on the side of the road, Josh knew that he had to do the right thing. And when his headlight shone on long silky, blonde hair, huge doe eyes, and the most perfect set of lips ever created he knew his already shattered heart was in serious trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To live in the present, Josh and Bailey have to face their past. If they do they just might have a future… and it all starts with just one night.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A gorgeous former Marine with a tortured soul.&lt;br /&gt;The beautiful, compassionate therapist living next door.&lt;br /&gt;A meddlesome grandma determined to get them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From USA Today Bestselling Author Melanie Harlow comes an all new standalone romance that will make you believe in the redemptive power of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a proposal on my birthday, and I got dumped instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could I have been so clueless?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grams knew exactly how to distract me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “cute boy next door” who’s been helping her with yard work clearly needs a little therapy. Who better to call than her newly single therapist granddaughter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She even fakes dementia to get me to visit, and now that I’m here she’s doing everything in her power to throw us together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I’m complaining. Ryan is the sexiest man I’ve ever met--I mean the full package, from the chiseled jaw to the massive shoulders to the rippling abs. (And yes, his package is full, and he knows exactly how to deliver it.) He makes me want to get out of my head and follow my heart. He makes me want to take chances I never thought I’d take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also makes me want to take my clothes off. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he’s moody and challenging--one minute he’s an open book, and the next he’s completely closed off. He holds me like he’ll never let go, but insists he wants to be alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some wounds are so deep, only love can heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I convince him to let me try?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This sizzling and passionate romance follows two men whose lives are turned upside down by their intense mutual attraction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Richmond is a workaholic in danger of becoming the very man he despises—his father. Stressed and sick with worry, he’s desperate to shake off the shackles that bind him to his current path and embark on a life lived only for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His friends are determined to pull him out of his funk and decide to drag him to a strip club that caters to both men and women. Sam is shocked when he develops an attraction to the show’s male headliner: Rico McIntyre. The two men end up in a backroom for a private lap dance that ends up being a game-changer for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, despite the fact that they both identify themselves as heterosexual, they decide to explore their strange attraction for one another—if only for one night. But one night quickly becomes another and then another, until a misunderstanding tears the two apart. Both men attempt to forget about the other, only for life to unexpectedly reunite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Sam and Rico embark on a relationship and come to terms with their new understandings of themselves and who they love? Or are they doomed from the start?</description>

  <description>Audrey Martinez is a veterinarian who has devoted her whole life to the care and protection of horses―even if doing so leaves her little time for meeting a man. Who would have thought that a strange case of criminal horseplay would lead her to falling deeply, wildly in love? If only the man who makes her heart race faster than a wild mustang would let his guard down, that is. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb Harper is no ordinary cowboy. Sure, he wears his hat, boots, and jeans like a second skin, and displays an easygoing charm that comes from years of working on the ranch. But with his military background, and Army buddies at his side, he is tried-and-true Texas tough. Audrey knows she can trust a man like Caleb to help her save horses. But can Caleb trust himself to resist his attraction to Audrey―or will the sparks of their desire end up getting them burned?</description>

  <description>For Dillon Frayser, a rising star for The Baltimore Banners hockey team, life has come easy. A solid childhood, a happy family, a natural talent for playing the game he loves. The only thing missing is the degree he promised his parents he would get soon after he was drafted. If he could just force himself to focus on carbon atoms and organic chemistry, he wouldn't have to worry about squeezing in embarrassing tutoring sessions between a busy schedule filled with practices and games. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie Andersen dreads meeting her new student but she needs the money that tutoring will provide. That doesn't mean she's willing to put up with the anticipated antics of an arrogant brainless jock. When she finally meets Dillon, he turns out to be the exact opposite of what she expected: smart, funny, driven, and humble. Maggie soon finds herself letting her guard down and discovering a different kind of chemistry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will the tutoring sessions lead to something more for the mismatched pair? Or is this nothing more than a one-timer for the sexy hockey player?</description>

  <description>As head coach for Baltimore's hockey team, The Banners, Sonny LeBlanc has seen it all. Guts and glory. Hard-hitting and hard-headed players. A rise to fame and a plummet to failure. Scarred, determined, and tough-as-nails, he's never met a challenge he couldn't conquer—until he meets Monica Jennings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single mother who's survived an abusive marriage, Monica Jennings is finally learning to live—little by little. That doesn't mean she's learned to trust and it certainly doesn't mean she's willing to open her heart to anyone but her daughter and her sister. And then she meets Sonny LeBlanc, the scarred coach of The Baltimore Banners. There's something about him that makes her want to take a chance—or run in the other direction and hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Sonny teach the cautious woman how to embrace love and life, or will he lose it all by calling the riskiest play of his career?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DAX:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job is putting out fires--PR fires, that is. Partner in one of the most prestigious PR firms in Hollywood, I've lived most of my life helping others stay in the spotlight but keeping as far away from it myself as humanly possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Jace Kruse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#HottieFirefighter is the hashtag everyone is using for the overnight Insta-star who made headlines when a pic of him with a pooch he saved from a runaway vehicle went viral. Doesn't have anything to do with my life until a major potential client shows interest in an endorsement deal with the internet sensation, and Jace becomes my ticket to stomping the ass of one of my company's fiercest competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is: Jace isn't swayed by dreams of fame and fortune. He prefers his down-to-earth life in Fever Falls and has turned down every company who's approached him to leech off his recently acquired celebrity status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where others have failed, I'm confident I can succeed. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's persuading. And after a few encounters with Jace, the easy-go-lucky, ever-charming, sexy-as-hell, and surprisingly #topcurious firefighter has me persuading him about more than signing on for an endorsement deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He may be good at putting out fires, but Jace sure knows how to start them in the bedroom...and then in my heart. However, between his rising star power and the intensity of my feelings, I know where this inferno is leading, and if we don't put it out soon, someone's gonna get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;#BURN is part of the Fever Falls series but can be read and enjoyed as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Megan Harrison is the owner of &lt;i&gt;Kinky Spurs. &lt;/i&gt;She’s mortgaged up to her eyeballs and works long days and nights, but she’s living life on her terms, not on her wealthy father’s. She’s done being in the cattle rancher’s shadow. She’s got it all figured out, except for the part that involves Nash Blackshaw. He’s a sexy as hell cowboy whose smile can easily charm her out of her tight jeans. The only problem is—their fathers were business rivals, and Megan and Nash have been taught to hate each other since birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nash Blackshaw, a retired professional bull rider, has responsibilities on top of responsibilities. With his PBR career over due to back injury, and his focus narrowed on heading up the Blackshaw Cattle Company’s Guest Ranch, he shouldn’t have time to think about all the ways he wants Megan. But it’s all he thinks of around the sassy and sweet woman. She might be forbidden to him, but Nash wants to take her for a hard, kinky ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But small towns have a way of spreading gossip like wildfire, and not everyone is happy about their relationship. Especially when Megan drops a bombshell on Nash after one heated night between them. As much as Megan and Nash want to forget the old feud between their fathers and lose each other in explosive passion, they can’t escape reality. They are meant to be enemies, and Nash’s sizzling, dominant touch might not be enough to keep them together.</description>

  <description>Born into a prominent ranching family and brought up in a disciplined household, Sheriff Jared Monroe has high standards of how to live his life and he doesn’t hesitate to hold the people around him to the same accountability. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Misty Foster is a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Her mother slept her way through the men in town and everyone thinks Misty has followed in her mother’s footsteps. If they knew the truth they’d be more than shocked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One blustery, snowy night Jared and Misty do something completely uncharacteristic—they throw caution to the wind and fan the flames of their passion. Now there’s a third person to consider. An innocent baby is on the way and when Jared finds out, he instantly steps forward to do the right thing. Unfortunately, Misty doesn’t agree with his future plans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s a no nonsense sheriff to do now that he’s met his match? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s known as Father Anton to his teammates—the brooding, sexy captain of the NHL’s Chicago Blaze has a reputation for…not having a reputation. Just like his diet and sleep routines, celibacy is part of Anton Petrov’s on-ice mojo. Or so they say. Anton stays mum on the subject. If the world thinks he chooses to abstain from sex, so be it. Better that than the truth getting out: there is a woman he burns for, but he can never have her. She’s his teammate’s wife, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Marceau is finally on her own. Now that she and her husband are living apart, she’s finding the peace she was desperate for. She spends her days in classes and late nights bartending, making her own way in the world at last. After what she’s been through, as long as her husband leaves her alone, she doesn’t plan to rock the boat. He still has the power to hurt those dearest to her, and she can’t demand a divorce with such a high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter with Mia has Anton hoping for a shot he never thought he’d get. And while she’s drawn to the intense, serious hockey center, Mia’s leery about playing with fire. That’s all Anton has ever known for Mia, though—a living, burning desire that won’t be denied—no matter the cost.</description>

  <description> In the Alaska wilderness, four streetwise boys became men—and brothers &lt;p&gt;Now the crazy ex-military survivalist who plucked Gabriel and three other boys from an abusive foster care home has died. But the sarge leaves them a final mission--to revive the dying town of Rescue. &lt;/p&gt; Gabe is done with being a hero. &lt;p&gt;Wounded in body and soul, the retired SEAL simply wants to remain holed up in his isolated cabin. He sure doesn’t want to be chief of police in some defunct town. But he has his orders.&lt;/p&gt; Audrey needs a place to hide &lt;p&gt;After the Chicago librarian discovers a horrendous crime, she wakes to an assassin in her bedroom. Injured and terrified, she flees, covering her trail every inch of the way. New name, new ID. New home. As Audrey learns to survive in Rescue, she begins to fall for the town…and the intimidating chief of police who protects it. &lt;/p&gt; Can the shy introvert and the deadly police chief find a life together? &lt;p&gt;Despite the discord in town, Gabe is finding his own peace…with the quiet young woman who seems to have no past. She’s adorable and caring and so very lost. But how can he trust someone who lies to him with every breath she takes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>She’s nothing but trouble . . . and he can’t resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised by a pro football legend, Miami Thunder wide receiver Rep Grissom has a career most would envy. A toxic marriage with a party girl almost put him on the sidelines, but now he keeps his head down and makes the moves on the field that leave younger players in his dust. Now all he has to do is maintain the status quo and he’s guaranteed a lucrative new contract at an age when most guys are retiring. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lola Corbin is used to leaving all the big boys in her rearview mirror. The lead singer in the worlds biggest rock band she fills up arenas and closes down the clubs but with the group on the brink of breaking apart her future is uncertain. Years spent on the road has left her with nothing at home except platinum records on the walls, an empty fridge, and a cold bed. For the first time, she’s looking for something and someone beyond the spotlight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lola’s first night in her condo ends with Rep breaking up a fight he realizes that temptation has moved in next door. Lola doesn’t usually go for the strong and serious types, but the more she sees of her neighbor, the more she wants. When a thank you dinner turns into dancing and a hot tryst in the back of the club their attraction cannot be denied. But when Lola-induced trouble results in a front-page-career-ending spectacle the player must decide if he’s going to be as daring with his heart as he is on the field. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;We vowed forever. What we got was two years.&lt;br /&gt;But now I’m back to take back what was stolen from me.&lt;br /&gt;She’s mine to have, and mine to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Again&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A filthy oil-rig roughneck like me had no business with a wife like her. She was the pretty little flower I never should have put my dirty hands on. But Leanna was my everything. My heart. My obsession. And one year ago, they told me another man took her away from me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…I just found out that was &lt;i&gt;bullshit&lt;/i&gt;. And now, there’s going to be &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt; to pay.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her family never thought I was good enough for her. The wrong side of the tracks, and too rough and savage for their sweet, innocence Leanna. They lied to keep me from her, and her from me. But now that I know the truth?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, now I’m coming back for what’s &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m twice the man I was before—harder, fiercer, and even more obsessed. For richer or for poorer? Well, she had me poor and loved every second of my rough hands pinning her to our marriage bed. I’ve made my fortune since, but I’m ready to throw it all away to get her back in my arms where she belongs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bastards that took her from me think they can keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…They’re dead fucking wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year ago, I thought I lost her. Two days ago, I learned the truth. And tonight, I’m taking back my bride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I’ll burn the whole world down to get her if I have to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking for a ridiculously over the top alpha hero completely obsessed with claiming his one and only? You’re in the right place!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one’s equal parts sweeter than sugar and hotter than sin, and I’m pretty sure you’re going to eat it right up ;).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this standalone is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Amy Andrews turns up the heat in her smuttiest little book to-date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had a crush on Stefanie, my best friend’s older sister, since I was fifteen. As a geeky gamer with a bad case of acne, she was totally out of my league. But I’m all grown up now, with a medical degree and an in-depth knowledge of female anatomy I’m not afraid to use. When we cross paths again I finally get my chance to live out a few teenage fantasies and prove I can be her guy. I just have to convince Stef to take a chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stefanie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a resident nurse,I’ve had enough of arrogant doctors to last me a lifetime. I’m not looking for another. I’m especially not looking to hook up with my kid brother’s bestie—ten years my junior—even if he has morphed into a walking, talking, wet dream. If only he wasn’t sleeping in my spare bed for three weeks and making it very clear he wants to be in my bed instead. Not going to happen. I don’t do casual anymore. No matter how much I want to open my legs for the DILF.</description>

  <description> I wanted the sassy little lady the second I first saw her.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caleb&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had all the success that a self-made man like me could want. But something was still missing. Ready for a break, I returned to my hometown to find myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And found her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Riley-Ann. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sassy, curvy bartender-slash-waitress at the local watering hole, with a body made just for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as it turned out, she was the only woman around to turn me down. And a virgin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's why I put in a bid for lunch with her at the county fair auction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And nothing was going to stop me from winning her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Riley-Ann&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought my life was finally on the right track, then it all fell apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Booted from the only promising office manager job I ever wanted, I turned tail and took a break from everything at my best friend's ranch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The local saloon was hiring, so I got a job to keep my mind and my hands occupied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he showed up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caleb Jackson Reeves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The biggest name in business around these parts sat down at my bar. He was larger than life, older, wiser, and hot as hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the square-jawed, ruggedly handsome older man wanted me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was in no state to deal with anything else in my life right now, not even him. Not his gifts, not his attention, not even the smoldering kiss he planted on me. The one I denied enjoying so much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except the first chance he got, he made a bid for lunch with me at the county fair auction. And he won. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, I was bought and paid for, and he wasn't about to let this chance slip away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning.&lt;/b&gt; This hot and dirty western romance is steamy, spicy, and chock full of feels. If you like slightly over the top romance stories with a big strong alpha male who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to ask nicely for it, this is for you! Standalone romance with no cliffhanger and a sweet happily ever after to make you swoon.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>short and sweet</strong><br /><br />The author does a great job on this short but very sweet book. Caleb and Riley-Ann had amazing chemistry from the beginning and lasted throughout the book. <br />It has a good flow except I did think it needed a stronger ending. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; From NYT and USA Today bestselling author, Gina L. Maxwell, comes a brand new series with a fresh twist on an old classic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time, in Neverland, North Carolina--I fell in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was twelve when Peter first climbed up to my balcony.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen when I sneaked out to see him at the School for Lost Boys.&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen when his touch made me fly,&lt;br /&gt;And eighteen when his words made me cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were magnetic, drawn to each other from that very first night, and what I thought would be forever. But when it came time for me to leave, he wouldn't come with, so I left town with a map for my future and a shattered heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ten years later, I've returned to Neverland, hoping to find a man in place of the boy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter was partially right, growing up is no fun. After quitting my fancy career that sucked the magic out of life, I'm now organizing the fundraiser of the year. In a move that could make or break the event and my new company, I've hired Peter, master mechanic and owner of LB Automotive, to help me pull this off--trusting him to rebuild a classic car for the auction that could help hundreds of foster kids in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was prepared, but the boy who refused to leave is now a man hell-bent on getting me to stay, and as sparks fly between us, that undeniable fire flares back to life, deeper and hotter than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that ripped body doesn't mean Peter's matured enough to make us or this event work, and not everyone in Neverland is happy about my return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every wound heals.&lt;br /&gt;Not every heart can be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Not every boy grows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after all this time, the love we found might be lost to us again...this time, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Pan is an adult contemporary romance retelling of Peter Pan, complete with Wendy, Hook, Tink, and all the Lost Boys as sexy mechanics. There are no fantasy elements in this world, other than the "magic" that happens between the sheets. ;) &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The camping trip from hell may be the first stop on the road to happily-ever-after.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Renzo Bianchi has a soft spot for Canaan Finley, and not only because the man makes a mean smoothie. He’s the first guy to get Renzo’s motor revving in a long time. But when he agrees to Canaan’s insane charade—one all-access fake boyfriend, coming right up—he never expects more than a fling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creating a hot Italian SEAL boyfriend to save face seemed like a good idea…until his friends called Canaan’s bluff. Now he’s setting off into the woods with the very man who inspired his deception, and Canaan is not the outdoorsy type. The sparks are already flying when a flash flood separates them from their group, leaving Renzo and Canaan very much trapped…very much alone in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working together to come up with a plan for survival is sexier than either of them expects. But back in the real world, being a couple is bringing its own set of hazards…</description>

  <description>Talia Spencer’s life is the epitome of boring and predictable. But then she meets him…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time she meets Casey Waltham, she’s buying condoms…for her grandmother. And of course drops them accidentally at his feet. Face plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time she sees him, she’s this close to landing her dream job and is celebrating at a club. Two chance encounters in the same day--that’s got to be a sign, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s charming and flirty and just what Talia needs for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was just supposed to be a hook-up.

  <description>Jonah: &lt;br /&gt;I’m the NHL’s toughest enforcer, the Body Checker, and I earned that title the hard way. I’m all about the game, a no attachment, no strings kind of guy, so when a puck bunny shows up at my door, shoves a pink bundle into my hands and drives off into the sunset, it turns my world upside down. I’m not cut out to be a family man. I know nothing about babies and I’m the last guy who should be taking care of one. But I do know someone who is equipped for the job—Quinn Reed, my best friend’s kid sister. Problem is, she kind of…hates me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quinn: &lt;br /&gt;Jonah Long…a father? Move in and help take care of his daughter? Crazy as that sounds, I agree to the temporary arrangement, for the child’s sake. Problem is, living with the guy I’ve crushed on since forever, is messing with my body as well as my brain. And now, watching him grow as a man, seeing the bond between father and daughter build, I can’t help but want this family for myself. But we’re just playing house, and Jonah isn’t interested in making this ready-made family the real deal…right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the stakes are this high, it’s game on. . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cam Brickley and his pro hockey teammates bet on everything: who can win five faceoffs in a row, who can do forty pushups in less than a minute, who can eat a ghost pepper without puking. But when his buddies bet him he can’t date the same woman—like, say, the hot blonde over at the bar—for two months and not fall in love, he’ll take that bet all day. Then he’ll laugh all the way to the hockey arena, where they’ll be washing his jock straps for the rest of the season, because Cam’s never giving up his bachelor lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Olivia Lockwood, heiress to the Lockwood Industries fortune, is used to people using her for her money and family connections. When Cam Brickley hits on her in a club, Olivia’s first instinct is to brush him off. But &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; couldn’t be using her for her money, since he has more than enough of his own. Cam’s gorgeous and built, and it would be no hardship to go out with him . . . besides, he’d be the perfect spokesperson for the children’s charity she works with. Maybe it’s time for &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; to start using people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cam and Olivia are both in it for something. What they don’t know yet is that they’re playing for keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Kelly Jamieson’s &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Aces Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MAJOR MISCONDUCT&lt;br /&gt; OFF LIMITS&lt;br /&gt; ICING&lt;br /&gt; TOP SHELF&lt;br /&gt; BACK CHECK&lt;br /&gt; SLAP SHOT&lt;br /&gt; PLAYING HURT&lt;br /&gt; BIG STICK&lt;br /&gt; GAME ON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s alluring reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT | LONG SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Game On&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Kelly Jamieson does it again with another ice-melting read. &lt;i&gt;Game On&lt;/i&gt; is all that!”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Heidi McLaughlin&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Savannah Orlando escaped horrendous abuse and torture at the hands of her father. As his trial approaches, she struggles to accept her newfound happiness with her husband, Damián, and to keep from falling back into old habits that once served her well, but no longer work. Nightmares and memories of the past threaten to destroy all she has gained since her escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damián Orlando knows her father will go to any lengths to destroy them, even from within custody. The need to protect Savannah wars with his need to prepare her to face again the monster who robbed her of her childhood innocence. If anything happens to Savannah, their daughter, or their unborn child, Damián will finish the job he started at the desert compound where he rescued her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman scorned and a politician with a wild side connect online—and explore their hottest fantasies in the flesh.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia Watts knows that her problems are painfully average. She got engaged, and her fiancé cheated. She gave up on her dream job—street photographer—and settled on a more practical one: graphic designer. She scrimped and saved to buy a home, only to realize how empty it was. So when Olivia hears about an exclusive dating app that matches subs with highly trained doms, she does something she never thought she’d do in a million years: She signs up. The last thing she expects to find is a man whose sizzling touch reawakens the woman she &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; to be. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Grant has no time for relationships. His sole purpose is to win reelection. That’s why he pays a premium to the discreet app that satisfies all his dark desires. But after sweet, innocent Olivia is vetted and arrives for their week together in his penthouse, it’s blatantly clear that she’s running from her demons. Noah’s more than willing to be her escape—until their emotions get tangled up in their games. Now, to become worthy of Olivia’s heart, Noah will have to prove that he’s more than a fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Quick-witted hustler Ghost is no stranger to living dangerously; survival has always been the name of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s just always gone it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s got the wrong people breathing down his neck, and the only way out demands placing his trust in the unlikeliest of heroes: Duncan Rook, a gruff cop whose ethics are as solid as his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cozying up to a criminal is hardly what Duncan’s reputation on the force needs—especially when that criminal is temptation personified. Ghost is Duncan’s polar opposite, and the last person he expected to fall for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then why does every imaginable scenario for taking down their common enemy end with Ghost in his arms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 122,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fast-paced contemporary romance that sizzles from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Order of Protection &lt;/i&gt;where passion for the law isn't the only thing heating up the courtroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isla Shayne knows she's in over her head. As former all-star linebacker Trey Adams's personal lawyer, she's used to handling his business dealings and private financial matters, not murder charges. She needs to find an experienced criminal attorney who speaks her client's language. David Cormack of Garrison, Cormack and Lawless is exactly what she needs in the courtroom--and the only man she wants in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For David, taking on the Adams case means diving back into a world he thought he'd left behind and colliding head on with tragic possibilities he's in no mood to face. There's a reason professional football is in his past and no matter how close Isla gets to the truth he intends to leave it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But long days working on the case together lead to hot nights in each other's arms. As their feelings grow, the case takes a deadly twist that could change the game between the two lovers forever.</description>

  <description>I'm a stick-to-the-rules, planning-it-all-out kind of girl. As a city event planner's assistant, my plan is to check off every box on my to-do list and make sure the Fireman's New Year's ball goes off without a hitch.Everything is in order. Until nothing turns out to be the way it is. Kissing Gabe Blanco, the sexy fireman with chocolatey eyes and a dirty mouth, was not on my to-do list, but now I can't think of anything else I would rather do. There was no way I could have planned on him, but he's tempting enough for me to throw caution to the wind.Temps might be dropping outside, but this OTT whirlwind insta-love will have you slightly hot under the collar.</description>

  <description>ASHTON &lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing I know, it’s how to play the game…both on and off the field. If it hadn’t been for that one teenage slipup where I kissed Beau Campbell, I’d be able to keep fooling myself. Football is the one thing I use to distract myself from the truth, and when I screw-up and lose the game I love, I find myself right back in Fever Falls. And right back face-to-face with Cranky Campbell, who hates me even more than he did when we were kids. Whatever magic he held over me then is still there. As much as I fight it, I still want him. And I always get what I want…well, except with Beau, who constantly calls me on my crap. Why do I like that so much? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BEAU &lt;br /&gt;I might’ve spent years watching Ash live out my dream—without the off-field antics and orgies with women, at least—but I’ve made a good life for myself. I’m a firefighter, and I coach my brother’s football team for those with developmental disabilities. But when Ash swings back into town armed with his monster ego and an arsenal of stupid nicknames, everyone is in awe of him. Nope, not me. I don’t care if our kiss years ago was responsible for my sexual awakening. I won’t fall for Ashton Carmichael. Though that resolution would be a whole lot easier if he wasn’t so tempting. Once he finds his way into my bed, I’m screwed—in more ways than one. But there’s more to Ash than meets the eye, buried beneath his ego, sarcasm and how we burn up the sheets together. Soon, it’s more than a game. We don’t just get each other fired up, we just might win each other’s hearts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad things are never that simple… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Daniel Black married the woman of his dreams in a whirlwind of love. She’s his entire world and sometimes he’s a little too obsessed with his wife. So when he discovers their marriage license has been deleted from the state’s records, he loses his mind. Someone in their lives is trying to sabotage his relationship with his one and only, and he’ll burn down the city to find out who it is. The only good thing about it is that now he can give his wife the wedding of her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blakely loves her husband and everything about their lives. The one thing she can’t seem to make work is her relationship with her father and her stepmother. She tries her best but it’s not good enough, and when they find out that her marriage to Daniel is invalid they jump at the chance for her to finally be rid of him. If there’s one thing she won’t do, it’s give up the man who worships the ground she walks on. She’ll marry him all over again, but will they support her decision?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Look, it’s Christmas, so we went full-on cheese-fest. This hero is hands down one of the craziest we’ve ever written and he’s so obsessed it’s scary. But during the most wonderful time of the year, isn’t that just perfect? Light up a yule log and cuddle up with this precious quickie!</description>

  <description>Kenny Haskell's hard work and determination finally paid off last season when The Baltimore Banners called him up from the minors. That doesn't mean the quiet defenseman is willing to stop proving himself. Each day is a new fight, a new opportunity, to prove to his coaches, to his team—and to himself—that he belongs with the Banners. Kenny is convinced he'll be able to keep his head in the game with no problems—until he gets thrown out of a youth hockey game by one unforgiving ref who proves to be more of a distraction than he anticipates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Gannon approaches life with a single successful mindset: take no prisoners, never give up, and always rely on yourself. At least, that's what she likes to think. The last year has been a little different. Being saddled with her younger sister who refuses to grow up and take responsibility for anything is turning Lauren's world into one crazy disaster after another. The last thing she needs to deal with is a professional hockey player who's too attractive for his own good—or for her sanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing Lauren has learned in life is to never underestimate the unexpected, and falling for Kenny definitely fits into that category. Can they really be friends and lovers? Kenny does his best to prove they can. But when a sudden family obligation forces Lauren to choose between what she knows is right and what she thinks is expected, will she find herself skating on thin ice and risking the happiness she really wants?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Nice to reconnect</strong><br /><br />A very sweet Christmas read. Lock and Key Christmas focuses on Grace, Miller and their son Thunder. <br />Although I would have preferred a little longer read......It ends at 50% ....It was still nice to reconnect with some of our favorite characters]]>

  <description>I did something over-the-top crazy! Not only did I have my first one-night stand, but it was with an older man. I even called him Daddy! I was on top of the world. A great job, amazing friends, beautiful new place all while riding the high of fun, kinky sex! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until I find out my mysterious older man is not only my new landlord but also my best friend’s dad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, I should walk away. I just can’t keep my hands to myself. But if you saw this Dilf, you wouldn’t want to either! What’s a girl to do? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Young nanny Anya Kozlov takes a job at the elite BDSM club, Wicked, in order to pay for her upcoming trip to Paris. Donning a mask to disguise herself she uses the fake name of Dove. On her first night she is shocked when she finds out that the man she is a nanny for and has an enormous crush on, Jesse Shaw, is also a member of Wicked. When Jesse expresses his interest in teaching her about the dark pleasures of Dominance and submission Anya is helpless to resist, even though she is lying to him about who she is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jesse can't seem to get Dove, out of his mind. It's been five years since his wife passed and for the first time he feels something beyond physical lust or friendship for a woman. He is angry and hurt when he finds out that Dove is really Anya, his meek and mousy nanny. With only a few weeks left before Anya leaves for Paris, Jesse is determined to get her to not only tell the truth, but also mark her heart and soul so that she doesn't forget him when they are an ocean apart.</description>

  <description>Whenever I’m within ten feet of Eve Cupid, all I can do is grunt and try to hide my erection. It’s not just the effect she has on my body. It’s the effect she’s having on my heart…and my soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s her smile. It’s the way her fingers dance on the piano keys. When she sings, the sound of her voice makes things happen in my chest I didn’t know were possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas, and all I can think of is how to get her under my tree. As luck would have it, she needs a Christmas tree and my family happens to own a Christmas tree farm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my holiday wish finally comes true, it’s gone as quickly as it came, because neither of us knows how to repair the sins of the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: Enjoy this holiday wonder with a grunty alpha, a kind-hearted girl trying to rebuild her life, and a whole lot of yummy sexy times under the twinkling Christmas lights. Always safe, no cheating, a little angst, and for sure a happily ever after for all. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Sloan Martinez wasn’t living her best life, but she was doing everything she could to get there. After her parents were arrested for embezzlement she was left penniless, so she borrowed a friend's car and decided to make some cash as a driver. It wasn’t the safest of jobs, but she didn’t have much choice. It wasn’t all that bad, until he got in one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harris Hill is a workaholic with no time for women. When the person pointing a can of pepper spray in his face turns out to be the woman of his dreams, suddenly things change. He’s obsessed with the young beauty who has stolen his heart, but she’s doing everything she can to build up her walls and keep him out. It’s just too bad he’s got a sledgehammer and he knows how to use it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This dirty delight is high-speed love with turns at every corner. There are car puns, surprise ball gowns, and an epilogue so sweet it will crack a tooth! Check your location because we’re coming for you!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Irresistible beats and tantalizing bodies heat up the night at South Beach’s most scandalous new club.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alex:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I hate doing business in clubs. Especially one like Duality. I’m here to seal a deal, not indulge in whatever hedonistic illusion they’re selling. Until, through all the skin and sex on display, I see her. Helen Blackwood. The girl who once filled my youthful fantasies, whose name is now synonymous with pain. Her father’s lies destroyed my family, leaving me with nothing to lose. And yet I can’t deny my electric response to her touch . . . or my urge to protect her when I see the bruise on her face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Helen:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Growing up, life prepared me for society galas and powerful men, not minimum-wage jobs or drunk exes with anger issues. But I’m a survivor. So here I am, practically naked, serving drinks at a Miami nightclub. I don’t mind the stares. Apparently, Alex Archer does. After twelve years, we aren’t exactly friends, but money is something we both understand. Something he knows I need. I’ll be his personal assistant, even if it means working with the man I hate . . . and the man I still want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No cheating. No cliffhangers. And no dress code.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss Sidney Halston’s Panic series:&lt;br /&gt;PULL ME CLOSE | MAKE ME STAY | KISS ME BACK | WHAT ABOUT US&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And look for all of her hard-hitting MMA romances:&lt;br /&gt;AGAINST THE CAGE | FULL CONTACT | BELOW THE BELT| LAID OUT | FIGHTING DIRTY | STACKED UP&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman scorned and a politician with a wild side connect online—and explore their hottest fantasies in the flesh.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia Watts knows that her problems are painfully average. She got engaged, and her fiancé cheated. She gave up on her dream job—street photographer—and settled on a more practical one: graphic designer. She scrimped and saved to buy a home, only to realize how empty it was. So when Olivia hears about an exclusive dating app that matches subs with highly trained doms, she does something she never thought she’d do in a million years: She signs up. The last thing she expects to find is a man whose sizzling touch reawakens the woman she &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; to be. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Grant has no time for relationships. His sole purpose is to win reelection. That’s why he pays a premium to the discreet app that satisfies all his dark desires. But after sweet, innocent Olivia is vetted and arrives for their week together in his penthouse, it’s blatantly clear that she’s running from her demons. Noah’s more than willing to be her escape—until their emotions get tangled up in their games. Now, to become worthy of Olivia’s heart, Noah will have to prove that he’s more than a fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A brand-new contemporary romance from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Head Over Heels&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The girl next door is the one that got away. He just doesn’t know it yet. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sawyer: After my wife died, I promised myself I’d never go through the pain of losing someone again. Now I keep my flings neat, tidy, and one-time-only. Besides, my son needs me more than ever. He’s miserable in our new town, so I’m pumped when he makes friends with the kid next door—until I recognize his mom from a one-night stand. Perky and upbeat, Elle Dunning is not my type for anything other than tearing up the sheets. So why do I keep letting myself get roped into game nights and get-togethers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle: It so hasn’t been my year. That’s my first thought when I see my new next-door neighbor. I never would have hooked up with Sawyer Paulson if my husband hadn’t left me for his high-school sweetheart, but because our eight-year-old boys have become best friends, I’ve got to make nice with Mr. Tall, Dark, and Silent. Yet the more time we spend together, the more Sawyer opens up. We’ve both been hurt—badly. So it’s one thing to send the kids off to sleepaway camp together. It’s quite another to promise each other a lifetime of sleepovers. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleepover is a standalone novel with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a satisfying happily ever after. This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.</description>

  <description>A struggling antiques collector finds herself falling in love with a millionaire playboy; but can she ever be a part of his world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the Naughty Princess Club, a series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Tara Sivec that brings readers to Fairytale Lane and the hilarity—and romance—that three women fall into once they decide to strut their stuff and bring on their own happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While her friends have broken free of their insecurities, Ariel Waters is struggling to come out of her shell. Her ex-husband took away her voice and her self-confidence, and Ariel is drowning under a sea of debt to afford the alimony she has to pay him. She refuses to ever fall for a man’s charms again, and is determined to make her own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her house and her beloved antiques are taken by the bank after too many missed payments, Ariel finds herself adrift until the infuriatingly charming Eric Sailor comes to her rescue. Although she can’t stand the millionaire playboy, Eric’s kindness and unconditional support reveal hidden depths and a love that Ariel never imagined she could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are outside influences who will stop at nothing to keep them apart; can Ariel and Eric weather the storm and find a way to be together?</description>

  <description>Quick-witted hustler Ghost is no stranger to living dangerously; survival has always been the name of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s just always gone it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s got the wrong people breathing down his neck, and the only way out demands placing his trust in the unlikeliest of heroes: Duncan Rook, a gruff cop whose ethics are as solid as his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cozying up to a criminal is hardly what Duncan’s reputation on the force needs—especially when that criminal is temptation personified. Ghost is Duncan’s polar opposite, and the last person he expected to fall for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then why does every imaginable scenario for taking down their common enemy end with Ghost in his arms?</description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog trainer Cara Bailey wants to find "the one," but fantasizing about her sexy-as-hell client, firefighter Travis Jansen, is getting in the way. Her only option? Get the confirmed bachelor out of her system-in every position possible-so she can settle down with Mr. Right. Starting right &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis doesn't do relationships, so no matter how badly he wants the pretty little brunette, he keeps his distance. Until Cara goes and changes the game. She'll fulfill all of his fantasies if he agrees to walk away when it's over. But when the wildfire between them blazes out of control, it will consume everything-and everyone-in its path...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It was supposed to be a quickie. Now there's a ring on my finger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you get if you mix a night in Vegas with a dash of some self-hate because your fiance ran off with your sister?&lt;br /&gt;An excuse to make some bad decisions.&lt;br /&gt;When my friends pulled me into the lap of a random guy at the club, I rolled with it. I played along because it felt good to let loose.&lt;br /&gt;I was single... I was angry... didn't I deserve a hot quickie?&lt;br /&gt;Then I woke up in the same bed as a sexy stranger—with a ring on my finger.&lt;br /&gt;He tells me that we're married. That I'm his wife, and he has no intention of letting me walk away from him. My mystery man with smokey eyes and a sharp smirk is used to getting his way.&lt;br /&gt;This was supposed to be some quick fun.&lt;br /&gt;Could one tiny mistake last a life time?</description>

  <description> Z’s day begins with sadness &lt;p&gt;A phone call from a dying friend leaves psychologist Zachary Grayson determined to fulfill the old survivalist’s request--a send-off that will comfort his grieving sons.&lt;/p&gt; And then turns deadly &lt;p&gt;The death threat is only the beginning…because the letter isn’t a hoax. Z walks out of his office into a barrage of bullets. He can take being shot at, but when the second shot splinters the empty child-seat in his car, he’s shaken to the core. The horror of what would have happened if his little girl had been there spurs him to action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master Z is a Dom, a husband, a father—every instinct drives him to protect those under his care. When the police can’t catch his stalker, he must take matters into his own hands.&lt;/p&gt; He must keep danger far from those he loves. &lt;p&gt;Secrecy and distance is the key. The funeral in Alaska is the perfect location, especially since Z won’t be alone. The survivalist’s sons have grown into men with lethal skills. With their help, he can trap the shooter and keep his family safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as his impetuous and all-too-observant wife, Jessica, doesn’t discover he’s using himself as bait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defiance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is not only a wonderful addition to the beloved &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Masters of the Shadowlands &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;series, but you also get to meet the sons from the upcoming &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sons of the Survivalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

It gives us a little more Master Z and Jessica and introduces us to the new characters perfectly. <br />The 3 of the 4 brothers are introduced and Gabe certainly stole my heart.

  <description>Keyes Dixon’s life is challenging enough as a full patch member of the Disciples of Havoc Motorcycle Club but being a gay biker leaves him traveling down one tough road. With an abusive past and his vow to the club cementing his future, he doesn’t believe in love and steers clear of commitment. But a midnight ride leads to a chance meeting with a sexy distraction that has him going down quicker than a Harley on ice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cocky Assistant District Attorney Alec Pierce lives in the shadow of his politically connected family. A life of privilege doesn’t equal a life of love, a fact made obvious at every family gathering. Driven yet lonely, Alec yields to his family’s demands for his career path, hoping for the acceptance he craves. Until he meets a gorgeous biker who tips the scales in the favor of truth and he can no longer live a lie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can two men from completely different worlds…and sides of the law…find common ground, or will all their desires only wreak Havoc? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Havoc is a stand-alone with no cliffhanger, the story continues early 2019.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cobi Mayson knows exactly who Hadley is to him the moment he sees her for the very first time. That doesn’t mean it will be easy for him to convince her to take a chance on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadley Emerson knows she could fall hard and fast for a guy like Cobi. A man who seems to show up every time she needs him, but she knows better than to just hand over her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing his future with Hadley is on the line, Cobi begins to tie their lives together. As the invisible rope that connects them tightens and things between them heat up, an unknown threat emerges threatening to to take away their happily ever after and send them both into darkness.</description>

  <description>Anya is getting ready to go to college, but she’s sad to leave her bodyguard behind. Sasha has been everything to her over the year, even more than he knows. She’s fantasized about all the ways he could do more than just protect her, and leaving him is making her heart ache. What she doesn’t know is he’s got his own plans, and they include more than she could have possibly dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sasha is the big Russian bodyguard everyone stays clear of. He’s intimidating, rough, and knows how to kill. But there’s a soft spot inside him, and it’s name is Anya. He’s made a promise to her father and to himself that he won’t touch her until he’s fulfilled his duty. But that time is almost up, and her innocence is free to claim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: We know how our readers love it dirty with a side of sweet so we’ve stolen a book from Jessa Kane, and added our own little sparkle to it. It’s the filthiest ever, so bring a spoon. You guys are going to eat it up.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Wyatt Malone had been ambushed! The little boy staring earnestly at him thought Wyatt was his new dad — and the boy’s pregnant mommy claimed to be his bride-to-be. The old matchmakers had gone too far this time and now it was up to Wyatt to tell Hannah Richmond and her adorable son that they’d been had by four well-meaning old cowpokes. Except that when Hannah looked at him like he was the best thing since sliced bread and made him feel like a complete man, Wyatt began to think that maybe the old fellas were right — and that could be dangerous for the whole town!</description>

  <description>Resisting her only makes him want her more...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Private investigator Billy Parrish is good at three things—fighting, investigating, and sex. MMA training with the other vets in the Warrior Fight Club keeps his war-borne demons at bay—mostly, and one night stands ensure no one gets too close. But then his best friend from the Army Rangers calls in a favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shayna Curtis is new to town and full of hope for the future. With a new job starting, she's grateful when her brother arranges a place for her to stay while she apartment hunts. But she never expected her roommate to be so brooding. Or so sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy can't wait for Shay to leave—because the longer she's there, the more he wants her in his bed. To stay. He can't have her—that much he knows. But when fight club stops taking off the edge, Billy lets down his guard…and starts fighting for what's his.</description>

  <description>There's sin, and then there's literally going-straight-to-hell sin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in lust with my dead brother's wife pretty much guarantees that one day I'll be the devil's bitch. But Eden Gordon works with me, so it's getting harder and harder to stay away. I promised my family—and him—I would, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My days as an MMA champion are behind me. But whenever I see her, with those wicked curves and soft mouth created for dirty deeds, it's a knock-down fight to just maintain my distance. "Hard Knox" becomes more than just the name of my tattoo shop. However, surrendering to the forbidden might be worth losing everything...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From&lt;i&gt; USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Caitlin Crews comes &lt;i&gt;A True Cowboy Christmas&lt;/i&gt;, the first in a sensational series debut about a cowboy, a farm girl, and the greatest gift of all. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gray Everett has a heart of gold but that doesn't mean he believes in the magic of Christmas. He's got plenty else to worry about this holiday season, what with keeping his cattle ranch in the family and out of the hands of hungry real-estate investors looking to make a down-and-dirty deal. That, plus being a parent to his young and motherless daughter, equals a man who will not rest until he achieves his mission. Now, all Gray needs is the help of his lifelong neighbor. . .who happens to have grown into a lovely, spirited woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Abby Douglas, the chance to join forces with Gray is nothing less than a Christmas miracle. Much as the down-to-earth farmer's daughter has tried to deny it, Abby's been in love with stern, smoking-hot Gray her whole life. So when Gray proposes a marriage of convenience as a way to combine land--and work together toward a common cause—Abby can't refuse. But how can she convince Gray that sometimes life offers a man a second chance for a reason. . .and that their growing trust and mutual passion may be leading to true and lasting love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; In the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;tradition of Lori Wilde and Carolyn Brown comes the first book in a new western romance series from Forever debut author Carly Bloom about a no-strings cowboy fling with a fairy tale twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who's afraid of the big, bad cowboy? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one too many heartbreaks, Travis Blake hung up his cowboy hat and put Big Verde, Texas, behind him. But when he gets the call that his young nephew needs him, he knows he has to return home. His plan is to sell the family ranch and hightail it back to Austin, but there's a small problem: the one person who stands in his way is the one person he can't resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie is pretty sure she hates Travis Blake. He's irritating, he's destroying her business, and . . . and he's just so frickin' attractive. But when they're forced to work together, Maggie discovers that the Most Annoying Man in the World is more than he seems. He's sweet with his nephew, he helps out in the community, and he makes her heart flutter. Maggie doesn't want to risk everything on a man who wants to leave, but what if she can convince this wayward cowboy to stay?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Gay Christmas Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hard-nosed military police officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One overly enthusiastic elf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One poorly timed snowstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a recipe for disaster? Or a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for holiday romance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy MacNally loves Christmas and everything that goes along with it. When he plays an elf for his charity’s events, he never expects to be paired with a Scrooge masquerading as Santa Claus. His new mission: make the holiday-hating soldier believe he was born to say &lt;em&gt;ho-ho-ho&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sergeant Major Nicholas Nowicki doesn’t do Santa, but he’s army to his blood. When his CO asks an unusual favor, Nick of course obliges. The elf to his Kris Kringle? Tempting. Too tempting—Nick’s only in town for another month, and Teddy’s too young, too cheerful and too nice for a one-night stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slow, sexy make-out sessions while Teddy and Nick are alone and snowbound, though, feel like anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; a quick hookup. As a stress-free holiday fling turns into Christmas all year round, Teddy can’t imagine his life without Nick. And Nick’s days on the base may be coming to a close, but he doesn’t plan on leaving anything, or anyone, behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 65,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when a single mother is forced to live with a grumpy, ailing football star? The smolder turns red hot of course.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Shaw has pulled it together. It’s taken a couple of years, a boatload of hard work, and a ton of self-discipline, but she finally has her problems in a headlock. Her yoga studio in the city has become so successful she’s opening one near the beach, and her relationship with her ten year old son is improving every day. The last thing she needs is a monkey wrench thrown into her smoothly running life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant Hendricks is one big monkey wrench. The four time Defensive Player of the Year, three time NFL sack leader, and all around football god has officially hit rock bottom. A devastating back injury means he may have to retire and that scares him more than doctors telling him the next hit could leave him paralyzed. All he needs is a quiet place to think and his teammate’s beach house sounds like just the place. Problem is, the woman already living there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You know the drill, folks. This book is chock full of naughty words and steamy moments. Not for delicate sensibilities and anyone under 18.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Nora Vaughn is living on the streets and trying to keep under the radar. Luck is on her side one day when the hot stranger she’s been watching drops his keycard and she’s able to get into a safe place. What she doesn’t expect is for him to find her naked in the shower and demanding she repay what she’s stolen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smith Prescott is a well-known judge who has worked his entire life to build a reputation. But one look at the young woman in front of him and he’s willing to throw it all away to have her. She’s forcing his hand and his iron will to do the things he’s sworn against. But what’s the point of having all this power if he can’t use it to have her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: This is quick and dirty and dripping with filth. If you love our books Coach, Mechanic, Thief, and Kingpin, then this one will give you all the feels you’re after. Enjoy some quality time in the judge’s chambers.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Not my AR read</strong><br /><br />I love Alexa Riley for their short, sweet and dirty stories but I felt Judge lacked the sweetness that most of their books have. <br />Her Uncle was a creep and I think Judge wasn't any better. I'm not opposed to Daddy/ little girl romances but this was a little off for me. ]]>

  <description>As sisters, they tell each other all their secrets...except one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With divorce and infidelity hanging from nearly every branch of her family tree, Katherine Fuller sees no point in marriage. Boyfriends? Sure. Sex? Of course. Wedding vows? No, thanks. Still, when her younger sister Amy gets engaged, Katherine gathers all the enthusiasm she can. She won’t let Amy down. She’s done enough of that for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sisters embark on wedding plans, Katherine’s college love resurfaces. It nearly killed Katherine to part from sexy Irish musician Eamon more than a decade ago, but falling under his spell a second time forces her to confront everything she hid from him. The secrets surrounding her mother’s death are still fresh and raw in her mind, but one has haunted her more than the others. She can’t bear to tell anyone, especially not Amy. It could ruin far more than a wedding. It could destroy a sister’s love forever.</description>

  <description>To Genevieve Rollins, Gavin Valentine has always been a casual hook-up. A no-strings fling. The sexy fighter pilot was only in town when he was on leave, so it could never be more than that. She didn’t have feelings for him. What would be the point? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when he tells her he’s moving home to Valentine Bay, she just may have to rethink everything between them. Can she dig down under her sassy, sarcastic shell and find true vulnerability inside? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Gavin Valentine, life has taken a turn. Diagnosed with a medical condition that means he’ll never be cleared to fly again, he loses everything that matters to him, pretty much overnight. The future he’d always seen for himself is gone in a blink. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can the lone wolf pilot open up enough to let love in, and learn that sometimes the future you never pictured is the one you were meant to have? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** Standalone romance with HEA and no cliffhanger *** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;18+ &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Alex Halford’s rock-star husband, Glenn, steals away in the middle of the night, leaving her with their two boys, a mountain of debt, and one person to turn to—his lifelong friend and band mate, David Callahan. David helps Alex pick up the pieces of her shattered life, happy to have any time with the woman he’s loved for seventeen years. Every moment with her is ripe with opportunity, and every last idea running through his mind would destroy his brotherly bond with Glenn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out from under Glenn’s thumb, Alex can see the person she was before marriage, finding feelings for David she thought she’d left behind in high school. A single kiss and the floodgates open, giving her new hopes of happiness. But when David and Glenn’s band has a chance to be back on top, David must convince Glenn to return. With every passing day, success comes closer, Glenn’s ego inflates, and David and Alex find it more difficult to hide. One misstep and the secret comes out, forcing David to choose between his life’s work and the woman he doesn’t want to leave behind.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brooding hockey hunk learns to embrace life—and love—from a single mom who takes the world one puck at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big move . . .&lt;/b&gt; Jodie's motto is "Don't wait for the perfect moment - take the moment and make it perfect." And that's just what she decides to do when she moves to Chicago with her two-year-old daughter. Now all Jodie needs is a place to live, and her best friend's boyfriend has just the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big stick . . .&lt;/b&gt; Nick Balachov has zero interest in socializing, partying, or flirting right now. It's not that he doesn't like women. He loves them. It's just that hockey, casual hookups, and hanging out at home are enough for him these days. Now Nick has a big problem - because the woman living in his empty coach house is a major distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big deal?&lt;/b&gt; The more Nick tries to keep his distance, the more Jodie needs him - around the house, that is. First he helps with the snowstorm, then the power outage. Nick even finds himself trying to impress her little girl. What the hell is wrong with him? Jodie represents everything Nick doesn't want. But maybe she's just what he needs. . . .&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a carefree single guy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A successful race car driver who enjoys hitting the track—hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t do commitments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hell, I rarely even do repeats. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until I spent the night with a gorgeous, funny woman who rocked my world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No names. No identifying details. Just lots and lots of pleasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until we meet up again at my older brother’s wedding. And guess what, she’s my brand new sister-in-law, Rylee Ford. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And apparently, now she hates me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and she’s also pregnant. Surprise, I’m the daddy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m so screwed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author’s note: Gage doesn’t start out as a single father... but it sure doesn’t take long for implantation to occur. &lt;i&gt;Pit Stop: Baby&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone romantic comedy with a HEA ending and no cliffhanger.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Stacey Kennedy comes the next riveting and sexy addition to the &lt;i&gt;Kinky Spurs&lt;/i&gt; series, &lt;i&gt;Sweet-Loving Cowboy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper McKinney finished culinary school with big dreams. Right now, she’s a bartender at &lt;i&gt;Kinky Spurs&lt;/i&gt;. While she’s content with her life, her brother is determined that she make a name for herself, because he wants her far away from what he deems a trashy bar. But Harper refuses to go anywhere. She’s in love with her brother’s best friend, Chase Blackshaw, and that love is keeping her in River Rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of Chase’s father, he’s the one responsible for running the construction of the Blackshaw Cattle Company’s guest ranch. Back in the day, he had dreams of opening a construction company, but lack of finances kept him working for the family’s cattle ranch. Now with the responsibility of his family’s guest ranch on his shoulders those dreams seem far away. Though he has bigger problems. His build is failing the inspections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Chase has more trouble on his hands. Harper, the woman he’s forbidden to ever touch has decided to move to Las Vegas. She isn’t so little anymore, and Chase is finding her all too tempting. She’s also not shy about what she wants. Him. Naked. And giving her some sweet lovin’ in all the kinky ways he craves. But neither Chase nor Harper can anticipate the fate that awaits them if they dare give in to their desires, as Chase soon learns there is something far worse than not being able to live out his dreams. It’s being given the chance to live out his dreams but having to watch Harper lose hers.</description>

And why she shouldn't take his wager. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryker Voss. &lt;br /&gt;Football star. &lt;br /&gt;Walks on water and God's gift to women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just ask him.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His crazy bet? He promises Penelope he’ll win her the heart of the guy she’s been crushing on. His plan—good old-fashioned jealousy. Once her crush sees her kissing Ryker, he'll realize what he's missing. Sounds legit, right? The only question is . . . why is Ryker being so nice to her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Penelope Graham. &lt;br /&gt;Virgin. &lt;br /&gt;Lover of sparkly vampires and calculus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His mortal enemy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Penelope knows she shouldn’t trust a cocky jock, but what’s a girl to do when she needs help getting a date? And Ryker’s keeping a secret, another bet, one that will destroy Penelope’s heart forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will the quarterback score the good girl or will his secrets mean everyone loses this game of love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a full-length standalone sports romance with a swoony, heartfelt HEA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*You do not have to have read &lt;i&gt;I Dare You&lt;/i&gt; first.</description>

  <description>Jean-Pierre "JP" Larocque is a speed demon for the Baltimore Banners. He lives for speed off the ice, too, playing fast and loose with cars and women. But is he really a player, or is his carefree exterior nothing more than a show, hiding a lonely man filled with regret as he struggles to forget the only woman who mattered? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Poole thought she knew what she wanted in life but everything changed five years ago. Now she exists day by day, helping care for her niece after her sister’s bitter divorce. It may not be how she envisioned her life, but she's happy. Or so she thinks, until JP re-enters her life. Now she realizes there’s a lot more she wants, including a second chance with JP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can these two lost souls finally find forgiveness and Break Away to the future? Or will the shared tragedy of their past tear them apart for good this time?</description>

  <description>Amber "AJ" Johnson is a freelance writer who has one chance of winning her dream-job as a full-time staffer: capture an interview with the very private goalie of Baltimore's hockey team, Alec Kolchak. But he's the one man who tries her patience, even as he brings to life a quiet passion she doesn't want to admit exists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alec has no desire to be interviewed--he never has, never will. But he finds himself a reluctant admirer of AJ's determination to get what she wants...and he certainly never counted on his attraction to her. In a fit of frustration, he accepts AJ's bet: if she can score just one goal on him in a practice shoot-out, he would not only agree to the interview, he would let her have full access to him for a month, 24/7. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a bet neither one of them wanted to lose...and a bet neither one could afford to win. But when it came time to take the shot, could either one of them cross the line? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Harland Day knows what it's like to be on rock bottom: he was there once before, years ago when his mother walked out and left him behind. But he learned how to play the game and survived, crawling his way up with the help of a friend-turned-lover. This time is different: he has nobody to blame but himself for his trip to the bottom. His mouth, his attitude, his crappy play that landed him back in the minors instead of playing pro hockey with the Baltimore Banners. And this time, he doesn't have anyone to help him out, not when his own selfishness killed the most important relationship he ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Williams' life isn't glamorous or full of fame and fortune but she doesn't need those things to be happy. She of all people knows there are more important things in life. And, for the most part, she's been able to forget what could have been--until Harland gets reassigned to the York Bombers and shows back up in town, full of attitude designed to hide the man underneath. But the arrogant hockey player can't hide from her, the one person who knows him better than anyone else. They had been friends. They had been lovers. And then they had been torn apart by misunderstanding and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some ties are hard to break. Can they look past what had been and move forward to what could be? Or will the sins of the past haunt them even now, all these years later?</description>

  <description>Carlos Santini has seen the worst of war first hand. After leaving the Marines, he decided to open a therapy ranch. If he can't fight anymore, he wants to help those who have served and who are still serving. Everything is fantastic, but for one little issue, his partner, Tia Mendoza. The woman is bossy, sarcastic, and so hot he can barely keep his thoughts straight around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tia loves the work she does with Carlos. She thrives helping other veterans like her brother. Of course, working for a man like Carlos isn't easy. He has a hot temper and he is so sexy when he loses it. She can't help but test him, until the day she pushes him too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos knows from that first kiss that Tia is the woman for him. But, before they can have that Santini HEA, they find the ranch they both love in danger from some very bad man. As the threats grow deadly, Carlos realizes that before he can claim his woman, he will have to do everything in his power to save her life.</description>

  <description>From award-winning author Erika Kelly comes the next book in her smoking hot series about four elite athlete brothers raised in the Tetons by their eccentric, billionaire dad and uncle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Bowie is supposed to be training for the Olympics, but the toddler unexpectedly dropped into his life isn’t interested in his schedules. Still, he’ll make it work. He has to. There’s no way he’ll bail on the little girl—not after his own mom ditched him twenty years ago. He’s pretty sure he’s got things under control… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…until a sexy chef lands on his doorstep and offers a temptation he can’t resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hours after losing her restaurant, chef Delilah Lua flies across the country to participate in a renowned cooking competition in the breathtaking Tetons. Winning would resurrect the dream that’s been stolen from her. If—no, when—she wins, she’ll go home with the capital to open her own place and enough fame to do it with flair. Her roommate, though, is a delicious surprise she hadn’t anticipated… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…but she’s not sure how to have her cake and eat it, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the undeniable sparks in the kitchen, Will’s not about to give his heart to another woman who’s leaving, and Delilah must decide if the delectable future she could cook up with Will is worth more than her lifelong dream.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SILAS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My home is my sanctuary. Or is it my prison? Some days it's hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've confined myself behind these walls for protection. I have my reasons, but that doesn't change the profound loneliness I've discovered in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I find myself drifting toward the window to see him. Corey Marshall, my new neighbor. Quiet, reserved, and cute as can be. He infects my thoughts, becomes the image I fantasize about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to taste his lips, smell his scent...feel what it's like to be inside him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And soon, watching becomes exchanging gifts and messages, which becomes so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's wrong to want this as badly as I do, but I can't help myself. I crave him so desperately. It's hard to tell if what we're doing is going to make me lose my mind or change my entire world, but it's too late to turn back now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COREY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never been quite right. Too high or too low. Pain is my constant companion...at the hands of my abusive ex, and often from myself. The sweet relief is only temporary, but in those moments, it's like I can finally breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I meet him. Silas Rizner calms the chaotic storms inside me. He makes me feel loved, treasured, even when I don't deserve it. I cherish the moments we share--cooking, cuddling, and when Silas reads to me until I fall asleep. When he's inside me, it's the only time in my life I've ever felt complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silas becomes the glue that holds me together, that bandages my scars. Inside the walls of his home, we're almost safe, but our demons are always there, waiting to break free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're a mess. We're broken, chaotic, beautiful; we're in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not even love can slay our monsters. No, only we can do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless our monsters destroy us first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;TRIGGERS: Self-harm, depression, anxiety, mentions of past domestic violence. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;My sweet captive doesn't like to be touched. She will learn. She no longer has the right to refuse.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She flinches at the sight of my scarred face, but the way she whimpers and trembles makes perverse pleasure stir within me. I captured the little FBI agent while she was trying to take down my drug empire, and I can't allow that. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pretty hostage possesses a stubborn streak and sharp mind, but her clever brain is no match for my iron will. I'll stop at nothing to claim her virgin body, no matter how many deviant punishments I have to devise for her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one will ever touch her again--especially not my cruel brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha is mine to keep and protect. Mine to play with and punish. All mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Claiming My Sweet Captive can be read as a standalone dark romance novel. It tells the events in Sweet Captivity from Andrés' point of view.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Not the dark romance I was hoping for</strong><br /><br />I love dark romance novels but this fell short for me. It started strong but there wasn't much of a story line. <br />There were some dark elements but it didn't keep me interested. Unfortunately I skimmed the second half of the book. ]]>

  <description>Twice Navy SEAL Curtis Lloyd has been ready to marry. Twice his bride to be has left him at the last minute for another man. So when a bride and her bridesmaid crash their car just outside Base Camp, in the biggest snowstorm this century, Curtis knows he has to get them to their wedding in Bozeman even if they have to walk the whole way. His motives aren’t entirely selfless: He needs a bride, too, in order to save the sustainable community he joined when he left the military, and feisty maid of honor Hope Martin is just the kind of woman he’d like to take to the altar.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A widowed father of two little girls. The beautiful nanny he's hired to raise them. A forbidden romance unlike any other. A Nordic King is the newest standalone royal romance from the New York Times Bestselling author of The Pact and The Swedish Prince.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I first applied for the job I thought it would be like all the others: working as a nanny for an aristocratic family. &lt;br /&gt;Then I got the job and found out how wrong I was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I’m the new nanny for two adorable little girls who happen to be princesses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their father is the widowed King of Denmark. &lt;br /&gt;And my new home? The royal palace in Copenhagen. &lt;br /&gt;Adjusting to my new life isn't easy but the hardest part hasn’t been the girls who still grieve over the loss of their mother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s their father. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cold, mysterious and moody, with an icy stare that seems to penetrate your soul, King Aksel may have hired me to take care of his daughters but he wants as little to do with me as possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet the longer I share these palace walls with this man, the more that I’m drawn to him. His chiseled face and sexual swagger are only part of the package. It’s in the long, intense glances at the dinner table, the way we’ll brush up against each other in the halls, the rare glimpses of the man deep inside, like the sun passing through clouds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But no matter how I feel about him, we can never be together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You think it's bad enough being in love with your boss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try falling in love with a king. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Nordic King is a 100% complete standalone story and a spinoff of The Swedish Prince and The Wild Heir. &lt;br /&gt;This book contains GRAPHIC SEX SCENES AND FOUL LANGUAGE - reader discretion is advised&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author &lt;b&gt;K Webster&lt;/b&gt;, comes a new MM &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; novel! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m used to being in charge. &lt;br /&gt;In the courtroom. In life. In the bedroom. &lt;br /&gt;But then I met him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He brings me &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; to my knees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome. Charismatic.

  <description>When Ivy goes to Las Vegas with her parents she never expects to wake up married to Deacon, one of her dad's best friends and her teenage crush. Especially considering the last time she saw him she'd kissed him and he totally blew her off. She thought he wasn't interested, but the ring on her finger says otherwise…now if she could only remember actually getting married. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Deacon has spent the last few years biding his time, giving Ivy a chance to grow up before he claimed her as his. One night was all it took to get his ring on her finger, and he'll be damned if he lets anyone keep them apart now. Something easier said than done when Ivy's parents find out he made their darling daughter his wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author's note- This novella is part of the Last Resort Motel series, but is a stand alone. Each story in the series is by a different author, of various genres. A bonus short story has been included for your reading pleasure!&lt;/i&gt;</description>
