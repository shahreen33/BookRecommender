  <description>&lt;i&gt;The secret passage to the house next door leads to a fascinating adventure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARNIA...where the woods are thick and cold, where Talking Beasts are called to life...a new world where the adventure begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digory and Polly meet and become friends one cold, wet summer in London. Their lives burst into adventure when Digory's Uncle Andrew, who thinks he is a magician, sends them hurtling to...somewhere else. They find their way to Narnia, newborn from the Lion's song, and encounter the evil sorceress Jadis before they finally return home.</description>

  <description>There are a thousand stories in the land of Narnia, and the first is about to be told in an extraordinary motion picture, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the never-ending war between good and evil, The Chronicles of Narnia set the stage for battles of epic proportions. Some take place in vast fields, where the forces of light and darkness clash. But other battles occur within the small chambers of the heart and are equally decisive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journeys to the ends of the world, fantastic creatures, betrayals, heroic deeds and friendships won and lost -- all come together in an unforgettable world of magic. So join the battle to end all battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second volume in&lt;br /&gt;The Chronicles of Narnia®&lt;br /&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narnia .... a land frozen in eternal winter ... a country waiting to be set free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four adventurers step through a wardrobe door and into the land of Narnia -- a land enslaved by the power of the White Witch. But when almost all hope is lost, the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, signals a great change ... and a great sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh is back in the shadows of a deadly, beautiful world where angels rule, vampires serve, and one female hunter must crawl out of the darkness to survive…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The severed head marked by a distinctive tattoo on its cheek should have been a Guild case, but dark instincts honed over hundreds of years of life compel the vampire Dmitri to take control. There is something twisted about this death, something that whispers of centuries long past…but Dmitri’s need to discover the truth is nothing to the vicious strength of his response to the hunter assigned to decipher the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savaged in a brutal attack that almost killed her, Honor is nowhere near ready to come face to face with the seductive vampire who is an archangel’s right hand, and who wears his cruelty as boldly as his lethal sensuality…the same vampire who has been her secret obsession since the day she was old enough to understand the inexplicable, violent emotions he aroused in her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As desire turns into a dangerous compulsion that might destroy them both, it becomes clear the past will not stay buried. Something is hunting…and it will not stop until it brings a blood-soaked nightmare to life once more…</description>

But he is more than happy to start a new and had what he had before he lost it. I am glad he wasn't to hard where he could not come back from it....]]>

  <description>Buffy's world goes awry when former-classmate-turned-vampire Harmony Kendall lands her own reality TV show, Harmony Bites, bolstering bloodsucking fiends in the mainstream. Humans line up to have their blood consumed, and Slayers, through a series of missteps, misfortunes, and anti-Slayer propaganda driven by the mysterious Twilight, are forced into hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Germany, Faith and Giles discover a town where Slayers retreat from a world that has turned against them, only to find themselves in the arms of something far worse. A rogue-Slayer faction displaces an entire Italian village, living up to their tarnished reputation as power-hungry thieves. And finally, with the help of a would-be demon lover, Dawn addresses her unfaltering insecurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Collects issues #21-#25 and the short stories "Harmony Bites" and "Vampy Cat Play Friend" from MySpace Dark Horse Presents!</description>

  <description>Willow and Buffy head to New York City to unlock the secrets of Buffy's mysterious scythe, when something goes terribly awry. Buffy is propelled into a dystopian future where there's only one Slayer -- Fray, the title character of Joss Whedon's 2001 series, the first comic he ever wrote. Their uneasy alliance falls apart, leading to the death of a major character from the TV series, while back in the twenty-first century, the Scotland base falls prey to a mystical bomb courtesy of the Biggest Bad-Twilight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The first two volumes of Buffy Season Eight have combined to sell over 160,000 copies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Includes the highly anticipated Buffy/Fray crossover, "Time of Your Life," and "After These Messages . . . We'll Be Right Back," written by Jeph Loeb (Batman: The Long Halloween).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Collecting issue #16-20 of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight series.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of THE GOOD GIRL, Mary Kubica is back with another exhilarating thriller as a widow's pursuit of the truth leads her to the darkest corners of the psyche. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"The bad man, Daddy. The bad man is after us." &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clara Solberg's world shatters when her husband and their four-year-old daughter are in a car crash, killing Nick while Maisie is remarkably unharmed. The crash is ruled an accident…until the coming days, when Maisie starts having night terrors that make Clara question what really happened on that fateful afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tormented by grief and her obsession that Nick's death was far more than just an accident, Clara is plunged into a desperate hunt for the truth. Who would have wanted Nick dead? And, more important, why? Clara will stop at nothing to find out—and the truth is only the beginning of this twisted tale of secrets and deceit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in the alternating perspectives of Clara's investigation and Nick's last months leading up to the crash, master of suspense Mary Kubica weaves her most chilling thriller to date—one that explores the dark recesses of a mind plagued by grief and shows that some secrets might be better left buried.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Technology controls almost everything in our modern-day world, from remote entry on our cars to access to our homes, from the flight controls of our airplanes to the movements of the entire world economy. Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can't always be said for the people who design them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer—the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed both gamers and his company's stock price. But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol's secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Computer technology expert Daniel Suarez blends haunting high-tech realism with gripping suspense in an authentic, complex thriller in the tradition of Michael Crichton, Neal Stephenson, and William Gibson.</description>

  <description>When Sovereign Solomon Nemamiah lay dying on a beach under an overturned vehicle with his fiancée helplessly sobbing next to him, he made a vow to himself that he would refuse to stay in some arbitrary afterlife. He silently promised to return and finish what he started with The Order of the Black Swan and the love of his life. When the new Sovereign of Jefferson Unit begins saying and doing things that remind people of Sol, it raises suspicion in the minds of people who were closest to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Mercy Renaux is a new hire archeologist seeking to change her life and find something to blot out the guy she can’t forget. Sir Rafael Nightsong, bad boy member of the infamous Z Team, is the guy she can’t forget. When his team is assigned to escort the recent recruit to Bulgaria on a mission to contain irrefutable evidence that vampire exist, they both wish they worked for somebody else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love a grand mix of romance, fantasy, science fiction, tears, laughter, and complex stories, this serial is right for you. 17+ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;named BEST PARANORMAL ROMANCE NOVEL of 2013, REVIEWERS' CHOICE AWARDS, the Paranormal Romance Guild.</description>

For a graphic novel I am sure invested in these, I have never experienced that before. I wish this one was a bit longer I felt as soon as we were getting somewhere that is when...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20627102-american-gods" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34941586-american-gods" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published in 2001, &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; became an instant classic—an intellectual and artistic benchmark from the multiple-award-winning master of innovative fiction, Neil Gaiman. Now discover the mystery and magic of &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; in this tenth anniversary edition. Newly updated and expanded with the author’s preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A storm is coming...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as Wednesday’s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined—it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.</description>

  <description>A phone call from an old friend sets Dr. Giovanni Vecchio back on the path of a mysterious manuscript he's hunted for over five hundred years. He never expected a young student librarian could be the key to unlock its secrets, nor could he have predicted the danger she would attract. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he and Beatrice De Novo follow a twisted maze that leads from the archives of a university library, though the fires of Renaissance Florence, and toward a confrontation hundreds of years in the making.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner BEST PARANORMAL ROMANCE Series four years is a row! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Reviewer's Choice Awards, The Paranormal Romance Guild&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duff Torquil is heir to Scotia, the kingdom of Fae, who have been at war with the Elves for two thousand years. Fae and Elves are both species who have evolved to respond to one fated lover with whom they will mate for life. Duff Torquil’s predestined mate is perfect for him in every way: beautiful, smart, polished, strong willed and a talented psychic who works for The Order of the Black Swan. The only problem is that she happens to be Aelsong Hawking, talented Black Swan psychic, younger sister of vampire hunter, Sir Rammel Hawking, AND the only daughter of the royal house of Elves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After escaping together to establish a quiet obscure life away from both families and the politics of elf/fae differences, the young lovers are captured, separated, secluded, and left to die as mated pairs of their species tend to do when permanently parted. Fortunately, an angelic intervention persuades the unlikely "powers that be" to get involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love a grand mix of romance, scifi, fantasy, paranormal, tears, laugher, and complex stories - this series is right for you. 17+</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nalini Singh steps back into the shadows of her “heartbreakingly original”* world where angels rule, vampires serve, and the innocent can pay the greatest price of all…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux and her lover, the lethally beautiful archangel Raphael, have returned home to New York only to face an uncompromising new evil…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vampire has attacked a girls’ school—the assault one of sheer, vicious madness—and it is only the first act. Rampant bloodlust takes vampire after vampire, threatening to make the streets run with blood. Then Raphael himself begins to show signs of an uncontrolled rage, as inexplicable storms darken the city skyline and the earth itself shudders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The omens are suddenly terrifyingly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient and malevolent immortal is rising. The violent winds whisper her name: Caliane. She has returned to reclaim her son, Raphael. Only one thing stands in her way: Elena, the consort who must be destroyed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Errant Dreams Reviews&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There are secrets in the town of Bon Temps, ones that threaten those closest to Sookie—and could destroy her heart...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sookie Stackhouse finds it easy to turn down the request of former barmaid Arlene when she wants her job back at Merlotte’s. After all, Arlene tried to have Sookie killed. But her relationship with Eric Northman is not so clearcut. He and his vampires are keeping their distance…and a cold silence. And when Sookie learns the reason why, she is devastated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a shocking murder rocks Bon Temps, and Sookie is arrested for the crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the evidence against Sookie is weak, and she makes bail. Investigating the killing, she’ll learn that what passes for truth in Bon Temps is only a convenient lie. What passes for justice is more spilled blood. And what passes for love is never enough...</description>

  <description>Growing up with telepathic abilities, Sookie Stackhouse realized early on that there are things she'd rather not know. An now that she's an adult, she also realizes that some things she knows about, she'd rather not see--like Eric Northman feeding off another woman. A younger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a thing or two she'd like to say about that, but she has to keep quiet--Felipe de Castro, the vampire king of Louisiana (and Arkansas and Nevada), is in town. It's the worst possible time for a human body to show up in Eric's front yard--especially the body of the woman whose blood he just drank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girl's fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, who's set out to make Sookie's world come crashing down.</description>

Since Sam Merlotte is now known to be two-natured, suspicion falls immediately on the anti-shifters in the area. Sookie suspects otherwise, but her attention is divided when she realizes that her lover Eric Northman and his "child" Pam are plotting to kill the vampire who is now their master. Gradually, Sookie is drawn into the plot-which is much more complicated than she knows...</description>

  <description>It's all about family ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a whole host of family problems, ranging from her own kin (a non-human fairy and a telepathic second cousin) demanding a place in her life, to her lover Eric's vampire sire, an ancient being who arrives with Eric's 'brother' in tow at a most inopportune moment. And Sookie's tracking down a distant relation of her ailing neighbour (and ex), Vampire Bill Compton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the multitude of family issues complicating her life, the werewolf pack of Shreveport has asked Sookie for a special favour, and since Sookie is an obliging young woman, she agrees. But this favour for the wolves has dire results for Sookie, who is still recovering from the trauma of her abduction during the Fairy War.</description>

  <description>The vamps have been out for years, and now the weres and shifters have decided to follow the lead of the undead and reveal their existence to the ordinary world. Sookie Stackhouse already knows about them, of course - her brother turns into a panther at the full moon, she's friend to the local were pack, and Sam, her boss at Merlotte's bar, is a shapeshifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great revelation goes well at first - then the horribly mutilated body of a were-panther is found in the parking lot of Merlotte's, and Sookie agrees to use her telepathic talent to track down the murderer. But there is a far greater danger than this killer threatening Bon Temps: a race of unhuman beings, older, more powerful, and far more secretive than the vampires or the werewolves, is preparing for war. And Sookie is an all-too-human pawn in their ages-old battle...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Dark Sword series unleashes the magic, passion, and fury of three legendary brothers—cursed by fate but bound by desire for the women they love...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Heart in Chains&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most reckless and fierce of the MacLeod brothers, Quinn is a prisoner of the god inside him, tormented by his inability to save his family from slaughter. His fury governs him, and day by day he loses himself to the darkness in his soul. But Quinn has a profound yearning for a woman’s love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Passion Unbound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised by Druids, the achingly beautiful Marcail is as spellbinding as the ancient magic that surges through her body. To Quinn, she is the most desirable woman he has ever known. But to his enemy, Deirdre, she is the perfect bait to lure Quinn into her trap. Once the two lovers are in her wicked grasp, their passion will be put to the ultimate test.</description>

      <![CDATA[This one basically picks up where 6 left off. Man Sabrina is a bad ass, but I hope she figures things out. I was worried when I didn't see another one after this that there weren't anymore but it left on a cliff hanger so there has to be more. Right? You see that Sabrina is meant for great things...]]>

  <description>The rite has existed for as long as anyone can remember: when the prince-who-will-be-king comes of age, he must venture out into the gray lands, slay a fierce dragon, and rescue a damsel to be his bride. This is the way things have always been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ama wakes in the arms of Prince Emory, however, she knows none of this. She has no memory of what came before she was captured by the dragon, or what horrors she has faced in its lair. She knows only this handsome prince, the story he tells of her rescue, and her destiny to sit on the throne beside him. Ama comes with Emory back to the kingdom of Harding, hailed as the new princess, welcomed to the court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as soon as her first night falls, she begins to realize that not all is as it seems, that there is more to the legends of the dragons and the damsels than anyone knows–and that the greatest threats to her life may not be behind her, but here, in front of her.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

  <description>A DANGEROUS SECRET…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallon MacLeod has gifts any warrior would covet - fierce strength, unmatched skill, even immortality. But those gifts come at a price that puts everyone he loves at risk. Only when his brother, Quinn, is taken captive does Fallon leave the seclusion of his Highland home to seek the king's aid. And though every women at court would gladly be his for the asking, one alone causes desire to roar to life within him: beautiful, mysterious Larena Monroe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WILD DESIRE…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors swirl around the castle about "The McLeod" but Larena knows the truth. Like Fallon, Larena is searching for a way to vanquish the evil Druid who wants to wreak havoc on earth. Drawn to Fallon in spite of her fear, she surrenders to a passion that shocks them both with its raw intensity. But Larena dares not hope for more - not when she holds a secret that could turn her fiery Highland love against her forever…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Don’t miss #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.R. Ward’s three-part ebook serialization: &lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell&lt;/i&gt;. This exclusive prequel to her upcoming standalone suspense &lt;i&gt;Consumed &lt;/i&gt;(available in October 2018&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; takes us back to where it all started between arson investigator Anne Ashburn and ‘bad boy’ firefighter Danny Maguire. &lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell&lt;/i&gt; is a sexy standalone novella that sets up C&lt;i&gt;onsumed&lt;/i&gt;’s storyline, leaving fans hungry for more and dying to snatch it up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell, Part 1: The Rehearsal Dinner&lt;/i&gt;: It’s a classic recipe for disaster: Take one bridesmaid who thinks pink is the root of all evil, mix with a best man who’s hotter than a four-alarm fire, add in their explosive sexual attraction, a nightmare bridezilla, two cat fights, and an emergency call, and you have the wedding from hell.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Experience the sizzling start of Anne and Danny’s intense relationship. Is this the start of something good...or just an erotic one-night stand that rocks their world, but must never be repeated?</description>

  <description>Elora Laiken broke Sir Storm’s heart when she chose his best friend. Now the handsome vampire hunter wants nothing to do with love or even women for that matter. Litha Brandywine is a witch who has other ideas. Like Storm, she works for The Order of the Black Swan and is known as the best tracker on earth. When he arrives at headquarters in Edinburgh, where Litha is currently assigned, she falls hard enough to be up for a test of wills. Though LItha might be perfect for Storm, he's hardened his heart and is determined that he won't be taking any chances on romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When B Team arrives in Edinburgh, the afterglow of an elftale wedding ends abruptly when Sir Kay's fiancé, Katrina, is kidnapped by a demon with a grudge. While the tracker, Litha, searches for the missing girl with Storm assigned as her escort, other members of B Team are tasked with bringing in a stray werewolf causing havoc in London and finding him a suitable new home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the popular Black Dagger Brotherhood series comes a brand-new novel about arson investigator, Anne Ashburn, who is consumed by her troubled past, her family’s scorched legacy, and her current case: chasing a deadly killer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Ashburn is a woman consumed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her bitter family legacy, by her scorched career as a firefighter, by her obsession with department bad-boy Danny McGuire, and by a new case that pits her against a fiery killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong-willed Anne was fearless and loved the thrill of fighting fires, pushing herself to be the best. But when one risky decision at a warehouse fire changes her life forever, Anne must reinvent not only her job, but her whole self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shattered and demoralized, Anne finds her new career as an arson investigator a pale substitute for the adrenaline-fueled life she left behind. She doesn't believe she will ever feel that same all-consuming passion for her job again--until she encounters a string of suspicious fires setting her beloved city ablaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danny McGuire is a premiere fireman, the best in the county, but in the midst of a personal meltdown. Danny is taking risks like never before and seems to have a death wish until he teams up with Anne to find the fire starter. But Danny may be more than a distraction, and as Anne narrows in on her target, the arsonist begins to target her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the creator of the bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood, get ready for a new band of brothers. And a firestorm.</description>

  <description>Released from the magic pokey and paroled with limited power is enough to make any witch grumpy. However, if you throw in a recently resurrected cat, a lime-green Kia and a sexy egotistical werewolf, it's enough to make a gal fly off the edge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention a mission...with no freaking directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I sit in Asscrack, West Virginia trying to figure out how to complete my mysterious mission before All Hallows Eve when I’ll get turned into a mortal. The animals in the area are convinced I'm the Shifter Whisperer (whatever the hell that is) and the hotter-than- asphalt-in-August werewolf thinks I'm his mate. Now apparently I'm slated to save a bunch of hairy freaks of nature?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they think I'm the right witch for the job, they've swallowed some bad brew.</description>

She disappeared to the South America, where she could fight both her savage gift and those who cursed her with it. Now, she needs Harry's help more than ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the vengeful Duchess of the Red Court has discovered a secret Susan has long kept from everyone--including Harry--and she plans to use it. To prevail, Harry may have to unleash the full fury of hi untapped power--and he may have no choice but to embrace the darkness within himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this time, he's fighting to save his &lt;i&gt;child&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jim Butcher's Breakthrough #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When it comes to the wizard's White Council, Harry Dresden is thought of as either a black sheep or a sacrificial lamb. And no one holds him in more disdain than Morgan, a veteran Warden with a grudge against anyone who bends the rules. But now Morgan is in trouble. He's been accused of cold-blooded murder--a crime with only one final punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's on the run, wanting his name cleared, and he needed someone with a knack for backing the underdog. So it's up to Harry to uncover a traitor within the Council, keep Morgan under wraps, and avoid coming under scrutiny himself. And a single mistake may cost someone his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like Harry...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Wizard Harry Dresden’s life finally seems to be calming down. The White Council’s war with the vampiric Red Court is easing up, no one’s tried to kill him lately, and his eager apprentice is starting to learn real magic. For once, the future looks fairly bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the past casts one hell of a long shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, calls in an old favor from Harry. Just one small favor he can’t refuse – one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally and strain his skills and loyalties to their very limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And everything was going &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; well for once….</description>

  <description>When dealing with demons, the devil’s in the details…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stealing mystical and arcane artifacts is a dangerous business, especially for a human, but Zoey Wharton is an exceptional thief. The trick to staying alive is having friends in all the wrong places. While having a witch and a werewolf on the payroll helps, being partners with a vampire really opens doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey and Daniel were childhood sweethearts until a violent car crash took his life and left her shattered. When Daniel returned from the grave as a vampire, his only interest in Zoey was in keeping her safely apart from the secrets of his dark world. He has vowed to protect her, but his heart seems as cold as the night he calls home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later, a mysterious new client named Lucas Halfer offers Zoey a fortune to steal the Light of Alhorra. The search for the Light leads Zoey into the arms of an earthbound faery prince. Devinshea Quinn sweeps her off her feet, showing her everything the supernatural world has to offer, but Daniel still calls to her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the true nature of the Light is revealed, Zoey discovers Halfer is a demon and much more than money is at stake. Per her contract, she must give him the Light or spend an eternity in Hell. What’s a girl to do except fight for her soul…and her heart.</description>

  <description>Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.</description>

  <description>There's no love lost between Harry Dresden, the only wizard in the Chicago phone book, and the White Council of Wizards, who find him brash and undisciplined. But war with the vampires has thinned their ranks, so the Council has drafted Harry as a Warden and assigned him to look into rumors of black magic in the Windy City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Harry adjusts to his new role, another problem arrives in the form of the tattooed and pierced daughter of an old friend, all grown-up and already in trouble. Her boyfriend is the only suspect in what looks like a supernatural assault straight out of a horror film. Malevolent entities that feed on fear are loose in Chicago, but it's all in a day's work for a wizard, his faithful dog, and a talking skull named Bob....</description>

  <description>Dangerous. Ruthless. Savage. And she's the good guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby Sinclair had a desperate childhood until she was rescued and adopted by a retired army ranger who molded her into a master of self-defense. Now, she's a cunning and fearless assassin thrust into assignment after dangerous assignment, using everything she has-nerve, resilience, strength, sex-to come out on top. Her only rule: trust no one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby's latest assignment is in Columbia: go undercover and snuff out a dangerous arms dealer active in the underground sex trade. But when Abby purposely blows her cover in a last-ditch attempt to free the helpless victims, deadly mercenary Kane Woodland is recruited as back-up. His mission: get Abby out of that hell hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Kane expects is to feel a primal attraction for Abby. But when she convinces him to join her on her perilous mission, their newfound passion could put the lives of their whole team at risk.</description>

  <description>The fourth book of the scream-worthy cult series The Merciless combines Stephen King level terror with true crime stories like the Amanda Knox case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ropes tighten on Berkley Hubbard's wrists. Blood drips down her fingers and lands with a smack on the cold floor of the church basement. She's trapped, bound, and petrified by fear. A knife punctures her fragile skin as Berkley's captors search for the mark of the devil on her body. They say they want to save her--drive the devil away and cleanse her soul--but will she make it out alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Berkley arrived in Italy a week ago, the last thing she expected was that she'd end up fighting for her life. After spending six months at the Institute, confined to a room with the dangerous-yet-alluring Sofia Flores, Berkley was certain that a vacation in Italy with her two best friends would be the perfect getaway. But Berkley is hiding a terrible secret, one that threatens to undo everything. As she's forced to face her wicked past, she learns that the devil is always watching, and no one is coming to save her.</description>

  <description>Brooklyn knows that there's no good without evil, no right without wrong. And when a helpless girl calls her teen helpline, whispering that someone is hurting her, Brooklyn knows that she needs to save her anonymous caller, even if it means doing something bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her parents and friends assure her the call was probably a prank but Brooklyn has always had a tendency to take over, whether someone has asked for help or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She discovers the call came from Christ First Church and finds herself plunged into the cultish community of its youth group. She's especially drawn to Gavin, the angelic yet tortured pastor's son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between an unstoppable attraction to Gavin and her obsession with the truth, Brooklyn is forced to make a devastating choice to rid Christ Church of evil once and for all. . . . But the devil has plans for Brooklyn's soul.</description>

  <description>USA TODAY BESTSELLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The explosive third installment in the Crossbreed Series by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling author Dannika Dark.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Raven Black, hunting criminals is second nature. So is denial. It’s not easy moving forward with one foot stuck in the past. But a new case offers her a much-needed distraction when Keystone accepts their toughest assignment yet—to track down an elusive criminal who’s selling children on the black market. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their investigation leads them deep into the underbelly of the Breed world, a place both treacherous and enticing. With no room for mistakes, Raven makes a tough decision to lock the door to her past before it interferes with her job. The only trouble? Christian holds the key. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stakes are high, and a shocking twist turns everything on its head. Will they catch this criminal before more lives are lost? Find out in the latest edge-of-your-seat installment of the Crossbreed series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“YOU MIGHT BE DONE WITH THE PAST, BUT THE PAST ISN’T DONE WITH YOU.”&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CROSSBREED SERIES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Keystone &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Ravenheart &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Deathtrap &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Gaslight&lt;br /&gt;Book 5: (TBA)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGERI SERIES (COMPLETE):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Sterling &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Twist &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 - Impulse &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 - Gravity &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 - Shine &lt;br /&gt;Book 6 - The Gift (Bonus Novella) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGERI WORLD NOVEL&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Risk &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SEVEN SERIES (COMPLETE):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Seven Years (Audie Awards Finalist) &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Six Months &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 - Five Weeks &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 - Four Days &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 - Three Hours &lt;br /&gt;Book 6 - Two Minutes &lt;br /&gt;Book 7 - One Second &lt;br /&gt;Book 8 - Winter Moon (Bonus Novella) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SEVEN WORLD NOVEL:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charming &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOVELLAS:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Closer &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“WE ALL HAVE SECRETS, RAVEN. DARK ONES. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.”&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after joining Keystone, Raven Black is ready to take on the world as a criminal hunter for hire. If only her partner wasn’t a bloodsucking Vampire with a penchant for getting under her skin. Despite her lavish surroundings, Raven misses the freedom of life without rules. And Keystone’s next assignment is about to test her self-control in more ways than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dead bodies are popping up in the human district, and all signs point to a Breed serial killer. In order to catch him, Raven and Christian embark on a mission that takes their partnership into uncharted waters. Lives are at stake. Can Raven trust her instincts, or will she fall into a web spun from lies and deceit? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time is running out in this pulse-pounding tale of dark secrets, murder, and forbidden desires.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book 2 in the Crossbreed series&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CROSSBREED SERIES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Keystone &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Ravenheart &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Deathtrap&lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Gaslight&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGERI SERIES (COMPLETE):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Sterling &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Twist &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 - Impulse &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 - Gravity &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 - Shine &lt;br /&gt;Book 6 - The Gift (Bonus Novella) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGERI WORLD NOVEL&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Risk &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SEVEN SERIES (COMPLETE):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Seven Years (Audie Awards Finalist) &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Six Months &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 - Five Weeks &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 - Four Days &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 - Three Hours &lt;br /&gt;Book 6 - Two Minutes &lt;br /&gt;Book 7 - One Second &lt;br /&gt;Book 8 - Winter Moon (Bonus Novella) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SEVEN WORLD NOVEL:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charming &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOVELLAS:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Closer &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With over 1 million books sold, USA Today Bestseller Dannika Dark introduces her next addictive series…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven Black hunts evildoers for fun, but her vigilante justice isn’t the only reason she’s hiding from the law. Half Vampire, half Mage, she’s spent years living as a rogue to stay alive. When a Russian Shifter offers her a job in his covert organization hunting outlaws, dignity and a respectable career are finally within her grasp. The catch? Her new partner is Christian Poe - a smug, handsome Vampire whom she’d rather stake than go on a stakeout with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're hot on the trail of a human killer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. One misstep during her probationary period could jeopardize Raven’s chance at redemption, and her partner would love nothing more than to see her fail. Will Raven find the courage to succeed, or will she give in to her dark nature?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark secrets, unexpected twists, and a blurred line between good and evil will keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The witch: supernaturally powerful, inscrutably independent, and now—indestructible. These moving, relatable poems encourage resilience and embolden women to take control of their own stories. Enemies try to judge, oppress, and marginalize her, but the witch doesn’t burn in this one.</description>

  <description>Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer – in case he or she decides to strike again.</description>

  <description>Dinner date after a hard workday should be heavenly. Of course, dates between the Beast Lord and Kate Daniels don’t always go as planned. Undead run amok, heads are chopped off, lawyers are deployed with extreme prejudice, and drunk vikings call people out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novella is after &lt;i&gt;Magic Slays&lt;/i&gt;, same time as Andrea in &lt;i&gt;Gunmetal Magic&lt;/i&gt;, both intersect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This novella can be found at the end of the Kindle edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12288282-gunmetal-magic" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gunmetal Magic.&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Paranormal investigations are Harry Dresden’s business and Chicago is his beat, as he tries to bring law and order to a world of wizards and monsters that exists alongside everyday life. And though most inhabitants of the Windy City don’t believe in magic, the Special Investigations Department of the Chicago PD knows better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karrin Murphy is the head of S. I. and Harry’s good friend. So when a killer vampire threatens to destroy Murphy’s reputation unless Harry does her bidding, he has no choice. The vampire wants the Word of Kemmler (whatever that is) and all the power that comes with it. Now, Harry is in a race against time—and six merciless necromancers—to find the Word before Chicago experiences a Halloween night to wake the dead...</description>

  <description>For Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, there have been worse assignments than going undercover on the set of an adult film. Dodging flaming monkey poo, for instance. Or going toe-to-leaf with a walking plant monster. Still, there is something more troubling than usual about his newest case. The film's producer believes he's the target of a sinister entropy curse, but it's the women around him who are dying, in increasingly spectacular ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry is doubly frustrated because he got involved with this bizarre mystery only as a favor to Thomas, his flirtatious, self-absorbed vampire acquaintance of dubious integrity. Thomas has a personal stake in the case Harry can't quite figure out, until his investigation leads him straight to Thomas' oversexed vampire family. Harry is about to discover that Thomas' family tree has been hiding a shocking secret; a revelation that will change Harry's life forever.</description>

  <description>Harry Dresden, Chicago's only practicing professional wizard, should be happy that business is pretty good for a change. But now he's getting more than he bargained for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A duel with the Red Court of Vampires' champion, who must kill Harry to end the war between vampires and wizards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional hit men using Harry for target practice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missing Shroud of Turin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A handless and headless corpse the Chicago police need identified...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the return of Harry's ex-girlfriend Susan, who's still struggling with her semi-vampiric nature. And who seems to have a new man in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some days, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. No matter how much you're charging.</description>

Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates.&lt;br /&gt;No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since his girlfriend left town to deal with her newly acquired taste for blood, Harry Dresden has been down and out in Chicago. He can't pay his rent. He's alienating his friends. He can't even recall the last time he took a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only professional wizard in the phone book has become a desperate man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just when it seems things can't get any worse, in saunters the Winter Queen of Faerie. She has an offer Harry can't refuse if he wants to free himself of the supernatural hold his faerie godmother has over him--and hopefully end his run of bad luck. All he has to do is find out who murdered the Summer Queen's right-hand man, the Summer Knight, and clear the Winter Queen's name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems simple enough, but Harry knows better than to get caught in the middle of faerie politics. Until he finds out that the fate of the entire world rests on his solving this case. No pressure or anything...</description>

Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Dresden’s faced some pretty terrifying foes during his career. Giant scorpions. Oversexed vampires. Psychotic werewolves. All par for the course for Chicago’s only professional wizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all of Harry’s years of supernatural sleuthing, he’s never faced anything like this: the spirit world’s gone postal. All over Chicago, ghosts are causing trouble—and not just of the door-slamming, ‘boo’- shouting variety. These ghosts are tormented, violent, and deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone—or something—is stirring them up to wreak unearthly havoc. But why? And why do so many of the victims have ties to Harry? If Harry doesn’t figure it out soon, he could wind up a ghost himself....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the back cover of ISBN 0451458443 / 9780451458445&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>They died with smiles on their faces. Three apparent suicides: a brilliant engineer, an infamous lawyer, and a controversial politician. Three strangers with nothing in common - and no obvious reasons for killing themselves. Lieutenant Eve Dallas found the deaths suspicious. And her instincts paid off when autopsies revealed small burns on the brains of the victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it a genetic abnormality or a high-tech method of murder? Eve's investigation turned to the provocative world of virtual-reality games - where the same techniques used to create joy and desire could also prompt the mind to become the weapon of its own destruction...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HARRY DRESDEN — WIZARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Dresden is the best at what he does. Well, technically, he's the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; at what he does. So when the Chicago P.D. has a case that transcends mortal creativity or capability, they come to him for answers. For the "everyday" world is actually full of strange and magical things—and most don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in. Takes a wizard to catch a—well, whatever. There's just one problem. Business, to put it mildly, stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the police bring him in to consult on a grisly double murder committed with black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs. But where there's black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that mage knows Harry's name. And that's when things start to get interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic - it can get a guy killed.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John Wayne Cleaver is dangerous, and he knows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's spent his life doing his best not to live up to his potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's obsessed with serial killers, but really doesn't want to become one. So for his own sake, and the safety of those around him, he lives by rigid rules he's written for himself, practicing normal life as if it were a private religion that could save him from damnation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead bodies are normal to John. He likes them, actually. They don't demand or expect the empathy he's unable to offer. Perhaps that's what gives him the objectivity to recognize that there's something different about the body the police have just found behind the Wash-n-Dry Laundromat---and to appreciate what that difference means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time, John has to confront a danger outside himself, a threat he can't control, a menace to everything and everyone he would love, if only he could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Wells' debut novel is the first volume of a trilogy that will keep you awake and then haunt your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has her hands full dealing with every sort of undead and paranormal creature imaginable. And after being betrayed by her longtime vampire love, Sookie must not only deal with a new man in her life—the shapeshifter Quinn—but also contend with the long-planned vampire summit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The summit is a tense situation. The vampire queen of Louisiana is in a precarious position, her power base weakened by hurricane damage to New Orleans. And there are some vamps who would like to finish what nature started. Soon, Sookie must decide what side she'll stand with. And her choice may mean the difference between survival and all-out catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with HBO's launching of an all-new show, &lt;i&gt;True Blood&lt;/i&gt;, based on the Southern Vampire novels, the demand for Charlaine Harris and Sookie Stackhouse is bigger than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The last volume of the fabulously popular A Series of Unfortunate Events series, in which the history of the Baudelaire orphans is brought to its end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are presumably looking at the back of this book, or the end of the end. The end of the end is the best place to begin the end, because if you read the end from the beginning of the beginning of the end to the end of the end of the end, you will arrive at the end of the end of your rope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been my solemn occupation to complete the history of the Baudelaire orphans, and at last I am finished. You likely have some other occupation, so if I were you I would drop this book at once, so the end does not finish you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adjusting to life as a world-famous cartoonist isn't easy. Terrifying deadlines, piles of junk-food wrappers under a glowing computer screen, and an ever-growing horde of pets....umm, never mind--it's pretty much the same.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With characteristic wit and charm, Sarah Andersen's third collection of comics and illustrated personal essays offers a survival guide for frantic modern life: from the importance of avoiding morning people, to Internet troll defense 101, to the not-so-life-changing futility of tidying up. But when all else fails and the world around you is collapsing, make a hot chocolate, count the days until Halloween, and snuggle up next to your furry beacon of hope.</description>

  <description>Magnus Chase has seen his share of trouble. Ever since that terrible night two years ago when his mother told him to run, he has lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits, staying one step ahead of the police and the truant officers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, Magnus learns that someone else is trying to track him down—his uncle Randolph, a man his mother had always warned him about. When Magnus tries to outmaneuver his uncle, he falls right into his clutches. Randolph starts rambling about Norse history and Magnus's birthright: a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more Randolph talks, the more puzzle pieces fall into place. Stories about the gods of Asgard, wolves, and Doomsday bubble up from Magnus's memory. But he doesn't have time to consider it all before a fire giant attacks the city, forcing him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die.</description>

  <description>Since Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has so few living relatives, she hates to lose one - even her cousin Hadley, undead consort of the vampire Queen of Louisiana. Hadley's left everything she has to Sookie, but claiming that inheritance has a high risk factor. Some people don't want her looking too deeply into Hadley's past, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; Hadley's possessions. And they're prepared to do anything in their power to stop her. Whoever it is, they're definitely dangerous - and Sookie's life is definitely on the line...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Meeting your soulmate? Great. Preventing your possible murder?&lt;/i&gt; Even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Clark, a Wyr and schoolteacher, has had two friends murdered in as many days, and she's just found the body of a third. She arrives at the scene only minutes before Gideon Riehl, a wolf Wyr and current detective in the Wyr Division of Violent Crime—and, as Alice oh-so-inconveniently recognizes at first sight, her mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the sudden connection Riehl and Alice feel is complicated when the murders are linked to a serial killer who last struck seven years ago, killing seven people in seven days. They have just one night before the killer strikes again. And every sign points to Alice as the next victim.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book contains a hot police detective, a violent murderer on the hunt, and a heroine that can blend in&lt;/i&gt; anywhere&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the latest Novel of the Elder Races, a Queen on the brink of sanity has no one to rely on except the Wyr warrior whose conviction is every bit as strong as his passion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save his friend's life, Wyr sentinel Rune Ainissesthai made a bargain with Vampyre Queen Carling—without knowing what she would ask from him in return. But when Rune attempts to make good on his debt, he finds a woman on the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, Carling's Power has become erratic, forcing her followers to flee in fear. Despite the danger, Rune is drawn to the ailing Queen and decides to help her find a cure for the serpent's kiss—the vampyric disease that's killing her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their desire for each other escalating just as quickly as Carling's instability spirals out of control, the sentinel and the Queen will have to rely on each other if they have any hope of surviving the serpent's kiss.</description>

  <description>In the walled city of Kos, corrupt mages can magically call forth sin from a sinner in the form of sin-beasts – lethal creatures spawned from feelings of guilt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taj is the most talented of the aki, young sin-eaters indentured by the mages to slay the sin-beasts. But Taj’s livelihood comes at a terrible cost. When he kills a sin-beast, a tattoo of the beast appears on his skin while the guilt of committing the sin appears on his mind. Most aki are driven mad by the process, but 17-year-old Taj is cocky and desperate to provide for his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Taj is called to eat a sin of a royal, he’s suddenly thrust into the center of a dark conspiracy to destroy Kos. Now Taj must fight to save the princess that he loves – and his own life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gritty Nigerian-influenced fantasy.</description>

But desire will bring both to their knees in this all-new Novel of the Elder Races.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the rule of her murderous Dark Fae uncle, Thistle "Tricks" Periwinkle found sanctuary among the Wyr in New York. Her ethereal beauty and sparkling personality won the hearts of the public, but after her uncle's death, there are those who don't want to see her ascend to the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Able to wield thunder and lightning, Wyr sentinel Tiago Black Eagle has ruled the skies for centuries. His massive build and thunderous power make him one of the Wyr's best weapons. And he's sent to protect Tricks when she's almost assassinated in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, both Tiago and Tricks will fall prey to the stormy hunger that engulfs them—a passion that will shake the very foundation of all the worlds.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the first book you found while searching for a book to read next, then the first thing you should know is that this next-to-last book is what you should put down first. Sadly, this book presents the next-to-last chronicle of the lives of the Baudelaire orphans, and it is next-to-first in its supply of misery, despair, and unpleasantness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the next-to-last thing you would like to read about are a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing alon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavory curry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next-to-last things are the first thing to be avoided, and so allow me to recommend that you put this next-to-last book down first, and find something else to read next at last, such a s the next-to-last book in another chronicle, or a chronicle containing other next-to-last things, so that this next-to-last book does not become the last book you will read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;With all due respect,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unflinching, darkly funny, and deeply moving story of a boy, his seriously ill mother, and an unexpected monstrous visitor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting-- he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd-- whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself-- Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</description>

  <description>Business has been slow. Okay, business has been dead. And not even of the undead variety. You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book. But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work, magical or mundane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brutally mutilated corpse. Strange-looking paw prints. A full moon. Take three guesses, and the first two don't count...</description>

  <description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Brandon Sanderson: his debut novel for the young-adult audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, Joel wants to be a Rithmatist. Chosen by the Master in a mysterious inception ceremony, Rithmatists have the power to infuse life into two-dimensional figures known as Chalklings. Rithmatists are humanity’s only defense against the Wild Chalklings—merciless creatures that leave mangled corpses in their wake. Having nearly overrun the territory of Nebrask, the Wild Chalklings now threaten all of the American Isles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the son of a lowly chalkmaker at Armedius Academy, Joel can only watch as Rithmatist students learn the magical art that he would do anything to practice. Then students start disappearing—kidnapped from their rooms at night, leaving trails of blood. Assigned to help the professor who is investigating the crimes, Joel and his friend Melody find themselves on the trail of an unexpected discovery, one that will change Rithmatics—and their world—forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Brandon Sanderson brings his unique brand of epic storytelling to the teen audience with an engrossing tale of danger and suspense—the first of a series. With his trademark skills in worldbuilding, Sanderson has created a magic system that is so inventive and detailed that readers who appreciate games of strategy and tactics just may want to bring Rithmatics to life in our world.</description>

  <description>Small-town cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has had more than her share of experience with the supernatural—but now it’s really hitting close to home. When Sookie sees her brother Jason’s eyes start to change, she knows he’s about to turn into a were-panther for the first time—a transformation he embraces more readily than most shapeshifters she knows. But her concern becomes cold fear when a sniper sets his deadly sights on the local changeling population, and Jason’s new panther brethren suspect he may be the shooter. Now, Sookie has until the next full moon to find out who’s behind the attacks—unless the killer decides to find her first…</description>

  <description>Orphan, clock keeper, and thief, Hugo lives in the walls of a busy Paris train station, where his survival depends on secrets and anonymity. But when his world suddenly interlocks with an eccentric, bookish girl and a bitter old man who runs a toy booth in the station, Hugo's undercover life, and his most precious secret, are put in jeopardy. A cryptic drawing, a treasured notebook, a stolen key, a mechanical man, and a hidden message from Hugo's dead father form the backbone of this intricate, tender, and spellbinding mystery.</description>

  <description>Grace Pizzelli is the average one, nothing like her brilliant older sister, Emily, who works for Rasmussem, creators of the world’s best virtual reality games. The games aren’t real, though—or at least they weren’t. Now Emily has hidden herself inside a pink and sparkly game meant for little girls. No one knows why, or how to convince her to come back out, and the technology can’t keep her safe for much longer. Grace may consider herself average, but she’s the only one who can save Emily. So Grace enters the game, hoping to talk her sister out of virtual suicide before time runs out. Otherwise Emily will die—for real.</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A CBS-TV SERIES LAUNCHING JUNE 30, 2015!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a lifetime, a writer puts it all together. This is James Patterson's best book ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For 36 years, James Patterson has written unputdownable, pulse-racing novels. Now, he has written a book that surpasses all of them. ZOO is the thriller he was born to write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All over the world, brutal attacks are crippling entire cities. Jackson Oz, a young biologist, watches the escalating events with an increasing sense of dread. When he witnesses a coordinated lion ambush in Africa, the enormity of the violence to come becomes terrifyingly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destruction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of ecologist Chloe Tousignant, Oz races to warn world leaders before it's too late. The attacks are growing in ferocity, cunning, and planning, and soon there will be no place left for humans to hide. With wildly inventive imagination and white-knuckle suspense that rivals Stephen King at his very best, James Patterson's ZOO is an epic, non-stop thrill-ride from "One of the best of the best." (&lt;i&gt;TIME&lt;/i&gt;)</description>

  <description>Things between cocktail waitress Sookie and her vampire boyfriend Bill seem to be going excellently (apart from the small matter of him being undead) until he leaves town for a while. A long while. Bill's sinister boss Eric has an idea of where to find him, whisking her off to Jackson, Mississippi to mingle with the under-underworld at Club Dead. When she finally catches up with the errant vampire, he is in big trouble and caught in an act of serious betrayal. This raises serious doubts as to whether she should save him or start sharpening a few stakes of her own ..</description>

  <description>The first victim was found lying on a sidewalk in the rain. The second was murdered in her own apartment building. Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas had no problem finding connections between the two crimes. Both victims were beautiful and highly successful women. Their glamorous lives and loves were the talk of the city. And their intimate relations with men of great power and wealth provided Eve with a long list of suspects--including her own lover, Roarke. As a woman, Eve was compelled to trust the man who shared her bed. But as a cop, it was her job to follow every lead...to explore every secret passion, no matter how dark. Or how dangerous.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are a slug, a sea anemone, or mildew, you probably prefer not to be damp. You might also prefer not to read this book, in which the Baudelaire siblings encounter an unpleasant amount of dampness as they descend into the depths of despair, underwater. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the horrors they encounter are too numerous to list, and you wouldn't want me even to mention the worst of it, which includes mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a dedicated author who has pledged to keep recording the depressing story of the Baudelaires, I must continue to delve deep into the cavernous depths of the orphans' lives. You, on the other hand, may delve into some happier book in order to keep your eyes and your spirits from being dampened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nico had warned them.&lt;/b&gt; Going through the House of Hades would stir the demigods' worst memories. Their ghosts would become restless. Nico may actually &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; a ghost if he has to shadow-travel with Reyna and Coach Hedge one more time. But that might be better than the alternative: allowing someone else to die, as Hades foretold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason's ghost is his mother,&lt;/b&gt; who abandoned him when he was little. He may not know how he is going to prove himself as a leader, but he does know that he will not break promises like she did. He will complete his line of the prophecy: &lt;i&gt;To storm or fire the world must fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reyna fears the ghosts of her ancestors,&lt;/b&gt; who radiate anger. But she can't allow them to distract her from getting the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood before war breaks out between the Romans and Greeks. Will she have enough strength to succeed, especially with a deadly hunter on her trail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leo fears that his plan won't work,&lt;/b&gt; that his friends might interfere. But there is no other way. All of them know that one of the Seven has to die in order to defeat Gaea, the Earth Mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Piper must learn to give herself over to fear.&lt;/b&gt; Only then will she be able to do her part at the end: utter a single word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heroes, gods, and monsters all have a role to play in the climactic fulfillment of the prophecy in &lt;i&gt;The Blood of Olympus&lt;/i&gt;, the electrifying finale of the best-selling Heroes of Olympus series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hazel stands at a crossroads.&lt;/b&gt; She and the remaining crew of the &lt;i&gt;Argo II&lt;/i&gt; could return home with the Athena Parthenos statue and try to stop Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter from going to war. Or they could continue their quest to find the House of Hades, where they might be able to open the Doors of Death, rescue their friends Percy and Annabeth from Tartarus, and prevent monsters from being reincarnated in the mortal world. Whichever road they decide to take, they have to hurry, because time is running out. Gaea, the bloodthirsty Earth Mother, has set the date of August 1 for her rise to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annabeth and Percy are overwhelmed.&lt;/b&gt; How will the two of them make it through Tartarus? Starving, thirsty, and in pain, they are barely able to stumble on in the dark and poisonous landscape that holds new horrors at every turn. They have no way of locating the Doors of Death. Even if they did, a legion of Gaea's strongest monsters guards the Doors on the Tartarus side. Annabeth and Percy can't exactly launch a frontal assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the terrible odds, Hazel, Annabeth, Percy, and the other demigods of the prophecy know that there is only one choice: to attempt the impossible. Not just for themselves, but for everyone they love. Even though love can be the riskiest choice of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the demigods as they face their biggest challenges yet in &lt;i&gt;The House of Hades&lt;/i&gt;, the hair-raising penultimate book in the best-selling Heroes of Olympus series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Annabeth is terrified.&lt;/b&gt; Just when she's about to be reunited with Percy—after six months of being apart, thanks to Hera—it looks like Camp Jupiter is preparing for war. As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the &lt;i&gt;Argo II&lt;/i&gt;, she can't blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon figurehead, Leo's fantastical creation doesn't appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's only one of her worries. In her pocket, Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving command: &lt;i&gt;Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me.&lt;/i&gt; Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to find—and close—the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabeth's biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he's now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader—but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated by four different demigods, &lt;i&gt;The Mark of Athena&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable journey across land and sea to Rome, where important discoveries, surprising sacrifices, and unspeakable horrors await. Climb aboard the &lt;i&gt;Argo II&lt;/i&gt;, if you dare. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Percy is confused.&lt;/b&gt; When he awoke from his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: &lt;i&gt;Annabeth&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hazel is supposed to be dead.&lt;/b&gt; When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her "gift" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frank is a klutz.&lt;/b&gt; His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning at the "other" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.</description>

  <description>In modern-day Britain, magic users control everything: wealth, politics, power—and you. If you’re not one of the ultimate one-percenters—the magical elite—you owe them ten years of service. Do those years when you’re old, and you’ll never get through them. Do them young, and you’ll never get over them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the darkly decadent world of &lt;i&gt;Gilded Cage&lt;/i&gt;. In its glittering milieu move the all-powerful Jardines and the everyday Hadleys. The families have only one thing in common: Each has three children. But their destinies entwine when one family enters the service of the other. They will all discover whether any magic is more powerful than the human spirit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have a quick ten years. . . .</description>

  <description>Here is the novel that started it all- the first book in J.D. Robb's number-one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling In Death series, featuring New York homicide detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas and Roarke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is the year 2058, and technology now completely rules the world. But New York City Detective Eve Dallas knows that the irresistible impulses of the human heart are still ruled by just one thing: passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. Further complicating matters is Eve's growing attraction to Roarke, who is one of the wealthiest and most influential men on the planet, devilishly handsome... and the leading suspect in the investigation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Everyone has a place.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khosa was born to be fed to the sea, to prevent the kind of wave that once destroyed the Kingdom of Stille. She can’t be sacrificed until she produces an heir, but human touch repulses her…except for the touch of the Indiri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dara and Donil are the last of the Indiri, a native race with magic that’s seductive—a force of nature—but dwindling since the Pietra slaughtered their people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witt leads the Pietra, the fierce warriors who are now marching on the Kingdom of Stille. The stone shores of Witt’s kingdom harbor a secret threat, and to ensure the survival of his people, he’s prepared to conquer every speck of Stille’s soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vincent stands to inherit the throne of Stille, but has no wife to share it with. When the beautiful and mysterious Khosa arrives without an heir, Vincent knows that his father will stop at nothing to make sure she fulfills her duty. Torn between protecting his kingdom and protecting the girl whose fate is tied to its very existence, Vincent’s loyalty is soon at odds with his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While royals scheme, Pietrans march, and the Indiri struggle to survive, the rising sea calls for its Given, and Khosa is destined to answer.</description>

  <description>Sarah Andersen's second comics collection picks up right where the first left off - huddled under a pile of blankets avoiding the responsibilities of the real world. These new comics (and illustrated personal essays!) follow the ups and downs of the unrelenting self-esteem roller coaster that is young adult life: budgeting woes, cramps, the nuances of sweater theft, and the joy of staying home all day with a box of pizza. All aboard.</description>

  <description>Zach, Poppy and Alice have been friends for ever. They love playing with their action figure toys, imagining a magical world of adventure and heroism. But disaster strikes when, without warning, Zach’s father throws out all his toys, declaring he’s too old for them. Zach is furious, confused and embarrassed, deciding that the only way to cope is to stop playing . . . and stop being friends with Poppy and Alice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one night the girls pay Zach a visit, and tell him about a series of mysterious occurrences. Poppy swears that she is now being haunted by a china doll – who claims that it is made from the ground-up bones of a murdered girl. They must return the doll to where the girl lived, and bury it. Otherwise the three children will be cursed for eternity . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Like handshakes, house pets, or raw carrots, many things are preferable when not slippery. Unfortunately, in this miserable volume, I am afraid that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire run into more than their fair share of slipperiness during their harrowing journey up--and down--a range of strange and distressing mountains.&lt;p&gt;In order to spare you any further repulsion, it would be best not to mention any of the unpleasant details of this story, particularly a secret message, a toboggan, a deceitful map, a swarm of snow gnats, a scheming villain, a troupe of organized youngsters, a covered casserole dish, and a surprising survivor of a terrible fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have dedicated my life to researching and recording the sad tale of the Baudelaire orphans. There is no reason for you to dedicate your-self to such things, and you might instead dedicate yourself to letting this slippery book slip from your hands into a nearby trash receptacle, or deep pit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;With all due respect,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The years have passed quickly for The Charmed Ones since they learned of their magical heritage. In only one decade they have experienced so much love and loss, joy and sorrow, failure and success. But time marches on and new challenges will be met as Phoebe is haunted by her past, Piper must deal with the present, and Paige is forced to cope with the future. But none of those events will prepare them to face the truth behind a family secret that could change everything for the Warren line</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Diabolic is ruthless. A Diabolic is powerful. A Diabolic has a single task: Kill in order to protect the person you’ve been created for. Nothing else.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nemesis, that person is Sidonia, heir to the galactic Senate. The two grew up side by side, and there’s no one Nemesis wouldn’t kill to keep her safe. But when the power-mad Emperor summons Sidonia to the Imperial Court as a hostage, there is only one way for Nemesis to protect Sidonia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She must become her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one of the galaxy’s most dangerous weapons is masquerading in a world of corrupt politicians and two-faced Senators’ children, and Nemesis must find within herself the one thing she’s been told she doesn’t have—humanity. With the Empire beginning to fracture and rebellion looming, that could be the one thing that saves her and the Empire itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dear reader&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word "carnivorous," which appears in the title of this book, means "meat-eating," and once you have read such a bloodthirsty word, there is no reason to read any further. This carnivorous volume contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn't mention any of the unnerving ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank, and Chabo the Wolf Baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly for me, my time is filled with researching and recording the displeasing and disenchanting lives of the Baudelaire orphans. But your time might be better filled with something more palatable, such as eating your vegetables, or feeding them to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;With all due respect&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you throw this awful book to the ground and run as far away from it as possible, you should probably know why. This book is the only one which describes every last detail of the Baudelaire children's miserable stay at Heimlich Hospital, which makes it one of the most dreadful books in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many pleasant things to read about, but this book contains none of them. Within its pages are such burdensome details as a suspicious shopkeeper, unnecessary surgery, an intercom system, anaesthesia, heart-shaped balloons, and some very startling news about a fire. Clearly you do not want to read about such things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sworn to research this story, and to write it down as best I can, so I should know that this book is something best left on the ground, where you undoubtedly found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mercy Thompson has found her voice in the werewolf pack. But when Mercy’s bond with the pack—and her mate—is broken, she’ll learn what it truly means to be alone...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Attacked and abducted in her home territory, Mercy finds herself in the clutches of the most powerful vampire in the world, taken as a weapon to use against alpha werewolf Adam and the ruler of the Tri-Cities vampires. In coyote form, Mercy escapes—only to find herself without money, without clothing, and alone in the heart of Europe... &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Unable to contact Adam and the rest of the pack, Mercy has allies to find and enemies to fight, and she needs to figure out which is which. Ancient powers stir, and Mercy must be her agile best to avoid causing a war between vampires and werewolves, and between werewolves and werewolves. And in the heart of the ancient city of Prague, old ghosts rise...</description>

  <description>The daughter of a prominent samurai, Mariko has long known her place—she may be an accomplished alchemist, whose cunning rivals that of her brother Kenshin, but because she is not a boy, her future has always been out of her hands. At just seventeen years old, Mariko is promised to Minamoto Raiden, the son of the emperor's favorite consort—a political marriage that will elevate her family's standing. But en route to the imperial city of Inako, Mariko narrowly escapes a bloody ambush by a dangerous gang of bandits known as the Black Clan, who she learns has been hired to kill her before she reaches the palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed as a peasant boy, Mariko sets out to infiltrate the ranks of the Black Clan, determined to track down the person responsible for the target on her back. But she's quickly captured and taken to the Black Clan’s secret hideout, where she meets their leader, the rebel ronin Takeda Ranmaru, and his second-in-command, his best friend Okami. Still believing her to be a boy, Ranmaru and Okami eventually warm to Mariko, impressed by her intellect and ingenuity. As Mariko gets closer to the Black Clan, she uncovers a dark history of secrets, of betrayal and murder, which will force her to question everything she's ever known.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have undoubtedly picked up this book by mistake, so please put it down. Nobody in their right mind would read this particular book about the lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire on purpose, because each dismal moment of their stay in the village of V.F.D. has been faithfully and dreadfully recorded in these pages. I can think of no single reason why anyone would want to open a book containing such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe Cell, and some very strange hats. It is my solemn and sacred occupation to research each detail of the Baudelaire children's lives and write them all down, but you may prefer to do some other solemn and sacred thing, such as reading another book instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>With shades of &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games, Ender’s Game, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Game of Thrones, &lt;/i&gt;debut author Pierce Brown’s genre-defying epic &lt;i&gt;Red Rising&lt;/i&gt; hit the ground running and wasted no time becoming a sensation. &lt;i&gt;Golden Son&lt;/i&gt; continues the stunning saga of Darrow, a rebel forged by tragedy, battling to lead his oppressed people to freedom from the overlords of a brutal elitist future built on lies. Now fully embedded among the Gold ruling class, Darrow continues his work to bring down Society from within. A life-or-death tale of vengeance with an unforgettable hero at its heart, &lt;i&gt;Golden Son&lt;/i&gt; guarantees Pierce Brown’s continuing status as one of fiction’s most exciting new voices.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have just picked up this book, then it is not too late to put it back down. Like the previous books in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, there is nothing to be found in these pages but misery, despair, and discomfort, and you still have time to choose something else to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the chapters of this story, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire encounter a darkened staircase, a red herring, some friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway, and parsley soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have sworn to write down these tales of the Baudelaire orphans so the general public will know each terrible thing that has happened to them, but if you decide to read something else instead, you will save yourself from a heapful of horror and woe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;With all due respect,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Dear Reader, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a story about cheerful youngsters spending a jolly time at boarding school, look elsewhere. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent and resourceful children, and you might expect that they would do very well at school. Don't. For the Baudelaires, school turns out to be another miserable episode in their unlucky lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, within the chapters that make up this dreadful story, the children will face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E., and the metric system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my solemn duty to stay up all night researching and writing the history of these three hapless youngsters, but you may be more comfortable getting a good night's sleep. In that case, you should probably choose some other book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope, for your sake, that you have not chosen to read this book because you are in the mood for a pleasant experience. If this is the case, I advise you to put this book down instantaneously, because of all the books describing the unhappy lives of the Baudelaire orphans, THE MISERABLE MILL might be the unhappiest yet. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to Paltryville to work in a lumbermill, and they find disaster and misfortune lurking behind every log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pages of this book, I'm sorry to inform you, contain such unpleasantries as a giant pincher machine, a bad casserole, a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be, a hypnotist, a terrible accident resulting in injury, and coupons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have promised to write down the entire story of these three poor children, but you haven't, so if you prefer stories that are more heartwarming, please feel free to make another selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all due respect,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not read anything about the Baudelaire orphans, then before you read even one more sentence, you should know this: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are kindhearted and quick-witted; but their lives, I am sorry to say, are filled with bad luck and misery. All of the stories about these three children are unhappy and wretched, and this one may be the worst of them all. If you haven't got the stomach for a story that includes a hurricane, a signalling device, hungry leeches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain, and a doll named Pretty Penny, then this book will probably fill you with despair. I will continue to record these tragic tales, for that is what I do. You, however, should decide for yourself whether you can possibly endure this miserable story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have picked up this book with the hope of finding a simple and cheery tale, I'm afraid you have picked up the wrong book altogether. The story may seem cheery at first, when the Baudelaire children spend time in the company of some interesting reptiles and a giddy uncle, but don't be fooled. If you know anything at all about the unlucky Baudelaire children, you already know that even pleasant events lead down the same road to misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, within the pages you now hold in your hands, the three siblings endure a car accident, a terrible odor, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a large brass reading lamp, and the appearance of a person they'd hoped never to see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bound to record these tragic events, but you are free to put this book back on the shelf and seek something lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The battle against a vengeful goddess reaches a climactic point as Lily Yu must now face the ultimate challenge in a dangerous new realm—without her husband, Rule...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mission to rescue five children stolen by an Old One falls apart under the assault of a demon prince, Lily wakes up in a strange reality—and is immediately taken captive by the dragon spawn who rule there. Jumping worlds has fractured her party, and Cynna is her only companion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the clock is ticking, time works differently, and Lily has miraculously gained a week. That means seven days to free herself, find Rule and the others, rescue the children, and make it home alive. All before the dragon spawn holding her hostage trade her to the Old One. It would almost be doable if this weren’t Lóng Jia—also known as Dragonhome: the birthplace of dragons.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This snippet takes place after &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1708120.Night_Season" rel="nofollow"&gt;Night Season (World of the Lupi, #4)&lt;/a&gt; and just before the free short story, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7926453-cyncerely-yours" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cyncerely Yours (World of the Lupi, #4.5)&lt;/a&gt;. It’s more of a scene than a complete story, but I thought readers who’ve enjoyed the series might enjoy listening in on Cullen’s counselling session with Father Michaels.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Seeing ghosts should make solving homicides easy, right? Not even close.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When detectives Maggie York and Josh Brandt catch a new murder investigation involving occult rituals, ghosts, and venomous snakes, it seems like a case that could only happen in New Orleans. Not only does the victim's ghost demand Maggie's attention, but three apparitions begin appearing to her...sending the detectives on a search for more bodies. They soon discover the ghostly trio has links to the Witching Hour Society, an organization of self-declared witches with far more going on behind the scenes. Meanwhile, a neighbor believes the victim killed his family with a curse, and the media eagerly sensationalizes the entire story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Making things worse, Maggie and Josh have hit a rough spot in their personal relationship. The tension between them is already high when Josh's ex-fiancée arrives in town...and wants him back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon the violence is escalating, the ghosts grow more aggressive, and the deeper Maggie and Josh dig, the stranger things get. Welcome to murder New Orleans' style. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kim Harrison returns to her beloved Hollows series with &lt;i&gt;The Turn&lt;/i&gt;, the official prequel to the series that will introduce fans and readers to a whole new side of Rachel Morgan's world as they've never seen it before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can science save us when all else fails?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trisk and her hated rival, Kalamack, have the same goal: save their species from extinction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Death comes in the guise of hope when a genetically modified tomato . Plague takes the world, giving the paranormal species an uncomfortable choice .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Under accusations of scientific misconduct, Trisk and Kal flee across a plague torn United States to convince leaders of the major paranormal species to save their supposedly weaker kin, but not everyone thinks humanity should be saved.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trisk fights the prejudices of two societies to prove that not only does humanity have something to offer, but that long-accepted beliefs against women, dark magic, and humanity itself can turn to understanding; that when people are at their worst that the best show their true strength, and that love can hold the world together as a new balance is found.</description>

I was sad that Trisk ended up where she did but I kinda saw it coming since I have read the main series, but it all works out for the best I guess. I thought Trent in the main series can be an...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;FBI agent Lily Yu’s mind is a dangerous place to be in the latest Novel of the Lupi…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the mindspeech lessons she’s receiving from the black dragon, Lily is temporarily benched from Unit Twelve—until her brain acclimates and the risk of total burnout passes. At least she has her new husband, lupi Rule Turner, to keep her occupied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her mentor calls in a favor and sends Lily to a murder scene, she’s suddenly back on active status—despite the hallucinations she can’t keep at bay. With one touch, Lily knows the man was killed by magic, but her senses don’t warn her how far the conspiracy goes…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shadowy force within the government wants to take Unit Twelve down, and they don’t mind killing to achieve their goal. With none of her usual resources, Lily is up against impossible odds–because with her mind in disarray, she can’t trust anything she sees.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In the newest Novel of the Lupi, the human and elven worlds are both about to come under attack… &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After questing through the sidhe realms with her ex-hellhound lover, Nathan, Kai Tallman Michalski has finally returned home. But she knows Nathan will eventually be called back to serve his queen—and Kai will have to decide whether to enter her majesty’s service as well. Sure, the job comes with great bennies, but there’s one big downside: she would have to swear absolute fealty to the Queen of Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For now, though, Kai is glad to be home, and glad that Nathan completed his mission for his queen with surprising ease. But what seemed to be a quick conclusion turns out to be anything but. The two of them helped thwart the sidhe god of chaos—and he is not happy about that. He’s got plans for them. Plans, too, for the sidhe who killed him some three millennia ago. Nor has he abandoned his plans for Earth, as they learn when chaos begins bursting out all over...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Eileen Wilks’s new Novel of the Lupi, FBI agent Lily Yu is about to confront a power even darker than magic…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On her 57th birthday, Lily’s mother suddenly loses all memory beyond the age of twelve. Lily knows her mother was attacked by something more than magic. More . . . and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lily and Rule discover that others suffered the same, mysterious loss—at the same time on the same night—their investigation into the darkness begins. Joining them is someone Lily never thought she’d see again: Al Drummond, who once tried to destroy her. He also happens to be dead. But the mysterious attacks were caused by a power strong enough to affect matters beyond the world of the living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some victims losing years of memory and others their lives, Lily must discover what on earth—or beyond—connects them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eileen Wilks' novels of the Lupi have drawn readers into a seductive world of action, suspense, and passion. Now, FBI agent Lily Yu tracks a traitor into the darkest shadows yet…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI agent Lily Yu is living at Nokolai Clanhome with her fiancé, lupi Rule Turner, when an intruder penetrates their territory, stealing the prototpye of a magical device the clan hopes will be worth a fortune--if a few bugs can be worked out . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the protoytpe can be dangerously erratic, discharging a bizarre form of mind magic—and it looks like the thief wants it for that very side effect. Worse, whoever stole the device didn’t learn about it by accident. There’s a Nokolai traitor in their midst. Lily and Rule have to find the traitor, the thief, and the prototype. One job proves easy when the thief calls &lt;i&gt;them--&lt;/i&gt;and his identity rocks Rule’s world.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they race to recover their missing property, they find Robert Friar’s sticky footprints all over the place. Robert Friar--killer, madman, and acolyte of the Old One the lupi are at war with--an Old One whose power is almost as vast as her ambition to rock the &lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt; world . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling sensation that has enraptured readers everywhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of Jocelyn's Butler's secrets are about to be laid bare...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the tan masculine hand up a long arm to broad shoulders and a face obscured by the sun beaming down behind his head. Tall, over six feet, the guy towered above me. I took in his expensive suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps in his late twenties or early thirties, the Suit had a twinkle in his eyes and a curl to the corner of his sensual mouth that, together with the rest of the package, oozed sex appeal. I could tell from the lines of the extremely well-tailored, expensive silver-gray suit that he wore that he worked out. He sat with the ease of a fit guy, his stomach iron flat under the white shirt. His pale blue eyes seemed bemused beneath their long lashes, and for the life of me I couldn't get over the fact that he had dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I preferred blonds. Always had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I 'm not sure I could walk away from an offer from him...</description>

  <description>Since being discovered as Soulless, Nadia has become a target for both terrorist groups and government corporations. Now, her only hope for survival rests in the hands of the man sent out to kill her: Diesel, the Mad Dog terrorist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diesel is determined to free himself of the never ending curse of reincarnation and the haunting memories that plague his mind. But when his search leads him to Nadia, a greater desire stills him from taking her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unable to see into Diesel's cracking mind, Nadia instead puts her faith into his strength, fueled by eleven generations of unmatched rage and insanity. Their tight-rope relationship balances the two between life and death, love and rage, trust and betrayal. &lt;br /&gt;Tension pulls at the hems of their dangerous companionship, and as time runs out all madmen must eventually make their choice.</description>

  <description>The planet is dying. Centuries of abuse have damaged the earth beyond repair, and now all the authorities can do is polish the surface, make the landscape look pretty to hide the disease within. Two prominent yet mysterious businessmen couldn’t fix it, either, but they did something even better. Together, they invented Chimera, the most complex and immersive virtual reality video game the world has ever known. The Cubes in which Chimera is played quickly became a fixture of this landscape: part distraction, part hospital, and almost wholly responsible for holding up the failing world economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miguel Anderson is also dying. He isn’t the only one who plays the game–everybody does–but Miguel has more reason than most: When players leave their Cubes for the day, the upgrades and enhancements they’ve earned for their virtual characters leave with them. New lungs to breathe poisoned air, skin that won’t burn under the sun are great and everything… but Miguel, born as broken as the earth, needs a new heart–and soon–if he wants any hope of surviving just a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the two Gamerunners announce a competition, with greater rewards and faster progression than ever before, and Miguel thinks his prayers have been answered. All he needs to do is get picked to lead a team, play the game he’s spent years getting good at, and ask for his prize when he wins. Simple, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, things seem to go according to plan. Mostly, anyway. Inside his Cube, with his new team–including his best friend–at his back, Miguel begins his quest. He plays recklessly, even dangerously, for someone whose most vital organ could give up at any moment, but his desperation makes him play better than ever. The eyes of the world are on him, watching through status updates and live feeds, betting on his chances. With greater rewards, though, come greater risks, and the Gamerunners seem to delight at surprising the competitors at every turn. As he ventures deeper into a world that blends the virtual and the real to an unsettling degree, Miguel begins to wonder just why the game was invented at all, and whether its stakes could be even higher than life and death.</description>

  <description>If high school is all about social status, Indigo Blackwood has it made. Sure, her quirky mom owns an occult shop, and a nerd just won’t stop trying to be her friend, but Indie is a popular cheerleader with a football-star boyfriend and a social circle powerful enough to ruin everyone at school. Who wouldn’t want to be her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a guy dies right before her eyes. And the dusty old family Bible her mom is freakishly possessive of is stolen. But it’s when a frustratingly sexy stranger named Bishop enters Indie’s world that she learns her destiny involves a lot more than pom-poms and parties. If she doesn’t get the Bible back, every witch on the planet will die. And that’s seriously bad news for Indie, because according to Bishop, she’s a witch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly forced into a centuries-old war between witches and sorcerers, Indie’s about to uncover the many dark truths about her life—and a future unlike any she ever imagined on top of the cheer pyramid.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Danielle Vega—YA’s answer to Stephen King—once again brings major scares in the spine-tingling sequel to horror hit &lt;i&gt;The Merciless&lt;/i&gt;, which MTV calls “&lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sofia is still processing the horrific truth of what happened when she and three friends performed an exorcism that spiraled horribly out of control. Ever since that night, Sofia has been haunted by bloody and demonic visions. Her therapist says they’re all in her head, but to Sofia they feel chillingly real. She just wants to get out of town, start fresh someplace else . . . until her mother dies suddenly, and Sofia gets her wish.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sofia is sent to St. Mary’s, a creepy Catholic boarding school in Mississippi. There, seemingly everyone is doing penance for something, most of all the mysterious Jude, for whom Sofia can’t help feeling an unshakeable attraction. But when Sofia and Jude confide in each other about their pasts, something flips in him. He becomes convinced that Sofia is possessed by the devil. . . . Is an exorcism the only way to save her eternal soul?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Readers won’t be able to look away from this terrifying read full of twists and turns that will leave them wondering, &lt;i&gt;Is there evil in all of us?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

This book definitely pulls you in many directions and I think maybe she could have gotten away if she just confessed everything. Because that is what was eating her alive was her guilt.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What would you do if the world was crumbling to pieces…and everyone believed you were the only person who could put it back together?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrorists have just bombed Disney World. A thousand miles away, a stranger shows up on Iris Spero’s stoop in Brooklyn. He brings with him a shocking secret about Iris’s birth, throwing her entire identity into question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, the press is confronting Iris with the wild notion that she might be the miracle the world now so desperately needs. Families all across the grieving nation are pinning their hopes on her as if she is some kind of saint or savior. She’s no longer sure whom she can trust—except for Zane, a homeless boy who long ago abandoned any kind of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When no one knows her but everyone wants a piece of her, who is Iris Spero now? And how can she—one teenage girl—possibly heal a broken world?</description>

  <description>This is an ACE for ISBN13:9780994383907 &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27315423.Soulless" title="Soulless" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soulless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Soulless.&lt;br /&gt;We are the generation that laughs at death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reincarnation; what was once considered a gift of immortality has become an eternity of nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadia Richards lives in a world plagued by reincarnation, a system of recycling souls where all past memories, personalities and traumatic events are relived daily in disjointed sequences. Trapped within their own warped realities, not even the richest and most powerful are saved from their own minds unraveling. Madness is the new human nature, and civilizations are crumpling beneath themselves trying to outrun it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a society that ignores death, Nadia appears to be the one exception to the reincarnation trap. Born without any reincarnated memories and with printless eyes, the hot tempered 19 year old quickly becomes the ultimate prize to all those wishing to end the vicious cycle, or for some, to ensure they could evade death forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers discretion: Adult language, violence and some adult scenes. For mature audiences only.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The more things change in Salem, the more they stay the same.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salem, Massachusetts is the site of the infamous Witch Trials and the new home of Samantha Mather. Recently transplanted from New York City, Sam is not exactly welcomed with open arms. She is a descendant of Cotton Mather, one of the men responsible for &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; Trials—and almost immediately, she becomes the enemy of a group of girls who call themselves The Descendants. And guess who their ancestors were?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If dealing with that wasn’t enough, Sam finds herself face to face with a real, live (well, technically dead) ghost. A handsome, angry ghost who wants Sam to stop touching his stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Sam discovers she is at the center of a centuries-old curse affecting everyone with ties to the Trials. Sam must come to terms with the ghost and work with The Descendants to stop a deadly cycle that has been going on since the first alleged witch was hanged. If any town should have learned its lesson, it’s Salem. But history may be about to repeat itself.</description>

  <description>When their too-adult lives lead them down self-destructive paths, these broken teens find a way to heal in this YA novel perfect for fans of Ellen Hopkins.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her impossible-to-please grandmother on her back about college and her disapproving step-dad watching her every move, Tessa would do anything to escape the pressure-cooker she calls home. So she finds a shot of much-needed power and confidence by hooking up with boys, even though it means cheating on her boyfriend. But when she's finally caught red-handed, she’ll do anything she can to cover up what she's done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack is a prankster who bucks the system every chance he gets—each transgression getting riskier and riskier. He loves the thrill, and each adventure allows a little release because his smug smile and suave demeanor in the face of authority doesn’t make life at home with his mom any less tough. He tries to take care of her, but the truth is he's powerless in the face of her fragile mental health. So he copes in his own way, by defacing public property and pulling elaborate pranks, though he knows in the end this’ll only screw up his life even more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they both try not to let their self-destructive patterns get the best of them, Tessa and Jack gravitate toward one another, discovering the best parts of themselves in the process. An honest portrayal of the urges that drive us and finding the strength to overcome them.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Let the world burn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an iron fist, the Great Library controls the knowledge of the world, ruthlessly stamping out all rebellion and, in the name of the greater good, forbidding the personal ownership of books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess Brightwell has survived his introduction to the sinister, seductive world of the Library, but serving in its army is nothing like he envisioned. His life and the lives of those he cares for have been altered forever. His best friend is lost, and Morgan, the girl he loves, is locked away in the Iron Tower, doomed to a life apart from everything she knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After embarking on a mission to save one of their own, Jess and his band of allies make one wrong move and suddenly find themselves hunted by the Library’s deadly automata and forced to flee Alexandria, all the way to London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jess’s home isn’t safe anymore. The Welsh army is coming, London is burning, and soon, Jess must choose between his friends, his family, and the Library, which is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone in the search for ultimate control…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the greater good requires the smaller evil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; 17-year-old Arman Dukoff is struggling with severe anxiety and a history of self-loathing when he arrives at an expensive self-help retreat in the remote hills of Big Sur. He’s taken a huge risk—and two-thousand dollars from his meth-head stepfather—for a chance to "evolve," as Beau, the retreat leader, says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau is complicated. A father figure? A cult leader? A con man? Arman's not sure, but more than anyone he's ever met, Beau makes Arman feel something other than what he usually feels—worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retreat compound is secluded in coastal California mountains among towering redwoods, and when the iron gates close behind him, Arman believes for a moment that he can get better. But the program is a blur of jargon, bizarre rituals, and incomprehensible encounters with a beautiful girl. Arman is certain he's failing everything. But Beau disagrees; he thinks Arman has a bright future—though he never says at what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, in an instant Arman can't believe or totally recall, Beau is gone. Suicide? Or murder? Arman was the only witness and now the compound is getting tense. And maybe dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mysteries and paradoxes multiply and the hints become accusations, Arman must rely on the person he's always trusted the least: himself.</description>

  <description>Some teenagers deliver pizza, some deliver newspapers. My part-time job? I deliver mysterious envelopes for a demon. I don't even get tips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a good deal at the time. I almost died in a car accident, and Azmos saved me... gave me a second chance. At first, it wasn't so bad. I got to live, go to high school, hang out with my boyfriend Cam. He's too cute for his own good, but he's getting tired of all this demon stuff. I hate lying to my best friend Melissa and my dad, who's still not over my mom's death. Neither am I. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, this gig is getting dangerous, and it's not like I can quit. Even if I could, then what? I've seen things I can't unsee. I just hope I can figure out how to navigate the darkness before I do something I can't undo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time I face my own demons.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No matter how much the paranormal politics of Atlanta change, one thing always remains the same: if there’s trouble, Kate Daniels will be in the middle of it…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mate of the Beast Lord, Curran, former mercenary Kate Daniels has more responsibilities than it seems possible to juggle. Not only is she still struggling to keep her investigative business afloat, she must now deal with the affairs of the pack, including preparing her people for attack from Roland, a cruel ancient being with god-like powers. Since Kate’s connection to Roland has come out into the open, no one is safe—especially those closest to Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Roland’s long shadow looms ever nearer, Kate is called to attend the Conclave, a gathering of the leaders from the various supernatural factions in Atlanta. When one of the Masters of the Dead is found murdered there, apparently at the hands of a shapeshifter, Kate is given only twenty-four hours to hunt down the killer. And this time, if she fails, she’ll find herself embroiled in a war which could destroy everything she holds dear…</description>

As Andrea’s search for the killer leads her into the secret underbelly of supernatural Atlanta, she knows that dealing with her feelings for Raphael might have to take a back seat to saving the world…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes "Magic Gifts"--a bonus Kate Daniels novella</description>

  <description>Lead me not into temptation.&lt;br /&gt;Follow me instead! I know a shortcut!&lt;br /&gt;--T-shirt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve. Twelve of the deadliest beasts ever forged in the fires of hell have escaped onto our plane, and they want nothing more than to rip out Charley Davidson's jugular and serve her body to Satan for dinner. So there's that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Charley has more on her plate than a mob of testy hellhounds. For one thing, her father has disappeared, and as she retraces his last steps she learns he was conducting an investigation of his own, one that has Charley questioning everything she's ever known about him. Add to that an ex-BFF who is haunting her night and day, a rash of suicides that has authorities baffled, and a drop-dead sexy fiancé who has attracted the attentions of a local celebrity, and Charley is not having the best week of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of that barely scratches the surface of her problems. Recent developments have forced her to become a responsible adult. To conquer such a monumental task, she's decided to start small. Really small. She gets a pet. But how can she save the world against the forces of evil when she can't even keep a goldfish alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad north of hell, a hop, skip, and a jump past the realm of eternity, is a little place called Earth, and Charley Davidson, grim reaper extraordinaire, is determined to do everything in her power to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're doomed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place.&lt;/b&gt; The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

  <description>It was white. Maybe that’s why she immediately thought ghost. It drifted on a diagonal like three-dimensional rice paper—translucent, not transparent, its edges too clearly defined for smoke, its shape vaguely human but faceless. It floated on a steady, nonexistent air current, starting at the left-rear of the range . . . and coming straight at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quick clamp of fear, irrational and immediate, stiffened her spine as it widened her eyes. As the thing floated closer it stretched out a hand—and yes, it was a hand.

  <description>Lily Yu and Rule Turner’s engagement announcement is stirring up ugly passions in the Humans First camp. There’s hate mail. Death threats. Lily’s car is vandalized. But professionally, things are going smoothly...until a lupus in Tennessee goes on a killing spree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Rule's brother, Benedict, catches a lovely intruder--twice. The first time she's sneaking around the home of the leader of Humans First. The second time, she sneaks into Nokolai Clanhome with a mysterious potion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be possible to deal with the rapidly escalating situation the way Lily always has: through the law. Especially when she’s pulled off the case due to an alleged conflict of interest. Lily’s loyalties will be stretched to the breaking point when she discovers that the deaths in Tennessee were only the opening skirmish in an all-out war.</description>

  <description>Reyes is a man possessed. Bound by the demon of pain, he is forbidden to know pleasure. Yet he craves a mortal woman, Danika Ford, more than breath and will do anything to claim her—even defy the gods. Danika is on the run. For months she's eluded the Lords of the Underworld, immortal warriors who won't rest until she and her family have been destroyed. But her dreams are haunted by Reyes, the warrior whose searing touch she can't forget. Yet a future together could mean death to all they both hold dear....</description>

Until now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though she has lived for centuries, Anya, goddess of Anarchy, has never known pleasure.

  <description>Lindi Parker works hard at being human, not an easy task for a weresnake. She has no desire to search for others like her—until a new case changes everything. When Lindi learns that she's not the only shapeshifter in the world, she realizes she might be next on a killer's list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save herself and the abused children she works with, she will have to team up with Dr. Kade Nevala, a member of the shifter tribe responsible for eradicating weresnakes—and the most attractive man Lindi's ever met. Even more terrifying, she’ll need to embrace her serpent side, a choice that has enormous consequences for Lindi, and for everyone around her.</description>

  <description>FBI agent Lily Yu is in North Carolina with her lover and mate, Rule Turner, Lu Nuncio of the Nokolai werewolf clan. He is there to take custody of his son from the boy's grandmother. It's a purely personal trip until Rule, in wolf form, finds three bodies in a shallow grave. They carry the stench of death magic, which makes the murders a federal crime. Lily takes charge of the investigation and soon realizes that nothing adds up- not the motives or the main suspect, who is behind bars when death strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But murder, however bizarre, is an everyday affair for Lily, who was a homicide cop before being recruited into the FBI's Magical Crimes Division. A more personal shock arrives in the form of Rule's son's mother. Why would she now challenge Rule's plan to bring his son to live among the Nokolai? But family matters must take a backseat when the violence escalates, and there's no rhyme or reason for the next strike- by a killer who may not even be of this world.</description>

  <description>This is a scene that didn’t make it into the final version of BLOOD LINES , but was originally part of the prologue. It's numbered as #2.9 since it should be read directly before reading BLOOD LINES.</description>

  <description>This short story takes places in Rule's past, specifically January 10, 1976 during his Sophomore year of high school in a small town near Clanhome.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Plagued by a war between magic and technology, Atlanta has never been so deadly. Good thing Kate Daniels is on the job.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Daniels may have quit the Order of Merciful Aid, but she’s still knee-deep in paranormal problems. Or she would be if she could get someone to hire her. Starting her own business has been more challenging than she thought it would be—now that the Order is disparaging her good name. Plus, many potential clients are afraid of getting on the bad side of the Beast Lord, who just happens to be Kate’s mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Atlanta’s premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. But it turns out that this is not an isolated incident. Kate needs to get to the bottom of it—and fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price…</description>

Now, read the eSpecial, Buying Trouble, the companion novella to Midnight’s Daughter, and learn why vampires aren't the only creatures to fear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire just wants to keep out of trouble.

  <description>Certain people in Midland, Texas, are dying. All of them were Gifted, and all of them have been drained of their blood. Kai is a reluctant telepath with a skewed Gift—she sees thoughts instead of experiencing them. So, unlike other Midlanders, she can intuit that they have a “Guardian.” She also knows that the Guardian Nathan isn’t human. His true nature hasn’t been divined. Neither has hers. But when another one of the Gifted is found dead, Kai herself becomes a suspect. And only Nathan can save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published in On the Prowl.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Cry Wolf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Patricia Briggs started a new urban fantasy series set in the world of Mercy Thompson — but with rules of its own. Now, read "Alpha and Omega," the novella that inspired the new series, and see how it all began...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Latham never knew werewolves existed, until the night she survived a violent attack... and became one herself. After three years at the bottom of the Chicago pack, she's learned to keep her head down and never, ever trust dominant males. But when she discovers wrongdoing in her pack, she has to go above her Alpha's head to ask for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Cornick is the son — and enforcer — of the leader of the North American werewolves. Now his father has sent him to Chicago to clean up a problem there. Charles never expected to find Anna, a rare Omega wolf — and he certainly never expected to recognize her as his mate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novella was originally published in the anthology, &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;On the Prowl.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>A Maggie York Paranormal Mystery Book One &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not believing won't make the ghosts go away.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New Orleans' homicide cop Maggie York is at the top of her game until a sniper's bullet changes everything. She flatlines, comes back. But not quite the same. She sees and hears things...ghostly things. And she blurts out enough to her doctors to end up on medical leave with a diagnosis of PTSD. If only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six months later, the voices have faded and the ghostly sightings are less frequent. The department still won't let Maggie return to the job. Oh, she's quit talking about ghosts, except to a few friends and the loony relatives who believe she's a witch, but Maggie doubts herself. Since inactivity is making it worse, she sets out to track down her shooter, only things get complicated...a ghostly witness wants his own murder solved, and sexy homicide cop, Josh Brandt—who just happens to be her replacement—wants her to butt out of his case. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After Josh catches her at the murder scene of a key witness, he wonders how the attractive redhead is staying one step ahead of him and how deeply her involvement goes. She doesn't appear as unstable as he's been told, but she's hiding something. He recognizes the signs...because he has secrets of his own. Unraveling her case soon draws them down twisted but intersecting paths. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And failure may cost Maggie her life. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Pregnancy has turned FBI Agent Cynna Weaver's whole life upside down. Lupus sorcerer Cullen Seabourne is thrilled to be a father, but what does Cynna know about kids? Her mother was a drunk and her father abandoned his family. Or so she's always believed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Cynna is trying to wrap her head around this problem, a new one pops up in the form of a delegation from another realm. They want to take Cynna and Cullen back with them- to meet her long-lost father and find a mysterious medallion. But when these two born cynics land in a world where magic is common-place and night never ends, their only way home lies in tracking down the missing medallion- one also sought by powerful beings who will do anything to claim it.</description>

      <![CDATA[At first I was afraid I wasn't going to like this one as much as the other but I actually enjoyed it a lot. I like Cynna and Cullen.... well he can be okay in doses he is sweet though and shows his love rather than speak pretty words though he can do that as well. I am glad we kinda took a break...]]>

  <description>Touch-sensitive FBI agent Lily Yu and her werewolf bond-mate are recruited by the Secret Service to help identify elected officials who have accepted demonic pacts. But Lily must turn to fellow agent Cynna Weaver for help when Cynna's former teacher, a demon master, emerges as the main suspect behind the pacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a demon commits a gruesome murder, sorcerer Cullen Seabourne joins the team racing the clock to find the apprentice of evil who uses demons to kill. Cynna and Cullen must work together- a challenge indeed when each has good reason to ignore the desire simmering between them. But passion and events both spiral out of control as an ancient prophecy is fulfilled- and the lupi's greatest enemy sets her sights on total devastation.</description>

  <description>**The Ghost and The Graveyard is a funny, exciting, and sexy read intended for adults. Due to sexual content, language, and violence this book is recommended for ages 18+** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grateful Knight isn't looking for love when she moves into a rent-free house on the edge of a graveyard. At twenty-two, all she wants is to recover financially so she can move back to the city where she belongs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sparks fly when the gorgeous cemetery caretaker, Rick, introduces himself and mentions his suspicion that her new house might be haunted. Her attraction to him seems supernatural, and despite her resolve to not get involved, she literally can't keep her hands off him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When things in Grateful's house start moving on their own, another man enters her life, Logan, a sexy ghost with a dark secret. He says Rick isn't what he seems, and indulging her passion for him could cost her soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing's for sure, magical forces are at work in the tiny town of Red Grove, and they're converging on Grateful. Life will never be the same once she's forced to choose between the ghost and the graveyard.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Friend or lover. Life or death...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supernatural cop Ari Calin arrives at the hostile Toronto vampire court with an ultimatum from the Riverdale vampires: Sebastian, Toronto's vampire prince, must stop his unprovoked attacks--or else. Ari wasn't expecting a fight--the "or else" was typical vampire grandstanding. But even with vampire Andreas De Luca by her side for a show of strength, things get ugly fast. Toronto's vampire world is in crisis, and surrounded by enemies, Ari and Andreas find themselves under attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Ari gets the call from the Magic Council ordering her home. Steffan, a good friend and leader of Riverdale's werewolves, has gone missing during top secret negotiations with the US government, and is believed to have been kidnapped--or killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andreas can't abandon the Toronto vampires, and Ari can't leave him to face impossible odds alone. But neither can she disobey her orders from the Council, or leave her friend Steffan to be tortured and killed. Ari's loyalties pull her in two directions--the closest thing to love she's ever known on one side, and friendship and duty on the other. If she can stay alive long enough for the choice to matter...</description>

  <description>A hidden evil stalks the city... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ari Calin refuses to believe her human friend Eddie murdered a vampire--in spite of his confession. Her human partner Ryan thinks the case is a slam dunk, even though there's no weapon and no witnesses, but Ari's not about to let her friend take the rap without finding out more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ari attends a charity event on the arm of a handsome werewolf, she finds someone she never expected to see again--Andreas De Luca, the charismatic vampire she used to date. When their eyes meet across the room, memories come rushing back. His kiss, his touch, a savage death...and a terrifying magical bond. A reconnection is the last thing she wants. Only by staying away and forgetting Andreas can she hope to avoid the Legend of Ramora. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when vampires keep dying, one thing becomes clear: Riverdale has a serial killer on its hands, and Andreas could be next. Ari begins to fear something truly evil is stalking the city, waiting to take control...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“She stood in the deep, dark woods, breath shallow and cold prickling over her skin despite the hot, heavy air. She took a step back, then two, as the urge to run fell over her.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naomi Bowes lost her innocence the night she followed her father into the woods. In freeing the girl trapped in the root cellar, Naomi revealed the horrible extent of her father’s crimes and made him infamous. No matter how close she gets to happiness, she can’t outrun the sins of Thomas David Bowes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now a successful photographer living under the name Naomi Carson, she has found a place that calls to her, a rambling old house in need of repair, thousands of miles away from everything she’s ever known. Naomi wants to embrace the solitude, but the kindly residents of Sunrise Cove keep forcing her to open up—especially the determined Xander Keaton. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Naomi can feel her defenses failing, and knows that the connection her new life offers is something she’s always secretly craved. But the sins of her father can become an obsession, and, as she’s learned time and again, her past is never more than a nightmare away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;That hot guy tied to Lissianna Argeneau's bed? He's not dessert - he's the main course!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lissianna has been spending her centuries pining for Mr. Right, not just a quick snack, and this sexy guy she finds in her bed looks like he might be a candidate. But there's another, more pressing issue: her tendency to faint at the sight of blood...an especially annoying quirk for a vampire. Of course it doesn't hurt that this man has a delicious-looking neck. What kind of cold-blooded vampire woman could resist a bite of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Hewitt recovers from the shock of waking up in a stranger's bedroom pretty quickly - once he sees a gorgeous woman about to treat him to a wild night of passion. But is it possible for the good doctor to find true love with a vampire vixen, or will he be just a good meal? That's a question Dr. Greg might be willing to sink his teeth into...if he can just get Lissianna to bite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this electrifying sixty-page companion novella to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Shatter Me series, discover the fate of the Omega Point rebels as they go up against The Reestablishment. Set during and soon after the final moments of &lt;em&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fracture Me&lt;/em&gt; is told from Adam's perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Omega Point prepares to launch an all-out assault on The Reestablishment soldiers stationed in Sector 45, Adam's focus couldn't be further from the upcoming battle. He's reeling from his breakup with Juliette, scared for his best friend's life, and as concerned as ever for his brother James's safety. And just as Adam begins to wonder if this life is really for him, the alarms sound. It's time for war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battlefield, it seems like the odds are in their favor—but taking down Warner, Adam's newly discovered half brother, won't be that easy. The Reestablishment can't tolerate a rebellion, and they'll do anything to crush the resistance . . . including killing everyone Adam has ever cared about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fracture Me&lt;/em&gt; sets the stage for &lt;em&gt;Ignite Me&lt;/em&gt;, the explosive finale in Tahereh Mafi's epic dystopian series. It's a novella not to be missed by fans who crave action-packed stories with tantalizing romance like &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt; by Veronica Roth, &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; by Suzanne Collins, and &lt;em&gt;Legend&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Lu.</description>

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heroes will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

Most of the Otherworlders prefer to haunt the Olde Town district--partying at vampire strip clubs, dining in elegant supper clubs, and inhabiting the cliffside caverns along the Mississippi. Being a cop is a tough job, but someone's gotta do it, and Ari's got her derringer, a sharp stiletto, and a few handy charms against things that hunt in the night. She's also a fire witch--a pedigree that comes in handy, since her partner's only human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a virtual reality drug hits the streets, people start to die, and an elusive pack of werewolves threatens the status quo. Ari and Ryan are drawn into a web of murder and evil that will lead sworn enemies to a confrontation. While the city simmers around them, Ari struggles to prevent an all-out supernatural war...</description>

  <description>When Dorina Basarab, half human, half vampire, assassin-for-hire, hits New Orleans, she thinks it's for a typical job: take out a mad master vamp before he can wreak havoc on the city. But when the elusive master suddenly shows up at her hotel, things get complicated, especially when Dory realizes that the murder he has in mind is his own! And that the Big Easy is about to get a whole lot harder.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The enemy is Other. The enemy is us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re down here, they’re up there, they’re nowhere. They want the Earth, they want us to have it. They came to wipe us out, they came to save us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beneath these riddles lies one truth: Cassie has been betrayed. So has Ringer. Zombie. Nugget. And all 7.5 billion people who used to live on our planet. Betrayed first by the Others, and now by ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these last days, Earth’s remaining survivors will need to decide what’s more important: saving themselves…or saving what makes us human.</description>

  <description>Are you a special snowflake? &lt;br /&gt;Do you enjoy networking to advance your career? &lt;br /&gt;Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh. Please go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is for the rest of us. These comics document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas, and wondering when, exactly, this adulthood thing begins. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life.</description>

  <description>It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jason has a problem&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t remember anything before waking up in a bus full of kids on a field trip. Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper, and a best friend named Leo. They’re all students at a boarding school for “bad kids.” What did Jason do to end up here? And where is here, exactly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Piper has a secret&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare about his being in trouble. Piper doesn’t understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesn’t recognize her. When a freak storm hits during the school trip, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling she’s going to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leo has a way with tools&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But there’s weird stuff, too—like the curse everyone keeps talking about, and some camper who's gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of them—including Leo—is related to a &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;. Does this have anything to do with Jason's amnesia, or the fact that Leo keeps seeing ghosts?</description>

  <description>With twelve hellhounds after her, pregnant Charley Davidson takes refuge at the only place she thinks they can’t get to her: the grounds of an abandoned convent. But after months of being cooped up there, Charley is ready to pop. Both metaphorically and literally since she is now roughly the size of a beached whale. Fortunately, a new case has captured her attention, one that involves a murder on the very grounds the team has taken shelter upon. A decades-old murder of the newly-vowed nun she keeps seeing in the shadows is almost enough to pull her out of her doldrums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley’s been forbidden to step foot off the sacred grounds. While the angry hellhounds can’t traverse the consecrated soil, they can lurk just beyond its borders. They have the entire team on edge, especially Reyes. And if Charley didn’t know better, she would swear Reyes is getting sick. He grows hotter with every moment that passes, his heat scorching across her skin every time he’s near, but naturally he swears he’s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the team searches for clues on the Twelve, Charley just wants answers and is powerless to get them. But the mass of friends they’ve accrued helps. They convince her even more that everyone in her recent life has somehow been drawn to her, as though they were a part of a bigger picture all along. But the good feelings don’t last for long because Charley is about to get the surprise of her crazy, mixed-up, supernatural life….</description>

But face to face with Jax Mercury…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Danger has never looked quite so delicious…</description>
