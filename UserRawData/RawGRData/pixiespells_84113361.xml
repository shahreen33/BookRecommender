  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first rule of this book club:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don't talk about book club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nashville Legends second baseman Gavin Scott's marriage is in major league trouble. He’s recently discovered a humiliating secret: his wife Thea has always faked the Big O. When he loses his cool at the revelation, it’s the final straw on their already strained relationship. Thea asks for a divorce, and Gavin realizes he’s let his pride and fear get the better of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Bromance Book Club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught and desperate, Gavin finds help from an unlikely source: a secret romance book club made up of Nashville's top alpha men. With the help of their current read, a steamy Regency titled &lt;i&gt;Courting the Countess&lt;/i&gt;, the guys coach Gavin on saving his marriage. But it'll take a lot more than flowery words and grand gestures for this hapless Romeo to find his inner hero and win back the trust of his wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When girl meets Duke, their marriage breaks all the rules…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his return from war, the Duke of Ashbury’s to-do list has been short and anything but sweet: brooding, glowering, menacing London ne’er-do-wells by night. Now there’s a new item on the list. He needs an heir—which means he needs a wife. When Emma Gladstone, a vicar’s daughter turned seamstress, appears in his library wearing a wedding gown, he decides on the spot that she’ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His terms are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will be husband and wife by night only.&lt;br /&gt;- No lights, no kissing. &lt;br /&gt;- No questions about his battle scars.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s pregnant with his heir, they need never share a bed again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emma is no pushover. She has a few rules of her own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will have dinner together every evening.&lt;br /&gt;- With conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- And unlimited teasing.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s seen the man beneath the scars, he can’t stop her from falling in love…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the original version of the book, If you purchased it in 2012, you probably read TRATR REDUX : &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13412712-the-rake-and-the-recluse" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francine Larrabee woke up on the wrong side of the century. She was fairly certain she went to sleep in her own comfy bed, but she doesn’t quite seem to be there now. Only adding to her problems is that she has no voice, is constantly being glowered at by a large, stunning man who is obsessed with propriety, and she is apparently betrothed to another horrid little man, determined to ruin her, and any other girls that get in his way.&lt;br /&gt;How does she find herself in the past, when she couldn’t even find herself in her present? How does a self sufficient businesswoman survive in a time when women were still considered property for the whole of their lives and what is she going to do with this man who draws her to him so fiercely.</description>

  <description>The competition is stiff. The stakes are high. And what happens on Halloween night is definitely not suitable for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Greene and Ben Addison didn’t realize the internship-to-hire opportunity was actually a contest, but neither of these talented web designers can afford to walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After betrayal destroyed her fabulous life in New York City, Celeste moved home to Nashville, Tennessee broke and broken. Restarting her career is her only goal. An ice queen who drove her partner to cheat can’t even think about friends or fun. Celeste’s talent and desperation should make the competition an easy win—if only she could stop gawking at her rival long enough to concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Addison doesn’t want to be a corporate climber or live in a high-rise downtown. He just needs a steady paycheck after foolishly investing everything in a pretty face and a shot at a music career. He has no business fantasizing about his competitor, even if she is the most stunning—and guarded—woman he’s ever met. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contest can’t rival the chemistry between these two, but is the risk worth the reward? With a haunting past and her future on the line, Celeste must decide what she wants, what she needs, and what her heart is really worth.</description>

  <description>A town gripped by fear. A woman accused of witchcraft. Who can save Pale Harbor from itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maine, 1846. Gabriel Stone is desperate to escape the ghosts that haunt him in Massachusetts after his wife’s death, so he moves to Maine, taking a position as a minister in the remote village of Pale Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all is as it seems in the sleepy town. Strange, unsettling things have been happening, and the townspeople claim that only one person can be responsible: Sophronia Carver, a reclusive widow who lives with a spinster maid in the eerie Castle Carver. Sophronia must be a witch, and she almost certainly killed her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the incidents escalate, one thing becomes clear: they are the work of a twisted person inspired by the wildly popular stories of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe. And Gabriel must find answers, or Pale Harbor will suffer a fate worthy of Poe’s darkest tales.</description>

  <description>The day her sister murdered their abusive father, Elizabeth Wilcox stopped being a gentleman’s daughter. Willing to do anything to save her sister from the hangman’s noose, now she is a spy... A servant. A liar. A thief. A submissive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masquerading as a parlor maid and entrenched in the Duke of Montague’s estate, Liz is willing to risk all to uncover the secrets that would save her sister. But submitting to the duke’s peculiar brand of discipline surprises her with a heady mixture of pleasure and pain. Eager to relinquish control of her messy life, Liz soon craves the rough hands of Montague and his powerful, passionate attentions. Can she succumb to the hot sting of his hand and the gentleness of his kisses without revealing her true identity and darkest secrets? And what punishment will she face when he realizes her betrayal?</description>

  <description>The ties that bind…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After surviving a living hell, Miss Amanda Wilcox craves a peaceful life. Time with her sister and quiet fireside nights are all she desires. That, and some lessons in pleasure. Too disgraced to ever marry, with no virtue left to protect, she has no qualms indulging in a liaison. And she’s found the perfect man to satisfy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julius Blackwell, Earl of Rothchild was tasked with one job – look after his absent best friend’s new sister-in-law. Bedding his charge is out of the question. Too timid to even leave her home, he can’t imagine she’d submit to his more adventuresome tastes. She’s a distraction he can’t afford, especially as the Crown has asked him to uncover a dangerous blackmail ring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Amanda catches the blackmailers’ attention, Julius will do anything to ensure her safety, even if that means tying her to his bed. With loyalties tested and lives on the line, Julius will need Amanda’s help to outwit the cutthroats. They’ll have to learn to trust each other, in and out of the bedroom, or they’ll find themselves and their loved ones at the end of their ropes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There’s bad, and inappropriate, and scandalous, and &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s giving your virginity to your gorgeous and dominant high school government Professor, on his desk, five minutes after you turn eighteen.&lt;br /&gt;Oh I’ve been a bad, bad girl…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winchester Academy is home to a lot of things – the spoiled rich kids of the world’s elite, ivy-covered walls, typical high school drama and angst, and &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;– Professor Oliver Bard. Dominant, alpha, and &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; freaking gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know he looks at me, even if he sees me as forbidden fruit—tempting, off-limits &lt;i&gt;jailbait&lt;/i&gt;. But I’ve been obsessed with him for way, way too long, which is why I purposefully got myself thrown into his infamous “midnight detention” on the eve of my eighteenth birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the two of us, alone, watching the clock tick down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, this would be illegal. Today, it’s just plain wrong. Wrong, sick, morally reprehensible, and &lt;i&gt;achingly&lt;/i&gt; hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could ruin him, and put a scarlet letter on my back for the rest of high school. But once I feel those big hands on me, and once I get a taste of his perfect, forbidden mouth, and once he shows me things I’ve only ever dreamed about, imagining him, I know there’s no going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I should say no, but that’s a little hard to do when his mouth and hands and…well, other things are only making me scream &lt;i&gt;“yes, professor”&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each of the Winchester Academy books are completely standalone stories, with no cliffhangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot, wild, and insta-love galore, with an utterly obsessed alpha hero and an untouched, very, very off-limits heroine. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty stories, this one’s for you! As with all my books, this steamy novella is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>All's &lt;i&gt;faire&lt;/i&gt; in love and war for two sworn enemies who indulge in a harmless flirtation in a laugh-out-loud rom-com from debut author, Jen DeLuca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily knew there would be strings attached when she relocated to the small town of Willow Creek, Maryland, for the summer to help her sister recover from an accident, but who could anticipate getting roped into volunteering for the local Renaissance Faire alongside her teenaged niece? Or that the irritating and inscrutable schoolteacher in charge of the volunteers would be so annoying that she finds it impossible to stop thinking about him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faire is Simon's family legacy and from the start he makes clear he doesn't have time for Emily's lighthearted approach to life, her oddball Shakespeare conspiracy theories, or her endless suggestions for new acts to shake things up. Yet on the faire grounds he becomes a different person, flirting freely with Emily when she's in her revealing wench's costume. But is this attraction real, or just part of the characters they're portraying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer was only ever supposed to be a pit stop on the way to somewhere else for Emily, but soon she can't seem to shake the fantasy of establishing something more with Simon, or a permanent home of her own in Willow Creek.</description>

  <description>Two rough twin mountain men. One princess on the run. She thinks she can’t have babies. But *baby* are we gonna prove her wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our enemies conspired to murder our father, take our company, and set us up for the crimes, running to the woods of Blackthorn Mountain was the only option we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought we’d left everything good and beautiful in the world behind. That is, until she tumbles into our arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous, whip-smart, and a mouth as fiery as that red hair. Catching her skinny-dipping in our lake lights the spark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…Laying our hands on her sets the whole thing on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in the woods has turned us into the hardened rough mountain men we are today. She should stay away – from us, and from the dark past that looms over our shoulders. But one taste of her sweet lips, and one of her breathless moans in our ears, and we both know we’re never going to let her out of her hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We share everything, and we’ve always sworn that nothing will get between us. But then, Stella between us might just be exactly what saves us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shadow of our past still hunting us down, and the demons from hers still looming, this whole thing could blow up in our face. But we’ll be damned if that keeps her away from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks she can’t have a family. We’ve always wanted one. The odds are against us, but then, three is a crowd…  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild, out of control, over the top, and completely ridiculous. If you love your growly alpha cavemen heroes in twos, you're going to see double with these twins. Safe, no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bold, seductive laird meets his passionate match in a scintillating Highland romance from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sword fighting, swearing, and riding astride come naturally to Saidh Buchanan. Simpering and holding her tongue—definitely not. Raised alongside seven boisterous brothers, Saidh has little interest in saddling herself with a husband... until she glimpses the new Laird MacDonnell bathing naked in the loch. Though she's far from a proper lady, the brawny Highlander makes Saidh feel every inch a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has an angel's looks, a warrior's temper, and seeks out his kisses with wanton eagerness. Little wonder that Greer is intrigued by his comely guest. When reckless desire overtakes them, he's more than willing to make an honest woman of her. But Saidh is the target of a hidden enemy, and Greer faces the battle of his life to safeguard the woman he wants above all others.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ISBN 038077013X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought her heart was safe, but ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reckless, wild, and beautiful, Lily Lawson delights in shocking proper London society—and now she is determined to rescue her sister from an unwanted impending marriage to the notorious Alex, Lord Raiford, by fair means or foul. But while she succeeds outrageously, Alex is a master gamesman who is not to be undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex has lost one bride, yet he is enchanted by this remarkable lady who is willing to break any rule to flaunt her independence. When Lily offers him only scorn, he counters with kindness, and he parries her blistering barbs with gentle words and a soft, tender touch. The spirited miss will pay dearly for her interference—with her body, her soul, and her stubborn, unyielding heart. But will Alex's own heart be the prize to be won in this sensuous game of love?</description>

  <description>Up on my mountain, she’ll play by my rules. My obsession. My Temptation. My Captive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I left life as a hitman for the Russian mob years ago, I never wanted to look back. I took the millions I’d made doing their dirty work and built my retreat up on Blackthorn Mountain, away from everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a flash wildfire brings her to my front door, and from the moment I lay eyes on her, I know one thing: she’ll be mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous, sassy, innocent, untouched...and my prisoner. No one can know I’m here, so she stays. I’m keeping her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as a contract killer and now as a rough mountain man has turned my heart cold. I should keep a sweet girl like her away from me. But once I put my hands on her tempting curves and once I taste those sweet, innocent lips, I want nothing else than to keep her as close as possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve saved her from the fire, but if we aren’t careful, we’ll both get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my past isn’t done with me. The mob I walked away from years before thinks they can use Chloe to get to me, but they’re dead fucking wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because up here, I’m king, she’s my mountain queen, and I’ll storm heaven and hell to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe’s got a fight in her, but once I lay my hands on her, I’m never letting her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so we’re clear, this book is completely out of control, and reality has left the building. If you’re looking for realism, this ain’t it. BUT, if you’ve got a hankering for a growly-alpha-caveman hero that will stop at nothing to claim what’s his, then you’re probably going to devour this book ;). Safe, no cheating, and HEA guaranteed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They’re rebels, scoundrels, and blackguards—dark, dashing men on the wrong side of the law. But for the women who love them, a hint of danger only makes the heart beat faster…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;STEALING BEAUTY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorian Blackwell, the Blackheart of Ben More, is a ruthless villain. Scarred and hard-hearted, Dorian is one of London’s wealthiest, most influential men who will stop at nothing to wreak vengeance on those who’ve wronged him…and will fight to the death to seize what he wants. The lovely, still innocent widow Farah Leigh Mackenzie is no exception—and soon Dorian whisks the beautiful lass away to his sanctuary in the wild Highlands…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COURTING DESIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Farah is no one’s puppet. She possesses a powerful secret—one that threatens her very life. When being held captive by Dorian proves to be the only way to keep Farah safe from those who would see her dead, Dorian makes Farah a scandalous proposition: marry him for protection in exchange for using her secret to help him exact revenge on his enemies. But what the Blackheart of Ben More never could have imagined is that Farah has terms of her own, igniting a tempestuous desire that consumes them both. Could it be that the woman he captured is the only one who can touch the black heart he’d long thought dead?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>My mountain. My cabin. My woman – she just doesn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I left civilization and my demons a long time ago, seeking solitude up on Blackthorn mountain. Just one ex-marine, a remote cabin, and the wilderness, with no distractions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then she turns up, blowing in with a winter’s blizzard like a very fucking big distraction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blonde, beautiful, and mouthy as all hell, even when I save her from freezing that sweet little ass off.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rough mountain man like me should want nothing to do with a rich little city girl like Katrina. Except one look at her sweet, tempting curves, and one taste of those sassy, pouty lips, and I want everything to do with her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I saved her from freezing, but maybe it’s her who’s going to save my frozen heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re trapped up here for the storm, locked in a cabin with only the heat between us to keep us warm. Her wealthy, city family thinks they can marry her off to some rich little shit. But they’re very wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My mountain. My cabin. My woman.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll make Katrina my bride, and I’ll be damned if I let them take her from me.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Eric Rickstad delivers the electrifying sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Silent Girls,&lt;/em&gt; and features once again detectives Frank Rath and Sonja Test as they track a depraved killer through rural Vermont.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every murder tells a story. Some stories never end . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a remote northern Vermont town, college student Rachel Rath is being watched. She can feel the stranger’s eyes on her, relentless and possessive. And she’s sure the man watching her is the same man who killed her mother and father years ago: Ned Preacher, a serial rapist and murderer who gamed the system to get a light sentence. Now, he’s free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Frank Rath adopted Rachel, his niece, after the shocking murder of her parents when she was a baby. Ever since, Rath’s tried to protect her from the true story of her parents’ deaths. But now Preacher is calling Rath to torment him. He’s threatening Rachel and plotting cruelties for her, of the flesh and of the mind&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;When other girls are found brutally murdered, and a woman goes missing, Rath and Detective Sonja Test must untangle the threads that tie these new crimes and some long-ago nightmares together. Soon they will learn that the truth is more perverse than anyone could guess, rife with secrets, cruel desires, and warped, deadly loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mesmerizing, startling, and intricately plotted, &lt;em&gt;The Names of Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt; builds relentlessly on its spellbinding premise, luring readers into its dark and macabre mystery, right to its shocking end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Sam Brandis was Tate Jones’s first: Her first love. Her first everything. Including her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During a whirlwind two-week vacation abroad, Sam and Tate fell for each other in only the way that first loves do: sharing all of their hopes, dreams, and deepest secrets along the way. Sam was the first, and only, person that Tate—the long-lost daughter of one of the world’s biggest film stars—ever revealed her identity to. So when it became clear her trust was misplaced, her world shattered for good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years later, Tate, now an up-and-coming actress, only thinks about her first love every once in a blue moon. When she steps onto the set of her first big break, he’s the last person she expects to see. Yet here Sam is, the same charming, confident man she knew, but even more alluring than she remembered. Forced to confront the man who betrayed her, Tate must ask herself if it’s possible to do the wrong thing for the right reason… and whether “once in a lifetime” &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; come around twice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Christina Lauren’s signature “beautifully written and remarkably compelling” (Sarah J. Maas, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author) prose and perfect for fans of Emily Giffin and Jennifer Weiner, &lt;i&gt;Twice in a Blue Moon &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable and moving novel of young love and second chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Unhoneymooners &lt;/i&gt;and the “delectable, moving” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;My Favorite Half-Night Stand &lt;/i&gt;comes a modern love story about what happens when your first love reenters your life when you least expect it…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“Marissa Stapley’s writing is a gift.”—Pam Jenoff, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of&lt;i&gt; The Orphan’s Tale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harmony Resort promises hope for struggling marriages. Run by celebrity power couple Drs. Miles and Grace Markell, the "last resort" offers a chance for partners to repair their relationships in a luxurious setting on the gorgeous Mayan Riviera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johanna and Ben have a marriage that looks perfect on the surface, but in reality, they don’t know each other at all. Shell and Colin fight constantly: after all, Colin is a workaholic, and Shell always comes second to his job as an executive at a powerful mining company. But what has really torn them apart is too devastating to talk about. When both couples begin Harmony's intensive therapy program, it becomes clear that Harmony is not all it seems—and neither are Miles and Grace themselves. What are they hiding, and what price will these couples pay for finding out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a deadly tropical storm descends on the coast, trapping the hosts and the guests on the resort, secrets are revealed, loyalties are tested and not one single person—or their marriage—will remain unchanged by what follows.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marissa Stapley is a journalist and the author of the acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;Things to Do When It's Raining&lt;/i&gt;. She writes page-turning, deeply emotional fiction about families, friends and women's lives. Visit her at marissastapley.com or follow her on Twitter, @marissastapley.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands returns to the Highlands of Scotland in her hottest new historical romance yet!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlander Campbell Sinclair is no stranger to battle, so when he sees a lad attacked by bandits, he jumps into the fray. He didn't count on being stabbed. Grateful to the boy for nursing him back to health, Cam offers to accompany Jo safely to his destination. But when he accidentally comes across the lad bathing in the river, Cam discovers that Jo is actually Joan...with the most sinful of curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan promised her mother that she would deliver a scroll to the clan MacKay. But traveling alone is dangerous, even disguised as a boy. When a Scottish warrior lends his aid, she is more than relieved...until he surprises her with lingering kisses and caresses that prove her disguise hasn't fooled him. As their passion ignites, will the secrets of the scroll force a wedding...and lead to a love she's never known?</description>

  <description>Two older men who want to share,&lt;br /&gt;To punish, and train, and make me theirs.&lt;br /&gt;Four firm hands to spank and tease,&lt;br /&gt;Two big daddies are what some brats need…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s off limits in too many ways to count.&lt;br /&gt;Too young. Too untouched. Too much my deadbeat sister’s step-kid.&lt;br /&gt;Five-foot nine and one-hundred and eleven pounds of pure. Fucking. Temptation.&lt;br /&gt;She’s got no business living in this big old house with me and my best friend – two rough, hardened ex-marines more than twice her age. But she’s here, under my roof and under my rules.&lt;br /&gt;…and she’s breaking every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Staying out late, flirting with boys, acting out, and being a royal brat every chance she gets. She’s been pushing her luck and getting away with murder the last month but that all stops now.&lt;br /&gt;Because in this house, we have rules, and it’s time Kenzie Gates learned what happens to bad girl who break the rules.&lt;br /&gt;This brat might need more than just a firm hand of discipline.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing there’s two of us… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buckle up and hold on tight, because we’re about to get filthy. This is quite possibly one of if not the dirtiest little book I’ve ever written. In fact, it’s the kind of book where you’d be mortified if your friends found out you were reading it. Trust me, I’m not gonna judge, but I thought you should be warned ;).&lt;br /&gt;Alpha as fuck, completely over-the-top, and sweet enough to make you melt. This mfm romance is all about her - no m/m. Safe, no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.</description>

  <description>Ambitious graduate Marin Collins accepts a four-month internship at a prestigious public relations firm to work on a tech account, but her plans are derailed when she’s assigned to go on the road with touring rock band Kings Quarters, hailed by Rolling Stone as the next big thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Brad Osterhauser, the reluctant rock star who would rather be coding computer games than penning Grammy-nominated songs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling by bus, city to city with a group of practical joking bandmates and a greedy manager, Marin and Brad forge a friendship and forbidden romance over a shared love of Seinfeld episodes, stolen moments and Red Vines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Marin’s accused of betraying her company and the band, will Brad come to her defense or believe she was disloyal to him for the sake of her career? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating perspectives of Marin and Brad, Starfish is a contemporary romance of unexpected love, the redemptive power of music and hogging the bed.</description>

  <description>Gladiator meets Game of Thrones: a royal woman becomes a skilled warrior to destroy her murderous cousin, avenge her family, and save her kingdom in this first entry in a dazzling fantasy epic from the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of the Elemental Assassin series—an enthralling tale that combines magic, murder, intrigue, adventure, and a hint of romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a realm where one’s magical power determines one’s worth, Lady Everleigh’s lack of obvious ability relegates her to the shadows of the royal court of Bellona, a kingdom steeped in gladiator tradition. Seventeenth in line for the throne, Evie is nothing more than a ceremonial fixture, overlooked and mostly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces are at work inside the palace. When her cousin Vasilia, the crown princess, assassinates her mother the queen and takes the throne by force, Evie is also attacked, along with the rest of the royal family. Luckily for Evie, her secret immunity to magic helps her escape the massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced into hiding to survive, she falls in with a gladiator troupe. Though they use their talents to entertain and amuse the masses, the gladiators are actually highly trained warriors skilled in the art of war, especially Lucas Sullivan, a powerful magier with secrets of his own. Uncertain of her future—or if she even has one—Evie begins training with the troupe until she can decide her next move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the bloodthirsty Vasilia exerts her power, pushing Bellona to the brink of war, Evie’s fate becomes clear: she must become a fearsome gladiator herself . . . and kill the queen.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanting her could destroy us.&lt;br /&gt;Touching her could start a war.&lt;br /&gt;But the consequences stopped mattering the moment we knew she’d be &lt;i&gt;ours&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Now sharing her is our &lt;i&gt;obsession&lt;/i&gt;, and we &lt;i&gt;won’t&lt;/i&gt; be stopped…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call us &lt;i&gt;Kings&lt;/i&gt;. Born on the war-torn streets of Belfast and trained in the hard-knocks life of crime, now we’re two ruthless Kingpins at the very top of the Irish mob. And we’re visiting Boston for one reason: to kill the man who hurt one of our own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But “the plan” goes out the window the second &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; walks into the room. Gorgeous, alluring, and feisty as hell. Sharp green eyes, blazing red hair, and legs a man can only dream of feeling wrapped around his waist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Phoebe’s also entirely off-limits. She’s forbidden fruit, and dangerous as fuck. Hell, she belongs to the man we’re here to kill. But then, she stopped being another man’s woman the second he put her up as a bet in a card game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…And when the chips fall, you better believe we’re going to collect our prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing ourselves with her could make us lose everything. But one taste of her makes us lose all control, and we know we won’t be stopped from taking what’s &lt;i&gt;ours&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because now, we’ve got a new plan: claim her as our own, keep her safe, and &lt;i&gt;destroy&lt;/i&gt; anyone who tries to take her from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re not sure if Phoebe’s got any Irish in her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…but she’s &lt;i&gt;about to&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ready for completely over-the-top, extremely unrealistic, insta-love fantasy at its finest? We’re talking page two forever-love, so buckle up, hang on tight, and don’t say I didn’t warn you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab a pint, raise a toast, and get ready for twice the growly alpha goodness. Sláinte!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mfm romance is all about her – no m/m. As with all my books, this standalone novella is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>"YOU'RE THE CARETAKER, SIR. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE CARETAKER. I SHOULD KNOW, SIR. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE...."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- DELBERT GRADY OF THE OVERLOOK HOTEL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHINING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published in 1977, &lt;i&gt;The Shining&lt;/i&gt; quickly became a benchmark in the literary career of Stephen King. This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel's past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to laim the very souls of the Torrence family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adapted into a cinematic masterpiece of horror by legendary Stanley Kubrick -- featuring an unforgettable performance by a demonic Jack Nicholson --&lt;i&gt;The Shining&lt;/i&gt; stands as a cultural icon of modern horror, a searing study of a family torn apart, and a nightmarish glimpse into the dark recesses of human weakness and dementia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen—especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friend Zone&lt;/i&gt; will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I haven't touched a human in three years. That seems like it would be a difficult task, but it's not. Not anymore, thanks to the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, quite possibly, the most popular recluse ever. Not many shut-ins have a 200-member fan club, a bank account in the seven-figure range, and hundreds of men lining up to pay for undivided attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get satisfaction, I get a distraction. Their secret desires are nothing compared to why I hide... my lust for blood, my love of death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking their money is easy. Keeping all these secrets... one is bound to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if you hid yourself away because all you could think of was killing? And what if one girl's life was depending on you venturing into society?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter a world of lies, thrills, fears, and all desires, in this original thriller from A. R. Torre.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She stood at danger's threshold—then love beckoned her in.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shelter of her country cottage, Sara Fielding puts pen to paper to create dreams. But curiosity has enticed the prim, well-bred gentlewoman out of her safe haven—and into Derek Craven's dangerous world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A handsome, tough and tenacious Cockney, he rose from poverty to become lord of London's most exclusive gambling house—a struggle that has left Derek Craven fabulously wealthy, but hardened and suspicious. And now duty demands he allow Sara Fielding into his world—with her impeccable manners and her infuriating innocence. But here, in a perilous shadow-realm of ever-shifting fortunes, even a proper "mouse" can be transformed into a breathtaking enchantress—and a world-weary gambler can be shaken to his cynical core by the power of passion...and the promise of love.</description>

  <description>Meg Sanders has spent her life playing by the rules—until tonight. It’s her birthday and she’s determined to be a little wild and a whole lot carefree, at least until she has to get back to reality tomorrow. But the last thing she expects is to be seduced on the dance floor by two gorgeous men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo and Galen are each incredibly sexy on their own, and potentially devastating as a pair—and they want her. Meg isn’t down for anything resembling complicated when her life is such a mess, but the two of them win her over with the promise of a night out of her deepest, darkest fantasy—and that they walk the next morning with no strings attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, anything goes when it’s only for one night…</description>

  <description>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first in a new historical series set in the Highlands of Scotland, from Lynsay Sands, the New York Times bestselling author of the Argeneau vampire series and countless historical romances.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabel was about to take the veil to become a nun when her mother suddenly arrives at the Abbey to take her home… so that she can marry the Scottish laird who is betrothed to her runaway sister! She knows nothing about being a wife, nothing about how to run a household, and definitely nothing about the marriage bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But from the moment Ross MacKay sets eyes on Annabel, he is taken with his shy sweet bride… and the fact that she's blessed with lush curves only makes him utter his own prayers of thanks. But when an enemy endangers her life, he'll move the Highlands themselves to save her. For though Annabel's not the bride he planned for, she's the only woman he desires…</description>

You could say I took a big risk because I have acquired all SEVEN of the published books of Highland Brides not having read a single one! 🙈 <br /><br />But I was pretty confident that I would at least find SOME enjoyment in these historical romances...]]>

  <description>A cursed girl escapes death and finds herself in a magical world - but is then tested beyond her wildest imagination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morrigan Crow is cursed. Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she's blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks--and, worst of all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Morrigan awaits her fate, a strange and remarkable man named Jupiter North appears. Chased by black-smoke hounds and shadowy hunters on horseback, he whisks her away into the safety of a secret, magical city called Nevermoor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's then that Morrigan discovers Jupiter has chosen her to contend for a place in the city's most prestigious organization: the Wundrous Society. In order to join, she must compete in four difficult and dangerous trials against hundreds of other children, each boasting an extraordinary talent that sets them apart - an extraordinary talent that Morrigan insists she does not have. To stay in the safety of Nevermoor for good, Morrigan will need to find a way to pass the tests - or she'll have to leave the city to confront her deadly fate.</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Liz Carlyle creates her darkest, most sensuous story yet, as a delectable but desperate governess runs headlong into the path of a notorious rake...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women rarely refuse the wicked Earl of Hepplewood, whose daring exploits are only whispered about. But when his new governess answers his proposition with a slap, then stalks out, references in hand, Hepplewood finds more than his face is burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabella Aldridge has brains, bravado, and beauty—but the latter is no use to a servant. Her circumstances are desperate, and with Hepplewood's words ringing in her ears, Isabella realizes she must barter her most marketable asset . . . her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when fate sends Isabella back into Hepplewood's arms, the earl must make an impossible choice—draw Isabella down into his sensual darkness, or behave with honor for the first time in his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if you had a second chance at first love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;She feels lost in social situations, saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way. She just can't read people. She prefers the quiet solitude of books or playing chess to being around others. Apart from Jonathan. She liked being around him, but she hasn't seen him for ten years. Until now that is. And she's not sure he'll want to see her again after what happened all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;Except that, actually, she doesn't like being alone at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl He Used to Know&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting novel full of surprising revelations that keep you turning the page. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes, Gail Honeyman, Jill Santopolo and &lt;i&gt;Sliding Doors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From the glittering ballrooms of Regency London to the glorious gardens of countryside manors, Lisa Kleypas invites her readers to visit a lushly romantic world. Now, Lisa has written her most unforgettable love story...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Lady Hawksworth, your husband is not dead..."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With those words, Lara's life turned upside down. Hunter, Earl of Hawksworth, had been lost at sea. Or so she'd been told. Their unhappy marriage—with its cold caresses and passionless kisses—was over. But now a powerful, virile man stood before her, telling secrets only a husband could know, and vowing she would once again be his wife in &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; way. While Lara couldn't deny that this man with the smoldering dark eyes resembled Hunter, he was attentive and loving in ways he never was before. Soon she desperately wanted to believe, with every beat of her heart, that this stranger was truly her husband. But had this rake reformed—or was Lara being seduced by a cunning stranger?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31375813" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times best-selling author of Beautiful Bastard, Beautiful Stranger, and Beautiful Player, Book Two of the brand-new Wild Seasons series that started with Sweet Filthy Boy - a story of friends, love, and lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their rowdy hookups, Harlow and Finn don't even like each other... which would explain why their marriage lasted only 12 hours. He needs to be in charge and takes whatever he wants. She lives by the Want-something-done? Do-it-yourself mantra. Maybe she's too similar to the rugged fisherman - or just what he needs.</description>

  <description>Katya – young, beautiful and impoverished – arrives in Paris, hoping to begin a new life. She leaves behind a terrible secret, and her survival in this strange and beautiful new city depends on nobody ever discovering who – and what – she is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, Katya is swept up in the city’s glamour – particularly the boutiques on the main boulevard, where glittering gowns are hand-sewn for an exclusive clientele. Dare Katya dream that she may someday wear – or even design – one of these dazzling creations? It feels like an impossible wish, until she meets businessman Harry Morten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tall, handsome and well-connected, Harry could give Katya everything she wants and more… but at what price? And should she break the vow she’s made and trust him with her secret when her very survival could be at stake?</description>

  <description>Skilled, sculpted, and sexy, the men of adult entertainment are the kind of guys a woman reserves for her fantasies, not her reality. But is there more to these professional hotties than meets the eye?…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Robyn Flores meets Zac Fallon is one of those days. You know, when you’re already late for work. Mostly because you haven’t really slept since your best friend abandoned you for her fiancé and her exponentially better life. The kind of day you drag yourself to the cleaners to pick up your laundry, only to discover you’ve got the wrong bag—Star Spangled sequined thong, anyone? So Robyn is definitely not ready for the ridiculously gorgeous guy at her front door, except that they have each other’s clothes. But then, is any woman ever ready to meet the love of her life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem: Zac Fallon is not the love of Robyn’s life. Zac knows, despite the all-too-intimate dinner they share, he doesn’t have a shot at her. Because the next time Zac sees Robyn, he’s front and center of the male revue headlining her best friend’s bachelorette party. So much for wooing the pretty schoolteacher, much less impressing her old-fashioned family, with his upstanding lifestyle. Now he’s only got one way to win his dream girl. It’s gonna be the steamiest, most irresistible seduction she’s ever seen. And this time it will be no act…</description>

  <description>In this witty, sexy tale, an erotic novelist meets the fictional hero of her most recent book in real life, and must decide whether she wants to get him back between the pages—or between her sheets.At forty-six, Sadie Fuller’s life isn’t exactly romantic. A divorced, overweight, somewhat sexually frustrated mother of an eleven-year-old, she lives in the suburbs, shops the big box stores, makes small talk with her small-minded neighbors, and generally leads a quiet life. But while her daughter is at school, or when Sadie is up late at night, she writes erotic fiction under the name KT Briggs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, during a routine shopping trip, Sadie runs into someone familiar…too familiar, in fact. She encounters an incredibly handsome man &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; like the one in her imagination—&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; her latest novel. Is Aidan Hathaway really one of her characters? And if so, what is he doing in Target? As Sadie tries to negotiate this strange new world, her eyes begin to open to romantic possibilities in places she never dreamed of looking…places where Happily Ever After might not be so far-fetched after all.</description>

  <description>Sabrina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s the cockiest bastard I’ve ever met and I mean that with all the affection and adoration in the world. I’ve been in love with him for years, and not just because of those intense blue eyes or that slow smug smile that promises to make all your dreams come true. I’ve seen what lies under that smile and his cocksure attitude. It’s enough to make me melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I’d ever let him know. Not only is Luke Cochran one of Hollywood’s up-and-coming movie stars…he’s also my boss. I’m his personal assistant and have seen all the women who come and go in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t even hold a candle. But a girl can dream…right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina is one of the sharpest, funniest, kindest people I’ve ever met. Sometimes, I think I’m taking advantage of her, but I seriously cannot cope with my hectic lifestyle without her to keep me on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my life just got totally knocked off track. One of my sisters called. They need me back home. My mother is sick and the last thing I can think about is the promotional tour I’ve got coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina’s coming with me. She’s the only person who can keep me focused and centered in a time like this. Besides, my family adores her. And it’s just a quick visit. My mother is tough. She’ll be alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then something happens that knocks me for a loop and when my mother tells me that all she really wants in life is to see her kids happy and settled down, I do the stupidest damn thing ever and announce that Sabrina and I are in love. Now I’ve just got to convince my best friend to play along with me and act like she’s my fiancée and we’re stupid in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No big deal…right?</description>

  <description>The infamous pirate Black Jack Rhys never encountered a ship he could not board or a woman he could not bed. But the dashing brigand may have met his match in the fiery beauty who has vowed to bring him to justice . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fearless, flame-haired enchantress, Lorelei Dupree believes she has a duty to her fiancé and to the city of Charleston to help end the reign of the notorious Black Jack. But when the bold pirate eludes her carefully set trap, she suddenly finds herself the prisoner of the irresistible criminal they call "Master of Seduction." Once trapped in Jack's intoxicating gaze, Lorelei feels herself falling under the handsome rogue's sensuous spell. And now the terror of the high seas faces the one peril he never anticipated—for though he has stolen so many hearts, he never dreamed he'd meet a woman who could so effortlessly conquer his own.</description>

  <description>Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions—like grief. And love. He thinks he’s defective. His family knows better—that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can’t turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn’t go as planned. Esme’s lessons in love seem to be working…but only on herself. She’s hopelessly smitten with a man who’s convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Esme’s time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he’s been wrong all along. And there’s more than one way to love.</description>

  <description>When Bennett’s friends steal him away from Chloe for a weekend of shenanigans and strippers in Vegas, their first stop doesn’t exactly go as planned. Their scheme for a guys’ weekend completely derailed, Bennett and Max take every chance they get to rendezvous secretly with the women they love. But when the persistently single Will Sumner catches on, the pair realizes they need to team up with him instead of butting heads if they’re to escape for more sexy Vegas hookups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Bastard’s Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan are back for one last blazing prewedding hurrah- but if what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, they might not ever want to leave!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An archaeologist with a zest for life finds herself stranded in small-town North Carolina—with a brooding Highland hunk who's straight out of ancient Scotland.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramsay MacDara wishes the goddesses had left his arse back in the tenth century. That way he never would have met the gold digger who made a fool out of him. A loner at heart, Ramsay is riding his beloved horse through the woods near his family's North Carolina theme park, Highland Life and Legends, when he hears tires squealing—followed by a thud—and rushes to the scene to help. That's when he sets his eyes on a pair of long legs sticking out of the moon roof of a car. His interest piqued, the rest of her will soon arouse his greatest desires...and deepest fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archaeologist Katie Jenson is on a six-month sabbatical from her job at Princeton University. Following the death of her beloved father—whose dying request was for Katie to live life to the fullest—she's headed to a friend's beach house in North Carolina. But a momentary distraction takes her off the road and on the journey of her life...with a sex god in a kilt at her side. Ramsay's passion is the stuff of legend—and it just may be Katie's greatest discovery.</description>

  <description>During rehearsals for "The Taming of the Shrew," sparks fly between the fiercely independent leading lady Caitlyn and leading man DB, who is notorious for bedding his costars. As the two stars spar and spark, the cast and crew are by turns amused, disgusted, jealous, bored, and -- in one case, at least -- crazy.</description>

      <![CDATA[As a theatre brat I thought this romance would have been right up my alley. I have to be honest, I was gravely disappointed. With the writing errors, the bizarre plot twists, unlikable characters and the heavily religious undertones, Kiss Me Caitlyn was a hot mess! <br /><br />The tone of the book seems very...]]>

  <description>"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now—reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers—not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained—and captivated—by their stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would he say . . . ?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>Escaping a cheating ex, finance whiz Sara Dillon’s moved to New York City and is looking for excitement and passion without a lot of strings attached. So meeting the irresistible, sexy Brit at a dance club should have meant nothing more than a night’s fun. But the manner—and speed—with which he melts her inhibitions turns him from a one-time hookup and into her Beautiful Stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole city knows that Max Stella loves women, not that he’s ever found one he particularly wants to keep around. Despite pulling in plenty with his Wall Street bad boy charm, it’s not until Sara—and the wild photos she lets him take of her—that he starts wondering if there’s someone for him outside of the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooking up in places where anybody could catch them, the only thing scarier for Sara than getting caught in public is having Max get too close in private.</description>

  <description>Just when Chloe’s career starts to take off, Bennett wishes it would all slow down long enough to spend a wild night alone with his intern-cum-girlfriend. Preferably one in which he can show her he’s still the boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her continued refusals to take time off with him, Bennett can finally no longer take no for an answer. And so the couple find themselves with two plane tickets, one French villa, and a surprising conversation that, predictably, leaves them wrestling under the covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking up where Beautiful Bastard left off, Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan continue their fiery love-hate relationship . . . and take it to the next level.</description>

  <description>Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a &lt;i&gt;complete git&lt;/i&gt;, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here — it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Carry On - The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two centuries after the Salem witch trials, there’s still one witch left in Massachusetts. But she doesn’t even know it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take this as a warning: if you are not able or willing to control yourself, it will not only be you who suffers the consequences but those around you, as well.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Oldbury, 1821 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of a scandal, the Montrose family and their three daughters—Catherine, Lydia, and Emeline—flee Boston for their new country home, Willow Hall. The estate seems sleepy and idyllic. But a subtle menace creeps into the atmosphere, remnants of a dark history that call to Lydia, and to the youngest, Emeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three daughters will be irrevocably changed by what follows, but none more than Lydia, who must draw on a power she never knew she possessed if she wants to protect those she loves.

  <description>Award-winning author Alyssa Cole’s Reluctant Royals series continues with a woman on a quest to be the heroine of her own story and the duke in shining armor she rescues along the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City socialite and perpetual hot mess Portia Hobbs is tired of disappointing her family, friends, and—most importantly—herself. An apprenticeship with a struggling swordmaker in Scotland is a chance to use her expertise and discover what she’s capable of. Turns out she excels at aggravating her gruff silver fox boss…when she’s not having inappropriate fantasies about his sexy Scottish burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tavish McKenzie doesn’t need a rich, spoiled American telling him how to run his armory…even if she is infuriatingly good at it. Tav tries to rebuff his apprentice, and his attraction to her, but when Portia accidentally discovers that he’s the secret son of a duke, rough-around-the-edges Tav becomes her newest makeover project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forging metal into weapons and armor is one thing, but when desire burns out of control and the media spotlight gets too hot to bear, can a commoner turned duke and his posh apprentice find lasting love?</description>

  <description>Listening length: 10 hours, 12 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-night stands are supposed to be with someone convenient, or wickedly persuasive, or regrettable. They aren’t supposed to be with someone like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a crazy Vegas weekend celebrating her college graduation—and terrified of the future path she knows is a cop-out—Mia Holland makes the wildest decision of her life: follow Ansel Guillaume—her sweet, filthy fling—to France for the summer and just…play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When feelings begin to develop behind the provocative roles they take on, and their temporary masquerade adventures begin to feel real, Mia will have to decide if she belongs in the life she left because it was all wrong, or in the strange new one that seems worlds away.</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

      <![CDATA[So this review is a little over due but I had to think on this book a while. This was a tough one. I certainly was well warned on how Colleen Hoover tears at your heartstrings in this frustratingly romantic story. But I’m going to be honest with you. It didn’t make me cry. I was told I would need...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An ambitious intern. A perfectionist executive. And a whole lot of name calling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan. He's exacting, blunt, inconsiderate—and completely irresistible. A Beautiful Bastard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocative—completely infuriating—creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rules—or outright smash them—if it means he can have her. All over the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their appetites for one another increase to a breaking point, Bennett and Chloe must decide exactly what they're willing to lose in order to win each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally only available online as &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; by tby789 — and garnering over 2 million reads on fanfiction sites — &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard&lt;/i&gt; has been extensively updated for re-release.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren’s romantic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so...inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Holland Bakker has invented excuses to descend into the subway station near her apartment, drawn to the captivating music performed by her street musician crush. Lacking the nerve to actually talk to the gorgeous stranger, fate steps in one night in the form of a drunken attacker. Calvin Mcloughlin rescues her, but quickly disappears when the police start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the only resource she has to pay the brilliant musician back, Holland gets Calvin an audition with her uncle, Broadway’s hottest musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until his reason for disappearing earlier becomes clear: he’s in the country illegally, his student visa having expired years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that her uncle needs Calvin as much as Calvin needs him, a wild idea takes hold of her. Impulsively, she marries the Irishman, her infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves and Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway—in the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting—will Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

  <description>"Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. But as the week wears on, frigid winds ship the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for--and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something has gone terribly wrong."--Page [4] cover.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The spellbinding diary of a teenage girl who escapes persecution as a witch--only to face new intolerance in a Puritan settlement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the world of young Mary Newbury, a world where simply being different can cost a person her life. Hidden until now in the pages of her diary, Mary's startling story begins in 1659, the year her beloved grandmother is hanged in the public square as a witch. Mary narrowly escapes a similar fate, only to face intolerance and new danger among the Puritans in the New World. How long can she hide her true identity? Will she ever find a place where her healing powers will not be feared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two weeks after publication, Celia Rees's WITCH CHILD spirited its way onto the Book Sense Children's Only 76 list as one of the Top 10 books that independent booksellers like to handsell. Within a month, this riveting book sold out its first two hardcover printings. Now, Candlewick Press is pleased to announce the publication of WITCH CHILD in paperback.</description>

  <description>With the dead of a bitter Vermont winter closing in, evil is alive and well …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Rath thought he was done with murder when he turned in his detective's badge to become a private investigator and raise a daughter alone. Then the police in his remote rural community of Canaan find an '89 Monte Carlo abandoned by the side of the road, and the beautiful teenage girl who owned the car seems to have disappeared without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Rath's investigation brings him face-to-face with the darkest abominations of the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the consequences of his violent and painful past plaguing him, and young women with secrets vanishing one by one, he discovers once again that even in the smallest towns on the map, evil lurks everywhere-and no one is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morally complex, seething with wickedness and mystery, and rich in gritty atmosphere and electrifying plot turns, The Silent Girls marks the return of critically acclaimed author Eric Rickstad. Readers of Ian Rankin, Jo Nesbø, and Greg Iles will love this book and find themselves breathless at the incendiary, ambitious, and unforgettable story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors--a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all--a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately focuses on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family--a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Philippa Gregory comes the stunning first novel of a thrilling trilogy about the Lacey family, and the captivating woman at the heart of a power-hungry estate willing to go to any means to protect her family name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beatrice Lacey, as strong-minded as she is beautiful, refuses to conform to the social customs of her time. Destined to lose her heritage and beloved Wideacre estate once she is wed, Beatrice will use any means necessary to protect her ancestral name. Seduction, betrayal, even murder--Beatrice's passion is without apology or conscience. "She is a Lacey of Wideacre," her father warns, "and whatever she does, however she behaves, will always be fitting." Yet even as Beatrice's scheming seems about to yield her dream, she is haunted by the one living person who knows the extent of her plans...and her capacity for evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sumptuously set in Georgian England from the "queen of royal fiction" (&lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Wideacre&lt;/i&gt; is intensely gripping, rich in texture, and full of color and authenticity. It is a saga as irresistible in its singular magic as its heroine.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My name is Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith, and my age is three hundred and eighty-four years. Each new settlement asks for a new journal, and so this Book of Shadows begins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring of 1628, the Witchfinder of Wessex finds himself a true Witch. As Bess Hawksmith watches her mother swing from the Hanging Tree she knows that only one man can save her from the same fate at the hands of the panicked mob: the Warlock Gideon Masters, and his Book of Shadows. Secluded at his cottage in the woods, Gideon instructs Bess in the Craft, awakening formidable powers she didn't know she had and making her immortal. She couldn't have foreseen that even now, centuries later, he would be hunting her across time, determined to claim payment for saving her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In present-day England, Elizabeth has built a quiet life for herself, tending her garden and selling herbs and oils at the local farmers' market. But her solitude abruptly ends when a teenage girl called Tegan starts hanging around. Against her better judgment, Elizabeth begins teaching Tegan the ways of the Hedge Witch, in the process awakening memories—and demons—long thought forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part historical romance, part modern fantasy, &lt;i&gt;The Witch’s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, compelling take on the magical, yet dangerous world of Witches. Readers will long remember the fiercely independent heroine who survives plagues, wars, and the heartbreak that comes with immortality to remain true to herself, and protect the protégé she comes to love.</description>

  <description>Though born without great beauty, wealth, or title, Anne Boleyn blossomed into a captivating woman. She used her wiles to win the heart of England's most powerful man, King Henry VIII, and persuade him to defy everyone--including his own wife—to make her his new queen. But Anne's ambition was her fatal flaw. This is the true story of the girl everyone loved to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Carolyn Meyer's engrossing third novel in the award-winning Young Royals series tells Anne's fascinating story in her own voice—from her life as an awkward girl to the dramatic moments before her death.</description>

  <description>Called La Jardiniere, a resourceful and clever jester to the queen's court, Nicola was a most unlikely person to end up "fool" and friend to Mary, Queen of Scots. But Nicola isn't an ordinary comedian clowning before the court; her sharp tongue is rare amongst the fawning nobles. As fate takes Mary from France to Scotland, and into confrontations with rebellious lords and devious advisors, Nicola remains deep in the queen's inner circle. But when the Scots start to turn on Queen Mary, Nicola struggles to find something-anything-that she, just a fool, can do to save her friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Rich and involving . . . Readers are treated to a fascinating look at royal politics through the eyes of Nicola." (&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal, starred review&lt;/i&gt;)</description>

  <description>Ah, Christmas! Gemma Doyle is looking forward to a holiday from Spence Academy, spending time with her friends in the city, attending ritzy balls, and on a somber note, tending to her ailing father. As she prepares to ring in the New Year, 1896, a handsome young man, Lord Denby, has set his sights on Gemma, or so it seems. Yet amidst the distractions of London, Gemma’s visions intensify–visions of three girls dressed in white, to whom something horrific has happened, something only the realms can explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lure is strong, and before long, Gemma, Felicity, and Ann are turning flowers into butterflies in the enchanted world of the realms that Gemma alone can bring them to. To the girls’ great joy, their beloved Pippa is there as well, eager to complete their circle of friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is not well in the realms–or out. The mysterious Kartik has reappeared, telling Gemma she must find the Temple and bind the magic, else great disaster will befall her. Gemma’s willing to do his intrusive bidding, despite the dangers it brings, for it means she will meet up with her mother’s greatest friend–and now her foe, Circe. Until Circe is destroyed, Gemma cannot live out her destiny. But finding Circe proves a most perilous task.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.</description>

  <description>England, 1776: Lord Gareth de Montforte is known as an irresponsible rake with a heart of gold. When he takes a bullet for boldly thwarting a stagecoach robbery, he is stunned to discover that the beautiful young woman he has heroically rescued, Juliet Paige, is his deceased brother’s American fiancée, accompanied by her infant daughter. Despite his brother the duke's refusal to acknowledge Juliet, Gareth is determined to do right by the courageous woman who crossed an ocean to give her baby her rightful name. But Juliet is wary of marrying this black sheep aristocrat, even while she is hopelessly charmed by the dashing devil. Never has she met anyone who embraces life so thoroughly, who makes her laugh, who loves her so well. And, even when it seems the odds are against them, Juliet has absolute faith that Gareth will go beyond the call of duty, risking his life itself to give her and her daughter a home — and a love that will last a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

      <![CDATA[So...I have a confession to make. When I was a preteen, I didn’t like to read. Probably because I wasn’t very good at it (Like Levy) Plus with all the required reading that school would assign, there wasn’t much room for fun.

  <description>About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.</description>

  <description>As soon as Anne Shirley arrives at the snug white farmhouse called Green Gables, she is sure she wants to stay forever . . . but will the Cuthberts send her back to to the orphanage? Anne knows she's not what they expected—a skinny girl with fiery red hair and a temper to match. If only she can convince them to let her stay, she'll try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes and blurting out the first thing that comes to her mind. Anne is not like anyone else, the Cuthberts agree; she is special—a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreams of the day when she can call herself Anne of Green Gables.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Swan Song&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the rest of his family, Louis is a trumpeter swan. But unlike his four brothers and sisters, Louis can't trumpet joyfully. In fact, he can't even make a sound. And since he can't trumpet his love, the beautiful swan Serena pays absolutely no attention to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louis tries everything he can think of to win Serena's affection—he even goes to school to learn to read and write. But nothing seems to work. Then his father steals him a real brass trumpet. Is a musical instrument the key to winning Louis his love?</description>

  <description>Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt;. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that Alcott based &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Introducing one of the most famous characters in literature, Jean Valjean—the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread—Les Misérables ranks among the greatest novels of all time. In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.</description>

  <description>In this debut gothic novel mysterious visions, dark family secrets and a long-lost diary thrust Gemma and her classmates back into the horrors that followed her from India. (Ages 12+)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1895, and after the suicide of her mother, 16-year-old Gemma Doyle is shipped off from the life she knows in India to Spence, a proper boarding school in England. Lonely, guilt-ridden, and prone to visions of the future that have an uncomfortable habit of coming true, Gemma's reception there is a chilly one. To make things worse, she's been followed by a mysterious young Indian man, a man sent to watch her. But why? What is her destiny? And what will her entanglement with Spence's most powerful girls—and their foray into the spiritual world—lead to?</description>

  <description>Orphaned Kit Tyler knows, as she gazes for the first time at the cold, bleak shores of Connecticut Colony, that her new home will never be like the shimmering Caribbean island she left behind. In her relatives' stern Puritan community, she feels like a tropical bird that has flown to the wrong part of the world, a bird that is now caged and lonely. The only place where Kit feels completely free is in the meadows, where she enjoys the company of the old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, and on occasion, her young sailor friend Nat. But when Kit's friendship with the "witch" is discovered, Kit is faced with suspicion, fear, and anger. She herself is accused of witchcraft!</description>

  <description>Margaret Mitchell's monumental epic of the South won a Pulitzer Prize, gave rise to the most popular motion picture of our time, and inspired a sequel that became the fastest selling novel of the century. It is one of the most popular books ever written: more than 28 million copies of the book have been sold in more than 37 countries. Today, more than 60 years after its initial publication, its achievements are unparalleled, and it remains the most revered American saga and the most beloved work by an American writer...&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>
