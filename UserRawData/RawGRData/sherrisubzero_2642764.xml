  <description>When a sadistic act of violence leaves a woman dead...&lt;br /&gt;When a tainted piece of evidence lets her killer walk...How far would you go to see justice done?&lt;br /&gt;From "New York Times" bestselling author Tami Hoag comes a taut, terrifying thriller as chilling as "Night Sins," as nerve-shattering as "Guilty as Sin." When murder erupts in a small Southern town, Tami Hoag leads readers on a frightening journey to the shadowy boundary between attraction and obsession, law and justice--and exposes the rage that lures people over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamela Bichon's killer is free, the case against him dismissed on a technicality. In the eyes of the law it doesn't matter that the prosecutor's key piece of evidence proves Marcus Renard's guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt. All that matters is that the evidence was never listed on a search warrant and it was seized by a detective with a questionable past and a nasty reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the investigation isn't over--not for Cajun cop Nick Fourcade, who stands accused of planting the evidence. He's stepped over the line before and this case could push him over the edge. His orders are to move on, but obsession fills his mind with the nightmare images of Pamela Bichon's agonizing death, of Marcus Renard's arrogant triumph, and of his own capacity for exacting vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deputy Annie Broussard can't walk away from the homicide either. She found the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She still hears the phantom echoes of dying screams, still feels the shadow of a woman taken by violence and denied justice. But pursuing the investigation will mean forming an uneasy alliance with Fourcade, a man she doesn't trust. It will mean subjecting herself to growing harassment from her fellow cops. And it will mean letting herself be drawn into the confidence of a suspected killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Fourcade challenges her again and again to reach deeper into the case and into her own soul, Annie will find herself at the center of a maze of treachery and deceit. And the closer she draws to the brutal truth, the deadlier the chase will become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for the truth has begun--one that will lead down a twisted trail through the steamy bayous of Louisiana, and deep into the darkest reaches of the human heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Chilling [and] atmospheric."&lt;br /&gt; "--US Magazine" &lt;br /&gt;"Patricia Cornwell, eat your heart out! Tami Hoag's bestselling new murder mystery sets a standard in suspense."&lt;br /&gt; "--Atlanta Journal" &lt;br /&gt;"Hoag deftly demonstrates that the search for truth is rarely straightforward. Important clues are cunningly buried, and the book's tension is as sustained as it is palpable."&lt;br /&gt; "--Chicago Tribune" &lt;br /&gt;"This mystery defies you to put it down, and when you're done you're damn glad you didn't."&lt;br /&gt; "--Detroit News and Free Press" &lt;br /&gt;"Hoag's tale, with plenty of twists and turns, is a great way to spend a quiet weekend."&lt;br /&gt; "--The Orlando Sentinel" &lt;br /&gt;"Hoag tells her story masterfully."&lt;br /&gt; "--Mostly Murder"</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Scotland, 1311. James MacLeod was the most respected---and feared---laird in all of Scotland. He loved his men like brothers and his land with a passion. And he allowed no women to cross the threshold of his keep...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City, 1996. With an indifferent fiancé and a stalled writing career, Elizabeth Smith found passion and adventure only in the unpublished romance novels that she wrote. Until a Scottish hero began calling to her...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth longed for the man of her dreams. But she knew she was overworked when she began hearing his voice---when she was awake. To clear her mind, she took a walk in Gramercy Park. She dozed off on a bench---and woke up in a lush forest in fourteenth-century Scotland. A forest surrounding the castle of James MacLeod, an arrogant and handsome lord with a very familiar voice. Elizabeth would turn his ordered world upside-down and go where no woman had ever gone before: straight into his heart...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time... as a fair maiden lay weeping upon a cold tombstone, her heartfelt desire was suddenly made real before her: tall, broad of shoulder, attired in gleaming silver and gold, her knight in shining armor had come to rescue his damsel in distress...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by a cruel fate, lovely Dougless Montgomery lies weeping upon a cold tombstone in an English church. Suddenly, the most extraordinary man appears. It is Nicholas Stafford, Earl of Thornwyck…and according to his tombstone he died in 1564!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn to his side by a bond so sudden and compelling it overshadows reason, Dougless knows that Nicholas is nothing less than a miracle: a man who does not seek to change her, who finds her perfect, fascinating, just as she is. What Dougless never imagined was how strong the chains are that tie them to the past…or the grand adventure that lay before them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR AVENGER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR ACCUSED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A IS FOR ALIBI&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A" Is for Alibi&lt;br /&gt;"B" Is for Burglar&lt;br /&gt;"C" Is for Corpse&lt;br /&gt;"D" Is for Deadbeat&lt;br /&gt;"E" Is for Evidence&lt;br /&gt;"F" Is for Fugitive&lt;br /&gt;"G" Is for Gumshoe&lt;br /&gt;"H" Is for Homicide&lt;br /&gt;"I" Is for Innocent&lt;br /&gt;"J" Is for Judgment&lt;br /&gt;"K" Is for Killer&lt;br /&gt;"L" is for Lawless&lt;br /&gt;"M" Is for Malice&lt;br /&gt;"N" Is for Noose&lt;br /&gt;"O" Is for Outlaw&lt;br /&gt;"P" Is for Peril &lt;br /&gt;"Q" Is for Quarry&lt;br /&gt;"R" Is for Ricochet &lt;br /&gt;"S" Is for Silence &lt;br /&gt;"T" Is for Trespass&lt;br /&gt;"U" Is for Undertow &lt;br /&gt;"V" Is for Vengeance &lt;br /&gt;"W" Is for Wasted &lt;br /&gt;"X" &lt;br /&gt; “Y” Is for Yesterday&lt;br /&gt;The letter Z was unfinished at the time of her death 12/28/2017</description>

  <description>Although business has been slow lately for P.I. Kinsey Millhone, she's reluctant to take on the case of locating Beverly Danziger's sister Elaine Boldt. It's a small matter that Beverly should be able to handle herself. So why is she enlisting Kinsey's services? Beverly claims she needs Elaine's signature on some documents so that she can collect a small inheritance. But the whole affair doesn't sit well with Kinsey. And if there's something she's learned in her line of work, it's to always follow your instincts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinsey's hunch proves true when she begins her inquiries into Elaine's whereabouts and discovers that the attractive widow was last seen in a flashy lynx coat boarding a plane for Boca Raton. But the more Kinsey searches for Elaine the more questions she encounters. Is Elaine's disappearance tied in to the brutal murder several months ago of one of her bridge partners? And what happened to Elaine's Persian cat who seems to have also vanished?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things take a turn for the worse when a stranger vandalizes the home of one of Elaine's neighbors and another neighbor turns up murdered. With her reputation and career on the line, Kinsey risks all to find a missing woman and a killer who's waiting in the shadows to strike again…</description>

  <description>C IS FOR CALCULATED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you go about solving an attempted murder when the victim has lost a good part of his memory? It's one of Kinsey's toughest cases yet, but she never backs down from a challenge. Twenty-three-year-old Bobby Callahan is lucky to be alive after a car forced his Porsche over a bridge and into a canyon. The crash left Bobby with a clouded memory. But he can't shake the feeling it was no random accident and that he's still in danger…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C IS FOR CRIME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only clues Kinsey has to go on are a little red address book and the name "Blackman." Bobby can't remember who he gave the address book to for safekeeping. And any chances of Bobby regaining his memory are dashed when he's killed in another automobile accident just three days after he hires Kinsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C IS FOR CORPSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kinsey digs deeper into her investigation, she discovers Bobby had a secret worth killing for―and unearthing that secret could send Kinsey to her own early death…</description>

  <description>When Alvin Limardo walks into P.I. Kinsey Millhone's office, she smells bad news. He wants Kinsey to deliver $25,000. The recipient: A fifteen-year-old boy. It's a simple matter. So simple that Kinsey wonders why he doesn't deliver the money himself. She's almost certain something is off. But with rent due, Kinsey accepts Limardo's retainer against her better judgment…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Limardo's check bounces, Kinsey discovers she's been had big time. Alvin Limardo is really John Daggett—an ex-con with a drinking problem, two wives to boot, and a slew of people who would like to see him dead. Now Kinsey is out four hundred dollars and in hot pursuit of Daggett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Daggett's corpse shows up floating in the Santa Teresa surf, the cops rule the death an accident. Kinsey thinks it's murder. But seeking justice for a man who everyone seemed to despise is going to be a lot tougher than she bargained for—and what awaits her at the end of the road is much more disturbing than she could've ever imagined…</description>

  <description>Anyone who knows me will tell you that I cherish my unmarried state. I’m female, twice divorced, no kids and no close family ties. I’m perfectly content to do what I do . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was two days after Christmas when Kinsey Millhone received the bank slip showing a credit for five thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The account number was correct but Kinsey hadn’t made the deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the phone call and suddenly everything became clear. The frame-up was working and Kinsey was trapped . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Floral Beach wasn't much of a town: six streets long and three deep, its only notable feature a strip of sand fronting the Pacific. It was on that sandy beach seventeen years ago that the strangled body of Jean Timberlake had been found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of floral Beach didn't pay a whole lot of mind to past history, especially when Bailey Fowler, the self-confessed killer, had been properly processed and convicted. They weren't even unduly concerned when, a year after the murder, Fowler walked away from the men's prison at San Luis Obispo, never to be seen again. After all, everyone knew Jean had been a wild kid. "Like mother, like daughter," some said--though never within hearing of Shana Timberlake, who, whatever her faults, still mourned her murdered child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, by sheer fluke, the cops stumbled on Bailey Fowler. And a case seventeen years dead came murderously to life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Royce Fowler, old and sick with not much time left, his son's reappearance was the chance to heal an old wound. For Kinsey Millhone, the case was a long shot, but she agreed to take it on. She couldn't know then it would lead her to probe the passions buried just below the surface of family relations, where old wounds fester and the most cherished emotions become warped until they fuse into deadly, soul-destroying time bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Good and bad things seem to be coming in threes for Kinsey Millhone: on her thirty-third birthday she moves back into her renovated apartment, gets hired to find an elderly lady supposedly living in the Mojave Desert by herself, and makes the top of ex-con Tyrone Patty's hit list. It's the last that convinces Kinsey even she can't handle whoever's been hired to whack her, and she gets herself a bodyguard: Robert Dietz, a Porsche-driving P.I. who takes guarding Kinsey's body very seriously. With Dietz watching her for the merest sign of her usual recklessness, Kinsey plunges into her case. And before it's over, she'll unearth the gruesome truth about a long-buried betrayal and, in the process, come fact-to-face with her own mortality. . .</description>

  <description>H IS FOR HUSTLER…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When PI Kinsey Millhone's good friend and colleague Parnell Perkins is found murdered in the parking lot behind California Fidelity Insurance, she can't believe he had any enemies. The only clue that raises a red flag for Kinsey is one of Parnell's files on a Bibianna Diaz, who appears to have made a lucrative career out of scamming insurance companies with phony claims…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H IS FOR HAZARDOUS…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking an alias, Kinsey goes undercover to befriend Bibianna, hoping she'll get close enough to catch the con artist at her own game. But Kinsey never dreams that hanging out with Bibianna will get them both thrown in jail. And when they're released, Bibianna's very jealous, very dangerous ex-fiancé Raymond Maldonado is waiting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H IS FOR HOMICIDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinsey soon discovers the short-tempered thug is the kingpin behind Bibianna's and countless other phony insurance claims. But was Raymond also responsible for Parnell's death? All Kinsey knows is that she'll have to think quick to nab one of the most treacherous criminals she's come face to face with―and keep herself alive…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alex’s love life is a disaster. Will accepting a crazy seven-step dating challenge lead to more heartbreak or help her find Mr Right?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex is tired of getting ghosted. After years of disastrous hook-ups and relationships that lead to the bedroom but nowhere else, Alex is convinced she’s destined to be eternally single. Then her newly married friend Stacey recommends what worked for her: a self-help book that guarantees Alex will find true love in just seven steps. Sounds simple, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except Alex soon discovers that each step is more difficult than the last, and one of the rules involves dating, but not sleeping with a guy for six months. Absolutely no intimate contact whatsoever. Zero. Nada. Rien. A big challenge for Alex, who has never been one to hold back from jumping straight into the sack, hoping it will help a man fall for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will any guys be willing to wait? Will Alex find her Mr Right? And if she does, will she be strong enough to resist temptation and hold out for true love?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join Alex on her roller coaster romantic journey as she tries to cope with the emotional and physical ups and downs of dating whilst following a lengthy list of rigid rules.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only When It’s Love is a standalone, fun, feel-good, romantic comedy by British author Olivia Spring, about self-acceptance, determination, love and the challenge of finding the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.oliviaspring.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.oliviaspring.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Follow Olivia on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @ospringauthor #OnlyWhenItsLove</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Addie Greyborne loved working with rare books at the Boston Public Library—she even got to play detective, tracking down clues about mysterious old volumes. But she didn't expect her sleuthing skills to come in so handy in a little seaside town . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie left some painful memories behind in the big city, including the unsolved murder of her fiancé and her father's fatal car accident. After an unexpected inheritance from a great aunt, she's moved to a small New England town founded by her ancestors back in colonial times—and living in spacious Greyborne Manor, on a hilltop overlooking the harbor. Best of all, her aunt also left her countless first editions and other treasures—providing an inventory to start her own store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's trouble from day one, and not just from the grumpy woman who runs the bakery next door. A car nearly runs Addie down. Someone steals a copy of &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;. Then, Addie's friend Serena, who owns a nearby tea shop, is arrested—for killing another local merchant. The police seem pretty sure they've got the story in hand, but Addie's not going to let them close the book on this case without a fight . .</description>

  <description>THEN&lt;br /&gt;She was fifteen, her mother's golden girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. And then, in the blink of an eye, Ellie was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW &lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Ellie disappeared, but Laurel has never given up hope of finding her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day a charming and charismatic stranger called Floyd walks into a café and sweeps Laurel off her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before too long she’s staying the night at this house and being introduced to his nine year old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy is precocious and pretty - and meeting her completely takes Laurel's breath away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Poppy is the spitting image of Ellie when she was that age. And now all those unanswered questions that have haunted Laurel come flooding back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Ellie? Where did she go? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who still has secrets to hide?</description>

  <description>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;October 1946, Clanton, Mississippi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pete Banning was Clanton, Mississippi's favorite son--a decorated World War II hero, the patriarch of a prominent family, a farmer, father, neighbor, and a faithful member of the Methodist church. Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, walked into the church, and calmly shot and killed his pastor and friend, the Reverend Dexter Bell. As if the murder weren't shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete's only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: "I have nothing to say." He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave.&lt;br /&gt; In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete's defense attorney tries desperately to save him. &lt;br /&gt; Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, &lt;i&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/i&gt; would not be complete without Grisham's signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.</description>

  <description>For the first time ever, the leader of the Viking Vampire Angels, Vikar Sigurdsson, has been talked into celebrating a traditional Christmas! The tree has been decorated, the gifts have been wrapped, and the stockings have been hung. And that's mistletoe, not cobwebs, hanging from the ceiling of the creepy castle full of vangels … really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the vampire cookie comes when vangel Karl Mortensen rescues Faith Larson, a battered young waitress, from her abusive boyfriend and hides her in the castle amidst the Christmas chaos. But what Karl thought was a frail young teenager is actually a very tempting woman. And she thinks his fangs are sexy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a strange "Christmas visitor" at the castle and demon vampires up to their old tricks could threaten the budding romance between Karl and Faith. It's an impossible match—a human and a vangel—but Christmas is a time for magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl and Faith don't stand a chance …</description>

  <description>The Texter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallen San Francisco homicide detective, Jack Slaughter, closes the door on the home where his perfect family has been brutally snatched from him. Moving across the city, he works as a private investigator to fund his own investigation into what happened to his family—who killed his little girl, Zoë, and where is his wife, Leah?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every three month for the last three years, Jack receives a simple text telling him where he can find his missing wife. There’s a body at each location, but none of them are Leah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack hates missing person’s cases, but they’re his bread and butter. He only takes the case to find Carl Boyd's missing wife because the details of her disappearance closely match Leah’s. He hopes by finding Bonnie Boyd, he'll find his own wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butcher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the leads in the Bonnie Boyd case, Jack discovers someone has been killing women all over the city for the last three years, a fact Jack’s ex-partner and still best friend, Ray Navarro, has neglected to tell him. The city has a serial killer and officials haven’t been able to find a single lead on the person they’ve dubbed The Butcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could Bonnie Boyd’s disappearance be linked to The Butcher? More important, was Leah one of The Butcher’s victims? Could he have gone so far as to murder a child? With every clue Jack weaves together, his own life unravels even more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deliciously disturbing, compulsively readable debut domestic suspense—prepare to meet &lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt;: there’s nothing she won’t do to keep you away from her son...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily thinks Adam’s perfect; the man she thought she’d never meet. But lurking in the shadows is a rival; a woman who shares a deep bond with the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily chose Adam, but she didn’t choose his mother Pammie. There’s nothing a mother wouldn’t do for her son, and now Emily is about to find out just how far Pammie will go to get what she wants: Emily gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt; is an addictive, fast-paced psychological thriller about the destructive relationship between Emily, her boyfriend Adam, and his manipulative mother Pammie.</description>

  <description>Catriona Masterton's fiancé, Ethan, is Normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He plans trips six months in advance and arrives at the airport a minimum of three hours early. He purchases life insurance, luggage insurance, and always opts for the extended warranty. He's responsible, reliable, and would make any woman a wonderful life partner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, he's the exact opposite of the Masterton clan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat's mother has a kitchen gadget fetish, a father whose best friends are taxidermied field mice, and a super stoner man-child brother who lives--where else?--in the basement. Then there's Nan, her proud Scottish grandmother with a proclivity for profanity and mischief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What on earth will Catriona's Normal fiancé think when he comes home with her to meet her parents? What will he think when he discovers his soon-to-be in-laws invited Cat's ex to join them for Thanksgiving dinner? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find out in a laugh-out-loud journey of self-discovery, familial pandemonium, and love. A must read for fans of a true romantic comedy!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Holly White's fiance cancels their Christmas Eve wedding with less than two weeks to go, Holly heads home with a broken heart. Lucky for her, home in historic Mistletoe, Maine is magical during Christmastime--exactly what the doctor prescribed. Except her plan to drown her troubles in peppermints and snickerdoodles is upended when local grouch and president of the Mistletoe Historical Society Margaret Fenwick is bludgeoned and left in the sleigh display at Reindeer Games, Holly's family tree farm. &lt;br /&gt;When the murder weapon is revealed as one of the wooden stakes used to identify trees on the farm, Sheriff Evan Grey turns to Holly's father, Bud, and the Reindeer Games staff. And it doesn't help that Bud and the reindeer keeper were each seen arguing with Margaret just before her death. But Holly knows her father, and is determined to exonerate him.The jingle bells are ringing, the clock is ticking, and if Holly doesn't watch out, she'll end up on Santa's naughty list in &lt;i&gt;Twelve Slays of Christmas&lt;/i&gt;, Jacqueline Frost's jolly series debut.</description>

  <description>The truth has no place in a courtroom. The truth doesn't matter in a trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that matters is what the prosecution can prove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Flynn used to be a con artist. Then he became a lawyer. Turned out the two weren't that different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been over a year since Eddie vowed never to set foot in a courtroom again. But now he doesn't have a choice. Olek Volchek, the infamous head of the Russian mafia in New York, has strapped a bomb to Eddie's back and kidnapped his ten-year-old daughter Amy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie only has 48 hours to defend Volchek in an impossible murder trial—and win—if wants to save his daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the scrutiny of the media and the FBI, Eddie must use his razor-sharp wit and every con-artist trick in the book to defend his 'client' and ensure Amy's safety. With the timer on his back ticking away, can Eddie convince the jury of the impossible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose this case and he loses everything.</description>

  <description>An unspeakable crime. A confounding investigation. At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>It was a stab in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a chilly February night, during a screening of &lt;i&gt;Psycho&lt;/i&gt; in midtown, someone sunk an ice pick into the back of Chanel Rylan’s neck, then disappeared quietly into the crowds of drunks and tourists in Times Square. To Chanel’s best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanel’s blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crime—from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesn’t think it’s coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs. But this killer seems to find inspiration in someone else’s imagination, and if the theory holds, this may be only the second of a long-running series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that Eve and her billionaire husband Roarke have an excuse to curl up in front of the fireplace with their cat, Galahad, reading mystery stories for research. The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murderer’s deranged private drama—and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong.</description>

  <description>Trouble comes in bunches for Stephanie Plum. First, professional grave robber and semi-professional loon, Simon Diggery, won’t let her take him in until she agrees to care for his boa constrictor, Ethel. Stephanie’s main qualification for babysitting an extremely large snake is that she owns a stun gun—whether that’s for use on the wandering serpent or the petrified neighbors remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events take a dark turn when headless bodies start appearing across town. At first, it’s just corpses from a funeral home and the morgue that have had the heads removed. But when a homeless man is murdered and dumped behind a church Stephanie knows that she’s the only one with a prayer of catching this killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all that’s not enough, Diesel’s back in town. The 6-foot-tall, blonde-haired hunk is a man who accepts no limits—that includes locked doors, closed windows and underwear. Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli isn’t pleased at this unexpected arrival nor is Ranger, the high-powered security consultant who has his own plans for Stephanie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual Jersey’s favorite bounty hunter is stuck in the middle with more questions than answers. What’s the deal with Grandma Mazur’s latest online paramour? Who is behind the startling epidemic of mutilated corpses? And is the enigmatic Diesel’s sudden appearance a coincidence or the cause of recent deadly events?</description>

  <description>Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer – in case he or she decides to strike again.</description>

  <description>The chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it’s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that’s exactly what happens one cold February evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described “social information reporter,” or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she’d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone’s done the same to her, literally—with a knife to the brachial artery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve didn’t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she’ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn’t want to know…</description>

  <description>A gang of thieves stage a daring heist from a secure vault deep below Princeton University’s Firestone Library. Their loot is priceless, but Princeton has insured it for twenty-five million dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Cable owns a popular bookstore in the sleepy resort town of Santa Rosa on Camino Island in Florida. He makes his real money, though, as a prominent dealer in rare books. Very few people know that he occasionally dabbles in the black market of stolen books and manuscripts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercer Mann is a young novelist with a severe case of writer’s block who has recently been laid off from her teaching position. She is approached by an elegant, mysterious woman working for an even more mysterious company. A generous offer of money convinces Mercer to go undercover and infiltrate Bruce Cable’s circle of literary friends, ideally getting close enough to him to learn his secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But eventually Mercer learns far too much, and there’s trouble in paradise as only John Grisham can deliver it.</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>Jack and Jill meet on Freshers Big Party Night at university and for both of them it’s love at first sight. Despite their backgrounds, personalities and interests being poles apart, the relationship flourishes during their university years. It’s not quite as comfortable when their studies are over and they start work, Jack in the City and Jill as a teacher. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Way back when they first met, they’d shared the joke that their names were those of the nursery rhyme. Down the line, they fail to recognise that their lives are matching the plot – Jack falls down and Jill comes tumbling after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their relationship is on the rocks. Can it survive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What reviewers say about R J Gould’s writing: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘R J Gould is a sharp, perceptive observer of human relationships, demonstrating both their fragility and their absurdity.’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I loved this book! Tender, witty, funny, with characters you can totally relate to.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I laughed from the beginning and didn't stop until the end and I couldn't put it down in between.’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A story about trust, resilience, forgiveness and fresh starts, narrated with humour and insight. It kept my interest hooked and made me smile all the way through. A great read!’ &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Nora Ephron meets &lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones's Diary&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; columnist Stella Grey’s heartrendingly honest, witty memoir about her online odyssey to find real love in a virtual world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The literary equivalent of the &lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt; line, ‘tell me I’ll never be out there again’.”—JoJo Moyes, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Me Before You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singers may croon about love being lovelier the second time around, but it can also be far more complicated. When Stella Grey’s husband leaves her for another woman, she fears she'll be unhappy and alone for the rest of her life. But daytime vodka-drinking and ice-cream are only short-term consolations. Realizing that she needs to take her future into her own hands, Stella dives into the world of online dating. What follow are 693 days of hilarious, depressing, and baffling encounters that unfold both in person and online. Stella quickly discovers that the more perfect a man appears on her screen, the warier she should be. It's a game of chance, with some players perfectly willing to lie to get what they want, whether that’s a lifetime of love or a very brief encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid flirty emails, Skype chats, and awkward small talk over glasses of bad wine (which may or may not lead to awkward sex), Stella struggles to remain optimistic. To succeed, does she have to redefine the kind of man she’s looking for—or change the kind of woman she is? Funny, raw, and heartwarming, this book is a brutally honest account of the world of online dating—a world which so many of us are a part of, no matter our age—drawn from Stella’s hugely popular &lt;em&gt;Guardian &lt;/em&gt;column, “Mid-life Ex-Wife” (and expanded with new material) about her search for a second chance at love.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Wrong Man&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eyes on You&lt;/em&gt; comes a harrowing new psychological thriller about a successful self-help author who suddenly finds her life spiraling dangerously out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you do if you realized that your new husband, a man you adore, is keeping secrets from you—secrets with terrifying consequences?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryn Harper, an accomplished self-help author, already has plenty to deal with. She’s still recovering from a devastating car accident that has left her haunted by recurring, smoke-filled nightmares. Worse still, she can’t shake the ominous feeling her dreams contain a warning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, Bryn’s husband Guy couldn’t have been more supportive. But after moving into a new house together, disturbing incidents occur and Guy grows evasive, secretive. What the hell is going on, she wonders? Then, a woman hired to cater their dinner party is brutally murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bryn’s world unravels—and yet another woman in town is slain —she must summon her old strength to find answers and protect her own life. Her nightmares may in fact hold the key to unlocking the truth and unmasking the murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unexpected, riveting twists, &lt;em&gt;The Secrets You Keep&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly compelling psychological thriller that once again showcases Kate White’s extraordinary storytelling talent.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors--a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all--a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately focuses on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family--a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Janet Evanovich, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum novels, and Lee Goldberg, bestselling author and television writer for &lt;i&gt;Monk,&lt;/i&gt; comes the first adventure in an electrifying new series featuring an FBI agent who always gets her man, and a fearless con artist who lives for the chase.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Special Agent Kate O’Hare is known for her fierce dedication and discipline on the job, chasing down the world’s most wanted criminals and putting them behind bars. Her boss thinks she is tenacious and ambitious; her friends think she is tough, stubborn, and maybe even a bit obsessed. And while Kate has made quite a name for herself for the past five years, the only name she’s cared about is Nicolas Fox—an international crook she wants in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audacious, handsome, and dangerously charming, Nicolas Fox is a natural con man, notorious for running elaborate scams on very high-profile people. At first he did it for the money. Now he does it for the thrill. He knows that the FBI has been hot on his trail—particularly Kate O’Hare, who has been watching his every move. For Nick, there’s no greater rush than being pursued by a beautiful woman . . . even one who aims to lock him up. But just when it seems that Nicolas Fox has been captured for good, he pulls off his greatest con of all: he convinces the FBI to offer him a job, working side by side with Special Agent Kate O’Hare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, teaming up to stop a corrupt investment banker who’s hiding on a private island in Indonesia is going to test O’Hare’s patience and Fox’s skill. Not to mention the skills of their ragtag team made up of flamboyant actors, wanted wheelmen, and Kate’s dad. High-speed chases, pirates, and Toblerone bars are all in a day’s work . . . if O’Hare and Fox don’t kill each other first.</description>

  <description>Young interior designer Ava O’Shea has an appointment for a first consultation at The Manor with the owner, Mr Jesse Ward. She is expecting nothing more than an overweight, cravat wearing, well-to-do countryman, and on arrival, nothing would suggest otherwise. How wrong could she be? This Man is devastatingly handsome, charming and confident. He is also a conceited, hedonistic playboy, who knows no boundaries. Ava desperately does not want to be attracted to him, but she can’t control the overwhelming effect he has on her. Every instinct is telling her to run, so she does, but Jesse Ward is not so willing to let her go. He wants her and is determined to have her. She knows she is heading for heartbreak, but how can she run when he won’t let her?</description>

  <description>Megan is a suburban soccer mom who once upon a time walked on the wild side. Now she’s got two kids, a perfect husband, a picket fence, and a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Ray used to be a talented documentary photographer, but at age forty he finds himself in a dead-end job posing as a paparazzo pandering to celebrity-obsessed rich kids. Jack is a detective who can’t let go of a cold case—a local husband and father disappeared seventeen years ago, and Jack spends the anniversary every year visiting a house frozen in time, the missing man’s family still waiting, his slippers left by the recliner as if he might show up any moment to step into them. Three people living lives they never wanted, hiding secrets that even those closest to them would never suspect, will find that the past doesn’t recede. Even as the terrible consequences of long-ago events crash together in the present and threaten to ruin lives, they will come to the startling realization that they may not want to forget the past at all. And as each confronts the dark side of the American Dream—the boredom of a nice suburban life, the excitement of temptation, the desperation and hunger that can lurk behind even the prettiest facades—they will discover the hard truth that the line between one kind of life and another can be as whisper-thin as a heartbeat. With his trademark combination of page-turning thrills and unrivaled insight into the dark shadows that creep into even the happiest communities, Harlan Coben delivers a thriller that cements his status as the master of domestic suspense.</description>

  <description>The death of internal affairs investigator Andy Paxton is a potential political bomb for the Minneapolis Police Department... Andy Paxton was gay and he was investigating a possible cop connection in the brutal murder of another gay officer. But Andy's death looks like suicide, or an unfortunate and embarrassing accident, and the pressure is on from the top brass to close the case as soon as possible. But the investigation's lead detective Sam Kovac is not convinced the case is as straightforward as it appears. As he digs deeper, it is looking very much like Paxton discovered something that got him killed. And he might not be the final victim...</description>

  <description>He performs his profane ceremony in a wooded Minneapolis park, anointing his victims, then setting the bodies ablaze. He has already claimed three lives, and he won’t stop there. Only this time there is a witness. But she isn’t talking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Kate Conlan, former FBI agent turned victim/witness advocate. Not even she can tell if the reluctant witness is a potential victim or something more troubling still. Her superiors are interested only because the latest victim may be the daughter of Peter Bondurant, an enigmatic billionaire. When Peter pulls strings, Special Agent John Quinn gets assigned to the case. But the FBI’s ace profiler of serial killers is the last person Kate wants to work with, not with their troubled history. Now she faces the most difficult role of her career—and her life. For she’s the only woman who has what it takes to stop the killer . . . and the one woman he wants next.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This chilling new suspense novel from #1 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author J.D. Robb is the perfect entry point into the compelling In Death police procedural series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As NY Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband Roarke are driving home, a young woman—dazed, naked, and bloody—suddenly stumbles out in front of their car. Roarke slams on the brakes and Eve springs into action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daphne Strazza is rushed to the ER, but it’s too late for her husband Dr. Anthony Strazza. A brilliant orthopedic surgeon, he now lies dead amid the wreckage of his obsessively organized town house, his three safes opened and emptied. Daphne would be a valuable witness, but in her terror and shock the only description of the perp she can offer is repeatedly calling him “the devil”...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it emerges that Dr. Strazza was cold, controlling, and widely disliked, this is one case where the evidence doesn’t point to the spouse. So Eve and her team must get started on the legwork, interviewing everyone from dinner-party guests to professional colleagues to caterers, in a desperate race to answer some crucial questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the devil look like? And where will he show up next?</description>

  <description>Hannah Maguire and Sudesh Kumar had been lovers in Dublin City, both studying for their degrees in similar areas of Archaeology. What she had treated as a college romance, Hannah realized, as he was leaving Dublin for the job of a lifetime back home in India, was she had lost her heart to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, five years later, Hannah is working as an archivist in the National Museum in Dublin when she's invited to the National Museum of India in New Delhi to inspect a new and rare artifact found on an archaeological dig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person she expects to see when she enters the museum is Sudesh. She didn’t know where he was, or even if he was still in India, but soon learns he's the one who made the discovery, and had been the one encouraging the museum to invite her onto the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On meeting, everything they'd shared washes over Hannah—all of the love and passion, and a heart so broken, she still hadn't recovered. To make things more difficult, it's Deepavali/Diwali and Sudesh has promises to make it a memorable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this one night really be one to remember, or will it send Hannah into a tailspin she might not recover from this time?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All I Want for Christmas&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;b&gt;big, cozy Christmas story&lt;/b&gt; about the importance of family, the strength of childhood friendships, and &lt;b&gt;learning to trust your heart&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of Carole Matthews, Susan Wiggs and Susan Mallery – and anyone who likes the glow of Christmas lights and the rustle of wrapping paper – will fall in love with this feel-good Christmas treat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christmas comes once a year . . . But true love comes once in a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snowflakes are falling, there’s carol singing on every corner, and &lt;b&gt;Leah Evans&lt;/b&gt; is preparing for a family Christmas at her grandmother’s majestic plantation house in Virginia. It won’t be the same now that her beloved Nan is gone, but when Leah discovers she has inherited the mansion, she knows she can give her daughter Sadie the childhood of her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there’s a catch. Leah must split the house with a man called &lt;b&gt;David Forester&lt;/b&gt;. Leah hasn’t heard that name in a long time. Not since they were kids, when Davey was always there to catch her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now David is all grown up. He’s gorgeous, successful, and certain of one thing: Leah should sell him her half of the house. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They can’t agree, but as they share memories over wine by the log fire, Leah notices a fluttering in her stomach. And by the look in his eyes, he’s starting to feel it too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will it be Leah or David who must give up their dreams? Or, with a little bit of Christmas magic, will they finally understand Nan’s advice to them both about living life without regrets … and take a chance on true love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What everyone’s saying about Jenny Hale’s books …  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Captured my heart from the very first page and never let it go&lt;/b&gt; … Jenny is quickly becoming &lt;b&gt;one of my favorite authors&lt;/b&gt; … One minute I’m giggling and the next there is a huge lump in my throat … My heart melted … I just wanted to reach in the pages and give them all hugs. I can’t wait to read more by this wonderful author.’ &lt;i&gt;Color Me Read&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Absolutely fantastic, I loved this book and will definitely be remembering and revisiting it in future&lt;/b&gt;. Jenny Hale is a supremely accomplished and highly talented author. I can’t wait to read more from her!’ &lt;i&gt;Splashes into Books&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;b&gt;perfect romance&lt;/b&gt; read. Full of tension and heart-wrenching feelings … Oh I really did enjoy it … One to lift my mood and &lt;b&gt;put a smile on my face and warmth in my heart … Full of charismatic characters, family love and bonds, honesty, small town loveliness and soul mates&lt;/b&gt;. Reading perfection!’ 5/5 &lt;i&gt;Pajama Book Girl&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘This book is &lt;b&gt;the epitome of everything I love about reading&lt;/b&gt;, about fiction and about romance. It was heart-warming, touching, upsetting, endearing, beautiful and one hundred other adjectives I could reel off… It’s &lt;b&gt;an absolute must-read for any romance fan&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Paris Baker’s Book Nook&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Heart-warming and hilarious, a story that will make you laugh, cry and bring a smile to your face.  Get ready for another deliciously amazing Christmas treat from Sue Watson….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Prosecco chills and Bing Crosby croons, &lt;b&gt;Jen Barker&lt;/b&gt; just knows that her long-term boyfriend is about to propose.  But instead of a diamond ring nestled in her champagne flute, Jen finds cold flat rejection.  Her once perfect life and dreams of a husband and family seem even further from reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A working holiday to the Swiss Alps with her younger sister Jody might not be the Christmas Jen had it mind, but it offers her the chance to recharge her batteries and recover from heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jen meets handsome ski instructor &lt;b&gt;Jon Zutter&lt;/b&gt; her hopes for a happy-ever-after seem within her grasp again. Jon is kind and gorgeous and as they bond over Sachetorte at the picturesque Cake Café, Jen thinks he might just be her perfect man. But a relationship with him comes with a catch – and there are some things even cake can’t fix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the snow falls and Christmas approaches, could this be the place that restores Jen Barker’s faith in love?</description>

  <description>Released from the magic pokey and paroled with limited power is enough to make any witch grumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you throw in a recently resurrected cat, a lime-green Kia and a sexy egotistical werewolf, it’s enough to make a gal fly off the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention a mission…with no freaking directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I sit in Asscrack, West Virginia trying to figure out how to complete my mysterious mission before All Hallows Eve when I’ll get turned into a mortal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animals in the area are convinced I’m the Shifter Whisperer (whatever the hell that is) and the hotter-than- asphalt-in-August werewolf thinks I’m his mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now apparently I’m slated to save a bunch of hairy freaks of nature?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they think I’m the right witch for the job, they’ve swallowed some bad brew.</description>

  <description>From the author of the beloved bestseller &lt;i&gt;Shoe Addicts Anonymous&lt;/i&gt; comes a heartwarming twist on a classic tale filled with holiday cheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noelle is not a fan of the holidays and to make matters worse, she is at a crossroads in her life when it seems that love and adventure are no longer possible. When she stays late at her job in a department store on a snowy Christmas Eve she accidentally gets locked in after closing. She isn’t too concerned about the prospect of spending the night in the store…until a woman appears out of nowhere and tells Noelle that she’s her guardian angel. Soon Noelle finds herself camped out in the shoe department facing several “ghosts” of Christmases past, present, and future...Will visiting the holidays of yesterday and tomorrow help Noelle see the true spirit of Christmas? And will the love she has longed for all her life be the best surprise gift of all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the heart of Trenton, N.J., a killer is out to make sure someone gets his just desserts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Larry Virgil skipped out on his latest court date after he was arrested for hijacking an eighteen-wheeler full of premium bourbon. Fortunately for bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, Larry is just stupid enough to attempt almost the exact same crime again. Only this time he flees the scene, leaving behind a freezer truck loaded with Bogart ice cream and a dead body—frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As fate would have it, Stephanie’s mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the Bogart factory to find out who’s putting their employees on ice and sabotaging the business. It’s going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It’s also going to be hard to explain to Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger, late nights with Lula and Randy Briggs—who are naked and afraid—and late nights keeping tabs on Grandma Mazur and her new fella. Stephanie Plum has a lot on her plate, but for a girl who claims to have “virtually no marketable skills,” these are the kinds of sweet assignments she does best.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lieutenant Eve Dallas returns in a fast-paced new novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J. D. Robb.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nature versus nurture...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shots came quickly, silently, and with deadly accuracy. Within seconds, three people were dead at Central Park’s ice skating rink. The victims: a talented young skater, a doctor, and a teacher. As random as random can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Dallas has seen a lot of killers during her time with the NYPSD, but never one like this. After reviewing security videos, it becomes clear that the victims were killed by a sniper firing a tactical laser rifle, who could have been miles away when the trigger was pulled. And though the locations where the shooter could have set up seem endless, the list of people with that particular skill set is finite: police, military, professional killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve’s husband, Roarke, has unlimited resources—and genius—at his disposal. And when his computer program leads Eve to the location of the sniper, she learns a shocking fact: There were two—one older, one younger. Someone is being trained by an expert in the science of killing, and they have an agenda. Central Park was just a warm-up. And as another sniper attack shakes the city to its core, Eve realizes that though we’re all shaped by the people around us, there are those who are just born evil...</description>

  <description>Natalie’s world is shaken to its core when she discovers an old photo of a woman who looks like her. Could this woman be related to her birth mother, who put Natalie up for adoption as a baby? When she tracks down the person who dumped the photo album at her thrift shop, she’s shaken again. Especially when the gorgeous fire-fighting guitarist offers to help her find the owner. They quickly become friends – which is all they’ll be, as far as Natalie’s concerned. Her rebellious youth turned her off cheating men, and the new Natalie is looking for true love and a family of her own – something Casey isn’t willing to provide. But how long can Natalie ignore her undeniable attraction to the man with the Irish accent and the broken-down ’57 Chevy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Chelsey Krause’s second novel, friends become lovers over a whirlwind summer of rockabilly rhythms, twirling skirts, and a mystery that takes them hilariously far out of their element.</description>

  <description>WOULD DATING BE THE DEATH OF HER?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsure if she is looking for Mr. Right, or Mr. Every Other Saturday Night, divorced mother of two, Laurel McKay reluctantly joins THE LOVE CLUB, a popular local dating service. Dressed to kill, she meets bachelor number one at a trendy restaurant. But the date is a bust, literally, when the guy decides Laurel is dessert, and she breaks his nose with her cell phone. It gets even worse when the man is found murdered the next morning, and Laurel has his blood on her clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her now being a person of interest to the police, Laurel bravely ventures out on date number two. When that unlucky bachelor disappears during dinner, Laurel’s only alibi is a bottle of Dom Perignon. The sexy investigating detective thinks she’s innocent and is worried she may be the next target. That’s more than enough motivation for Laurel to find a murderer determined to kill her social life––before dating becomes a dead end she can’t escape.</description>

  <description>Harlan Coben, the master of domestic suspense, returns with a standalone thriller in the vein of #1 bestsellers Hold Tight, Caught and Stay Close that explores the depth and passion of a lost love . . . and the secrets and lies at its heart. Six years have passed since Jake Fisher watched Natalie, the love of his life, marry another man. Six years of hiding a broken heart by throwing himself into his career as a college professor. Six years of keeping his promise to leave Natalie alone, and six years of tortured dreams of her life with her new husband, Todd. But six years haven’t come close to extinguishing his feelings, and when Jake comes across Todd’s obituary, he can’t keep himself away from the funeral. There he gets the glimpse of Todd’s wife he’s hoping for . . . but she is not Natalie. Whoever the mourning widow is, she’s been married to Todd for more than a decade, and with that fact everything Jake thought he knew about the best time of his life—a time he has never gotten over—is turned completely inside out. As Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel. Mutual friends of the couple either can’t be found or don’t remember Jake. No one has seen Natalie in years. Jake’s search for the woman who broke his heart—and who lied to him—soon puts his very life at risk as it dawns on him that the man he has become may be based on carefully constructed fiction. Harlan Coben once again delivers a shocking page-turner that deftly explores the power of past love and the secrets and lies that such love can hide.</description>

  <description>Dexter Yates loves his fun, care-free London life; he has money, looks and girlfriends galore. But everything changes overnight when his sister dies, leaving him in charge of her eight-month-old daughter Delphi. How is he ever going to cope?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comic-strip artist Molly Hayes lives in the beautiful Cotswold village of Briarwood. When it comes to relationships, she has a history of choosing all the wrong men. Leaving the city behind, Dex moves to Briarwood - a much better place to work on his parenting skills - and he and Molly become neighbours. There's an undeniable connection between them. But if Dexter's going to adapt, he first has a lot to learn about Molly, about other people's secrets...and about himself.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.&lt;br /&gt;--scholastic.com</description>

  <description>Dennis Mira just had two unpleasant surprises. First he learned that his cousin Edward was secretly meeting with a real estate agent about their late grandfather’s magnificent West Village brownstone, despite the promise they both made to keep it in the family. Then, when he went to the house to confront Edward about it, he got a blunt object to the back of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Dennis is married to Charlotte Mira, the NYPSD’s top profiler and a good friend of Lieutenant Eve Dallas. When the two arrive on the scene, he explains that the last thing he saw was Edward in a chair, bruised and bloody. When he came to, his cousin was gone. With the mess cleaned up and the security disks removed, there’s nothing left behind but a few traces for forensics to analyze. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former lawyer, judge, and senator, Edward Mira mingled with the elite and crossed paths with criminals, making enemies on a regular basis. Like so many politicians, he also made some very close friends behind closed—and locked—doors. But a badge and a billionaire husband can get you into places others can’t go, and Eve intends to shine some light on the dirty deals and dark motives behind the disappearance of a powerful man, the family discord over a multimillion-dollar piece of real estate . . . and a new case that no one saw coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;PMS can be a real witch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivie McKie isn’t your run-of-the-mill kindergarten teacher. After an encounter with a horny goat, followed by a confrontation with her lying, cheating fiancé, Ivie is shocked when the big jerk suddenly transforms into a skunk—the black and white furry variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisting the help of her shopaholic friend Chloe and sexy club magician Jackson Blake, Ivie is forced to play a literal game of cat and mouse as she races against the clock to change her ex back before she's arrested for his murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every new spell comes a fresh wave of sexual desire, drawing Jack further into Ivie’s troubles—her panties, the car, the kitchen, and assorted seedy bathrooms along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivie soon discovers what every witch worth her spell book knows: There’s nothing worse than a bad case of Post Magical Syndrome.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Treat yourself to some extra romance with this exclusive, straight-to-digital short story from the&lt;i&gt; Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; No. 1 Bestseller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jo’s friend Andi asks if she’ll stand in to cook Christmas lunch for her employer, Jo reluctantly agrees. She knows Andi will lose her job if she doesn’t, and wants to help out her friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo is nervous because Andi’s boss is a well-known celebrity diva, who outright refuses to have anyone but Andi cook for her. But she also insists Andi wears full chefs whites so the girls think they’ll get away with it … it’s the perfect Christmas disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jo runs into one of the guests - good looking and very smart Anthony - things get even more complicated…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus the first chance to read the opening chapter of Katie's novel, &lt;i&gt;A Summer at Sea.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This holiday season has bite.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Prescott hates Christmas—he’s a vampire, and to him, there’s certainly nothing jolly about the holiday season. While the humans are running around being merry, he’s hunting in the shadows. Ben plans to spend the holidays his way…by stalking deadly prey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But fate has other plans for Ben.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three visitors are coming Ben’s way…A demon who will force Ben to face his past, a ghost who will show Ben the present he could have, and a shifter who will reveal the darkness that waits in Ben’s future. Unless Ben can change his ways, he may just turn into a real monster, one who can’t be saved by anyone or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;’Tis the season…to be undead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben’s redemption rests in the hands of the one woman he loved and lost—Simone Laurent. If Ben is going to have a chance at being more than just the beast in the darkness, he has to prove himself to the lovely Simone. A very hard task, considering that, once upon a Christmas Eve, Simone died in Ben’s arms… &lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book features one very tortured vampire, a sexy ghost from his past, and hot scenes designed to melt the winter snow. Plenty of action, adult situations, and steamy times are ahead. Happy holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately 23,000 words</description>

Her suave and successful ex-boyfriend who she finds so irresistible? Or the exciting new stranger who has just waltzed into her life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this Christmas be a fresh start? Or will she be dragged back to the memories of Last Christmas? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Last Christmas’ is a heart-warming, witty and modern take on the classic love triangle story – the perfect romance to curl up to the fire with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bella Bradley is the queen of television baking – a national treasure. Her Christmas specials have been topping the ratings for years and her marriage to Peter ‘Silver Fox’ Bradley is the stuff of Hello magazine specials. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year things are going to be different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Amy Lane, Bella’s best friend from school, life hasn’t held quite the same sparkle. And when Amy’s husband walks out three weeks from Christmas, it seems their lives are further apart than ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy has watched Bella’s rise to fame fondly, despite the fact Bella was always a terrible cook. But when she realises that Bella’s latest Christmas book is made up entirely of Amy’s mother’s recipes, the gloves are off… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After winning a competition to appear on Bella’s TV show, Amy is going to make sure that for Bella and her viewers, this will definitely be a Christmas to remember… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hilarious, heart-breaking and feel good read about best friends, baking and the magic of Christmas.</description>

  <description>An uplifting, beautiful story about never letting go of your dreams, the special magic of a family Christmas… and the rush of falling in love under the mistletoe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mother Abbey Fuller loves her family more than anything, and doesn’t regret for a moment having had to put her dreams of being an interior designer on hold. But with her son, Max, growing up, when a friend recommends her for a small design job she jumps at the chance. How hard can it be? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Sinclair needs his house decorated in time for his family’s festive visit – and money is no object. What he doesn’t need is to be distracted from his multi-million dollar business – even if it is Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abbey pulls up to the huge Sinclair mansion, she has a feeling she might be out of her depth. And when she meets the gorgeous, brooding Nicholas Sinclair, she knows that she’s in real trouble… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the snow falling all around, can Abbey take the chance to make her dreams of being a designer come true? And can she help Nick to finally enjoy the magic of Christmas?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00QORX032&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy, a young, American woman, has moved to Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the town centre at Christmastime, she rather clumsily falls to the ground. She looks up to see the most handsome face she had ever seen. Nate. It was love at first fall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a gardener at Friar Park, but things don’t seem to add up, as he is constantly jumping into black sports cars, using code names, and hiding her from his friends. At other times, he is the perfect gentleman; wining and dining her at fancy restaurants, zipping around on their scooters, and wooing her with his British wit and banter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he tell her the truth, or will she end up alone at Christmas? This is another romantic comedy filled with flirting and fun by Sophie Sloane.</description>

  <description>Julie Preston worked hard raising her younger sister Emily after their parents died, and creating a career. She gave up simple pleasures like love and relationships. So when a friend drags her to a singles bar, Julie’s ready for anything. She meets a gorgeous guy and they spend several passionate hours together. There’s real chemistry there, but Julie regretfully sticks to her promise: a one-night stand, no strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Julie hires a tutor to help Emily pass English, she’s shocked to find he’s the man from the bar. Seeing him in her house makes it hard to keep her hands off him, but he isn’t looking for a long-term relationship since he’s a singles bar patron. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many miles can Julie jog before she gives in and jumps him?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eve Dallas tracks a couple whose passion is fueled by cold brutality in the newest crime thriller from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Obsession in Death&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Festive in Death&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lieutenant Eve Dallas examines a body in a downtown Manhattan alleyway, the victim’s injuries are so extensive that she almost misses the clue. Carved into the skin is the shape of a heart—and initials inside reading &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella-Loo and her boyfriend, Darryl, had been separated while Darryl was a guest of the state of Oklahoma, and now that his sentence has been served they don’t ever intend to part again. Ella-Loo’s got dreams. And Darryl believes there are better ways to achieve your dreams than working for them. So they hit the road, and when their car breaks down in Arkansas, they make plans to take someone else’s. Then things get messy and they wind up killing someone—an experience that stokes a fierce, wild desire in Ella-Loo. A desire for Darryl. And a desire to kill again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they cross state lines on their way to New York to find the life they think they deserve, they will leave a trail of evil behind them. But now they’ve landed in the jurisdiction of Lieutenant Dallas and her team at the New York Police and Security Department. And with her husband, Roarke, at her side, she has every intention of hunting them down and giving them what they truly deserve . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Something big is brewing in Trenton, N.J., and it could blow at any minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie Plum might not be the world's greatest bounty hunter, but she knows when she's being played. Ken Globovic (aka Gobbles), hailed as the Supreme Exalted Zookeeper of the animal house known as Zeta fraternity, has been arrested for beating up the dean of students at Kiltman College. Gobbles has missed his court date and gone into hiding. People have seen him on campus, but no one will talk. Things just aren't adding up, and Stephanie can't shake the feeling that something funny is going on at the college - and it's not just Zeta fraternity pranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as people love Gobbles, they hate Doug Linken. When Linken is gunned down in his backyard it's good riddance, and the list of possible murder suspects is long. The only people who care about finding Linken's killer are Trenton cop Joe Morelli, who has been assigned the case, security expert Ranger, who was hired to protect Linken, and Stephanie, who has her eye on a cash prize and hopefully has some tricks up her sleeve.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She's about to go vigilante on his ass...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laney Briggs was almost certain that her sexy-assed Texas Ranger, Gunner Wilson, was gonna pop the question. Instead, he went and pulled one helluva fast one—he arrested her best friend, Luke Wagner, and skipped out. Now Pistol Rock's firecracker deputy is ready to go Wild West on Gunner…if she can just keep that raw, sexual chemistry under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner was planning to propose, and it all went to hell. Now he's boots-deep into an investigation with ties to the Dirty Southern Mafia and corrupt cops. Yep, Laney is definitely gonna have his hide. Especially when she finds out just how much he's been keeping from her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Laney has a weakness for Gunner's delectable cowboy hotness. And for him, she will break every rule in the book—including the ones she's sworn to uphold.</description>

  <description>Sometimes, to come clean, you've got to get your hands dirty ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Pretty, a self-confessed neat freak, has found the job she was born to do: a professional organizer, de-cluttering people's homes and workplaces. Her new business gets off to a cracking start when she lands her first client, health and fitness guru Natalia Samphire, in the well-heeled suburb of Astonvale. But things get messy at Natalia's mansion when Celeste finds a blackmail note and other mysterious items. And then there's Lenny Muscat, the sexy builder renovating the place, whose constant presence is muddling Celeste's usually organized brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When things get decidedly suspicious at the mansion, she and Lenny have to team up to investigate. But will Celeste emerge with her heart and professional reputation unscathed?</description>

Now she’s more likely to be getting down and dirty mucking out the pigs – and avoiding those of the human male variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ben Retallick walks out of her childhood and back into her present it seems that perhaps Pippa has more time than she thought. All Poldark smoulders and easy-going charm, Ben’s definitely worth whipping her wellies off for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ben is a man with his own past and his own issues – and as much as she’s enjoying having him around, she’s got to get a grip. After all life isn’t always a beach … even if you are in Cornwall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on the gorgeous Cornish coast at the height of summer, this is the perfect romance to take on your hols!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie is the author of Cold Feet at Christmas, the #1 Christmas bestseller!</description>

  <description>There are those who walk among us who are no longer alive, but not yet crossed over. They seek retribution…vengeance…to warn. Among the living, few intuit their presence.&lt;p&gt;Katie O'Hara is one who can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she’s drawn deeper and deeper into a gruesome years-old murder, whispered warnings from a spectral friend become more and more insistent. But Katie must uncover the truth: could David Beckett really be guilty of his fiancée’s murder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse – the body count’s rising on the Island of Bones, and the dead seem to be reenacting some macabre tableaux from history. The danger is increasing by the moment – especially as Katie finds herself irresistibly drawn to David, who may be responsible for more than just one killing….&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For Nina Askew, turning forty means freedom--from the ex-husband, freedom from their stuffy suburban home, freedom to focus on what she wants for a change. And what she wants is something her ex always vetoed--a puppy. A bouncy, adorable puppy. Instead she gets...Fred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overweight, middle-aged, a bit smelly and obviously depressed, Fred is light-years from perky. But he does manage to put Nina in the path of Alex Moore, her gorgeous, younger-by-a-decade neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex seems perfect--he's a sexy, seemingly sane, surprisingly single E.R. doctor--but the age gap convinces Nina that anyone but Alex would be better relationship material. But with every silver-haired stiff she dates, the more she suspects it's the young, dog-loving doc she wants to sit and stay!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; columnist Alexandra Petri turns her satirical eye on her own life in this hilarious new memoir...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most twentysomethings spend a lot of time avoiding awkwardness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Alexandra Petri.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afraid of rejection? Alexandra Petri has auditioned for &lt;i&gt;America’s Next Top Model&lt;/i&gt;. Afraid of looking like an idiot? Alexandra Petri lost &lt;i&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/i&gt; by answering “Who is that dude?” on national TV. Afraid of bad jokes? Alexandra Petri won an international pun championship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petri has been a debutante, reenacted the Civil War, and fended off suitors at a &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; convention while wearing a Jabba the Hutt suit. One time, she let some cult members she met on the street baptize her, just to be polite. She’s a connoisseur of the kind of awkwardness that most people spend whole lifetimes trying to avoid. If John Hodgman and Amy Sedaris had a baby…they would never let Petri babysit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Petri is here to tell you: Everything you fear is not so bad. Trust her. She’s tried it. And in the course of her misadventures, she’s learned that there are worse things out there than awkwardness—and that interesting things start to happen when you stop caring what people think.</description>

  <description>A Humorous Murder Mystery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A murder and a theft have been committed at Rudhall Manor. A box of jewels has vanished and Lord Sedley, a lusty old aristocrat, has been stabbed six times in the chest. &lt;br /&gt;It is all very mysterious, and the Sedley family and the servants have decided that Miss Lucy Anne Trotter, a recently employed governess, is to blame for the unfortunate events. &lt;br /&gt;The legendary and wickedly handsome Marquis, Lord William Adair, learns of the matter and decides to uncover the truth. &lt;br /&gt;Lucy, however, has little faith in blue blooded creatures—even if they possess dashing good looks— and, accompanied by two naughty pugs and a moody raven, decides to investigate and unmask the killer herself. &lt;br /&gt;But the hunt for the killer turns out to be far more complicated than she anticipates—what with snooty servants, warts in odd places, mixed up love affairs, agitated chickens and dreadful disguises ruining her plans. &lt;br /&gt;Soon she begins to wonder if, for once, she is in over her head…. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Though quite silly, I found <i>Murder At Rudhall Manor</i> to be a good and entertaining story. There’s a murderer on the loose at Rudhall Manor but it’s nearly impossible to take any of it seriously with the over the top goings on.

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Whirling from a life that's crumbling around her, Jennifer Carpenter devotes herself to the one thing she can control: becoming the ideal version of herself—a thinner version—no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She isn't always nice. She isn't always likable, but she's honest.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skinny Me&lt;/i&gt; is an in-depth look at the complicated layers of insecurity and depression that can stem from seeking self-worth and beauty in the numbers on a scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novel is beautiful, harsh, and truthful in its characterization of a woman who is flawed, yet inspirational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download &lt;i&gt;Skinny Me&lt;/i&gt; and join Jennifer on her journey toward self-discovery today!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Confronting, amusing and compelling, this is a story about choices and how they shape who we become.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paediatrician Mia Sandhurst and teenager, Rachel Hooper come together as doctor and patient, both hostages to people they love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia comes to terms with her husband's cheating, while Rachel is deliberately shielding someone who deserves to be named and shamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Hooper has his suspicions about his sister's persistent silence and, together with Mia's clinical know-how, sets out to uncover the truth, but the truth is more complex than either of them might have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on the coast of the magical Fleurieu Peninsula, &lt;i&gt;What Matters Most&lt;/i&gt; is a frank portrayal of self-discovery in middle age coupled with an unvarnished depiction of the mysteries of child abuse.</description>

  <description>Abigail Nichols has tried everything from rash-inducing herbal creams to acupuncture in a desperate, last-ditch effort to get pregnant. Wedged into her iPhone schedule among new business pitches and rebranding design meetings is Abby’s ovulation cycle, along with potential opportunities for illicit afternoon quickies. With all of their hopes and savings on the table, Abby and her husband Jack enter the whispered world of fertility clinics. Along with a meddling mother-in-law, competitive pregnancies, and constant obligatory sex, Abby’s baby-track mind conspires to ravage her career, her marriage, and her sanity. One thing she knows for sure: a healthy sense of humor (and the occasional glass of red wine) is the best coping strategy. One thing she wishes she knew: whether it will be enough. Ms. Conception is an honest but light-hearted novel inspired by the ups and downs of fertility treatments and the emotional burden that rests on those trying to conceive.</description>

  <description>Where Confidence is the New Black. &lt;br /&gt; Meet best friends Pixie, Ellie, Katie and Jane. Fed up with always struggling to lose weight, they ditch the scales and start a social club where size doesn't matter. Soon it's the most popular place to be - having fun instead of counting calories - and the women find their lives changing in ways they never imagined. &lt;br /&gt; But the club can't stop real life from mucking things up. &lt;br /&gt; Sharing offices in a taxidermist's garage with Pete the bear, together they've got to manage more than their new club - dodgy colleagues, a waste-of-space husband and sabotaged romance - while learning the most important lesson of all. In the Curvy Girls Club, confidence is the new black. &lt;br /&gt; "This is a delightful book of friendship, acceptance, and belonging for anyone who has ever wondered: "What if?""

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Haven't you ever told a little lie in the name of love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vivia Grant couldn’t be happier. She has her dream job and is about to marry her dream man. Does it really matter that she’s led him to believe she’s a virgin? After all, being in love makes every experience feel like the first time anyway! But an unexpected encounter with an ex-lover is about to expose her embarrassing lie…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Vivia’s fiancé discovers the truth, he ends their engagement—via text—and uses his connections to get her fired. Unemployed and heartbroken, Vivia begins planning her new future—as a homeless spinster. But her best friend has a better idea. They’ll skip the Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s binge and go on Vivia’s honeymoon instead. Two weeks cycling through Provence and Tuscany, with Luc de Caumont, a sexy French bike guide. Too bad Vivia’s not a big fan of biking. And she’s abysmal at languages. Will she fib her way through the adventure, or finally learn to love herself—and Luc—flaws and all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There's a thin line between hero worship and dangerous obsession...the explosive new Eve Dallas and Roarke thriller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crisp winter morning in New York. In a luxury apartment, the body of a woman lies stretched out on a huge bed. On the wall above, the killer has left a message in bold black ink: FOR LIEUTENANT EVE DALLAS, WITH GREAT ADMIRATION AND UNDERSTANDING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve Dallas is used to unwanted attention. Famous for her high-profile cases and her marriage to billionaire businessman Roarke, she has learned to deal with intense public scrutiny and media gossip. But now Eve has become the object of a singular and deadly obsession. She has an 'admirer', who just can't stop thinking about her. Who is convinced they have a special bond. Who is planning to kill for her - again and again...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With time against her, Eve is forced to play a delicate - and dangerous - psychological dance. Because the killer is desperate for something Eve can never provide - approval. And once that becomes clear, Eve knows her own life will be at risk - along with those she cares about the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her father relents and allows her to venture outside the tower, but only if she is accompanied by the royal entourage comprising of guards, doctors, nurses, maids, a cook, an elephant, as well as a military tank complete with a powerful cannon.&lt;br /&gt;Just when she thinks she is beginning to understand the world outside the tower, she sees him moving amongst the crowd, and her entire world tilts on its axis and the tale takes an unexpected turn....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tami Hoag brings back her fan-favorite Minneapolis investigators Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska in the haunting new thriller &lt;i&gt;The 9th Girl&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Kovac had seen more dead bodies than he could count: Men, women, children; victims of shootings, stabbings, strangulations, beatings; fresh corpses and bodies that had been left for days in the trunks of cars in the dead of summer. But he had never seen anything quite like this . . . "&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a frigid New Year's Eve in Minneapolis a young woman's brutalized body falls from the trunk of a car into the path of oncoming traffic. Questions as to whether she was alive or dead when she hit the icy pavement result in her macabre nickname, Zombie Doe. Unidentified and unidentifiable, she is the ninth nameless female victim of the year, and homicide detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska are charged with the task of not only finding out who Zombie Doe is, but who in her life hated her enough to destroy her. Was it personal, or could it just have been a crime of opportunity? Their greatest fear is that not only is she their ninth Jane Doe of the year, but that she may be the ninth victim of a vicious transient serial killer they have come to call Doc Holiday.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Crisscrossing America's heartland, Doc Holiday chooses his victims at random, snatching them in one city and leaving them in another, always on a holiday. If Zombie Doe is one of his, he has brought his gruesome game to a new and more terrifying level. But as Kovac and Liska begin to uncover the truth, they will find that the monsters in their ninth girl's life may have lived closer to home. And even as another young woman disappears, they have to ask the question: which is the greater evil--the devil you know or the devil you don't?&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska return to investigate the death of a Jane Doe in New York Times bestseller Tami Hoag’s short story The 1st Victim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Year’s Day is a time for new beginnings, but Minneapolis homicide detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska are focused on endings: specifically, the tragic end of their latest murder victim, an unidentified young woman discovered on the side of the freeway. Believed to be the victim of a serial killer, Kovac and Liska are determined to do the girl the small justice of returning her body to her family as they investigate her case, but it is no simple task matching the broken corpse to any of the scores of missing persons reports, especially when no one seems to be looking for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, recent widow Jeannie Reiser is frantic when she is unable to get in touch with her daughter, Rose, who, as an eighteen-year-old, is a legal adult rather than a missing child in the eyes of the law. Jeannie’s desperate attempts to get the police to believe her child is in trouble lead her closer and closer to the New Year’s Doe and to an evil even Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska may be unable to stop. Tami Hoag once again proves her place as “one of the most intense suspense writers around”* with The 1st Victim. Includes an early look at The 9th Girl, coming July 2013.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00QOSK4QW&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose West is about to play the most important, breakthrough gig of her life, when Rex Byron swans into the club and steals the spotlight, with a flurry of fans and flashing lights. It was hate at first sight. Rex is the British heir to his father’s multimillion dollar art fortune and is known for getting into trouble around the world, particularly with no clothes on. Rose’s mesmerizing singing voice catches the eye of the playful and aggravatingly persistent heir, and he is determined to teach her the fine art of flirting, but she is not interested in being involved in his next American scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there more to Rex than what meets the eye? Is he an arrogant, pompous twit or a sensitive soul with a troubled past? More importantly, will Rose even give him the time of day? This is another romantic comedy filled with flirting and fun by Sophie Sloane.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00QOSJZJO&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the wedding day for Poppy Shillington, a young, American woman. Everything is perfect: the white dress, the veil, the orchestra, except for one thing. Who is the groom? She stares into the mirror in her dressing room, and reminisces about her relationships with the three men she dated in her twenties: Dax, Mike, and Simon. A good-looking guy with bad manners, a straight-forward sensitive soul, and an adoring intellectual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She remembers the passionately devastating trip to Paris, her humiliating adventures in the Great Outdoors, and a traumatizing game of Scrabble with the in-laws. As she shares the embarrassing, funny, and romantic stories of each man, it becomes increasingly challenging to predict which man she will end up with. This is another romantic comedy filled with flirting and fun by Sophie Sloane.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kimmy Jones has three loves: cupcakes, gossip magazines and dreaming of getting fit just by owning celeb workouts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kimmy's Sensible Boyfriend told her he didn't approve of her longing for the high life or her dream of starting a cupcake company Kimmy thought she could compromise – after all, she did return those five-inch Paris Hilton heels! But asking her to trade in cake-making for a job sorting potatoes is a step too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, newly single - and newly homeless – Kimmy needs a dusting of Christmas luck. And, masquerading as a professional house sitter, her new temporary home is the stunning Mistletoe Mansion. Soon she’s best buds with glamorous next door golf WAG Melissa, and orders are pouring in for her fabulous Merry Berry cupcakes! The only thorn in her side is handsome handyman Luke, a distraction she definitely doesn't need. And talking of distractions, something very odd is going on at night…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimmy is finally living the life she’s always wanted. But will her glimpse into the glittering lifestyle of the rich and famous be as glamorous as she’s always imagined?</description>

  <description>Lexi Anderson is an up-and-coming, Martha Stewart-type TV hostess whose two kids love the Jared Strong adventure novels, which happen to be written by their new neighbor, Kyle Miller.&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his writing career, Kyle has writer's block - until he sees the snowman on his lawn and realizes this is the &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; place for his villain to hide the weapon. He digs into the snowman to discover two things: the weapon fits into the body just under the head, and the snowman was supposed to be the back drop for Lexi's next show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this improbable beginning comes friendship. Can there be more for a woman who is afraid to get close again and a man who has shadows from his childhood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families join together and hearts are healed as this couple goes walking in a winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed this charming Christmas story that brings two people together for the holiday. I enjoyed how Lexi and Kyle meet and at first glance, I wondered if they would get along.

  <description>Like all cubical-bound underlings at Stranton Advertising, Lissy Swanson is desperate to become a Creative. Her impossibly chic superiors enjoy liquid lunches at hip restaurants where intricate bits of sushi are served on bare midsections of androgynous models while she buries herself in dreaded data entry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her dreams of Creativedom are finally realized, Lissy is thrilled to work on her first real account - a new drug that scorches fat, bronzes skin and fires up dormant libidos: the Barbie Pill. She plans the perfect campaign, targeting new mothers dying to shed baby weight and rekindle their more adult desires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lissy discovers the beauty pill's ugly secret, she must choose between a promising new love interest and succeeding in the glossy world of Los Angeles advertising.</description>

  <description>Clementine, a psychologist specialising in couples counselling, is reeling from the discovery that her boyfriend is married. Annabel, an ex-model, only seems to attract men who want her as a trophy. Daniela, a civil engineer, is stuck in the friendzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoning the romantic notions of true love that haven't worked out for them, the three decide to use their considerable professional skills to find a partner. This isn't about hearts and flowers; it's about being practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm and witty, &lt;i&gt;Husband Hunters&lt;/i&gt; is about what happens when you try to engineer love.</description>

  <description>When her best friends offer the use of their cottage in the beautiful French countryside, Evie jumps at the chance. With her soon-to-be-ex-husband, celebrity chef Will Brooke, plastered over the news with his latest ‘love interest’, leaving the country seems like the perfect plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with her French grandmother’s tattered notebook of recipes, Evie is determined to ignore Christmas altogether and bake herself back to happiness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when Evie meets her next-door neighbour – the très gorgeous doctor Didier she finds a very willing taste-tester. But is it possible that he could be interested in more than just her Tarte Tatin? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With snow falling, a special Réveillon dinner and a little Christmas magic in the air, could Didier even be the one to thaw Evie’s heart? Or will a visit from the ghost of Christmas past change everything?</description>

  <description>Difficult Husbands - In sickness and in health, for better but definitely not for worse…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly divorced Lorna is struggling to adjust to life on her own. When she discovers that her beloved godfather has left her the grand (and crumbling) Ravenscourt House in the heart of Sussex, she soon has a project on her hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan sells delicious goodies at Mulberry Farm. When he meets Lorna at a Christmas market, neither of them can ignore the chemistry. But as they get to know one another, Lorna wants to know one thing – is he after her or the house?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with Gloria – whose marriage to alcoholic Adrian has hit rock bottom, and Rosalind – struggling to deal with her womanising husband Ivan, the three friends hatch a plan. They’ll ditch their difficult husbands at Ravenscourt House and enjoy stress-free Christmases with their families. But nothing is ever that simple…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary de Laszlo has had four novels published by Headline and has since had many others published by Hale. She lives in London and is an active member of the RNA. She was a fashion journalist with Vogue and now works as an occasional film extra when not writing.</description>

  <description>Grace and Ted Chapman are widely regarded as the perfect literary power couple. Ted is a successful novelist and Grace, his wife of twenty years, is beautiful, stylish, carefree, and a wonderful homemaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what no one sees, what is churning under the surface, is Ted’s rages. His mood swings. And the precarious house of cards that their lifestyle is built upon. When Ted’s longtime assistant and mainstay leaves, the house of cards begins to crumble and Grace, with dark secrets in her past, is most vulnerable. She finds herself in need of help but with no one to turn to…until the perfect new assistant shows up out of the blue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the rescue comes Beth, a competent young woman who can handle Ted and has the calm efficiency to weather the storms that threaten to engulf the Chapman household. Soon, though, it’s clear to Grace that Beth might be too good to be true. This new interloper might be the biggest threat of all, one that could cost Grace her marriage, her reputation, and even her sanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything at stake and no one to confide in, Grace must find a way to save herself before it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Powerful and riveting, &lt;b&gt;Jane Green's Saving Grace&lt;/b&gt; will have you on the edge of your seat as you follow Grace on her harrowing journey to rock bottom and back.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Landon Brinkley is making her dreams come true. After years of poring over glossy photos of celebrity parties in People and US Weekly, she’s landed her Holy Grail: an internship with the fabulous Selah Smith, event planner to the Hollywood elite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving from small town Texas to Los Angeles, Landon finds herself in a world in which spending a million dollars on an event – even for kids’ birthdays – is de rigueur. The thrill of working on A-list parties and celeb weddings is enough to get her through the 75-hour workweeks, the nightmare of a multi-day film festival, and abuse at the hands of a mercurial boss. LA is full of opportunity for fame, fortune and even love. But confronted with the seamy realities of the business, she is forced to make a choice: do whatever it takes to get ahead, or stay true to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A roman a clef in the vein of The Devil Wears Prada, PARTY GIRL draws on the author’s real life experience for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the celebrity-obsessed world of event planning. From the party habits of America’s favorite underage singer to the worst Bridezilla of all (the kind that graces the cover of your favorite magazine), PARTY GIRL reveals the ugly side of Hollywood’s prettiest parties.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Divorce Diet&lt;/i&gt; is a novel that should be dedicated to every woman who ever walked away from a man or a diet. It's bitingly funny and insightful, while celebrating food and self-discovery just don't read it while you're hungry. It's perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Julie and Julia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abigail loves her baby Rosie, her husband Thad, and food. She takes great joy and comfort in concocting culinary delights to show the depth of her love and commitment to her family. Imagine her surprise when Thad announces, this whole marriage thing just doesn't work for me. Abigail can't believe he really means what he's said, but he does. Abigail and Rosie move back in to her parents' house, where she regresses into her adolescent self. She diets, finds work, and begins to discover the life she really wants, and a man who really wants her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sophie has no interest in finding love. But what happens when love finds her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Wells is a successful photographer with a focus on putting the past firmly behind her.

He also can't understand how he's been duped into employing Sophie's impulsive friend Tula, whose crush on him is decidedly unrequited. Both girls remain mum about the reasons behind Sophie's indifference to love. But that doesn't mean Josh is going to quit trying...</description>

  <description>What if you could do it all over again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Wright is pretty sure her husband doesn't love her anymore. She and Max used to be the perfect couple, but the pressures of work and kids have pulled them in opposite directions. Now, Jen is full of "what if" questions about whether her bland, suburban existence is all she was ever destined for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a terrible accident sends Jen into a coma, she is able to see what her life could have been if she had run off to Australia with the handsome, dangerous man she met on vacation, or if she had stayed with her workaholic college boyfriend. Would she ever have loved another child as much as she loves her daughters? Could she have become rich? More than anything, Jen wants to do the right thing for her family. But what she discovers may leave her with even more questions about the choices she made, and no easy answers about what to do next.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of Ruthie Knox, Rachel Gibson, and Molly O’Keefe will love this deeply romantic and uplifting debut novel about losing everything you thought you wanted—and getting exactly what you need.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sophie Richards has been looking forward to a much-needed girls’ night out: a Rolling Stones tribute-band concert, a few drinks, a distraction from her grueling nursing shifts in acute care. But when her best friend bails, Sophie gets stuck with a blind date.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although Brett Nicholson may be the hottest carpenter alive, and Sophie may technically be single, she isn’t exactly on the market. Six years ago she found The One. He was everything Sophie dreamed a man could be—and then she lost him. In an instant, her whole life changed, and she forgot all about happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as she gets to know Brett, Sophie starts to wonder about the future for the first time. With a broken heart still clouding her mind, jumping into a new relationship feels impossible. When she’s in his arms, walking away feels even harder. Now Sophie faces an impossible choice: living in the past or choosing love in the here and now.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Can’t Always Get What You Want&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Can’t Always Get What You Want is heart-wrenching in all the right ways. Smartly written and emotionally satisfying, this story will stick with you long after the last page.”—&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A sweet, moving story about love and loss, Chelsey Krause’s debut is full of heart.”—&lt;b&gt;Clodagh Murphy, author of &lt;i&gt;Girl in a Spin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Can’t Always Get What You Want is a delightful mix of humor, heart, and the struggle to move on from past grief. I am definitely looking forward to more books by Chelsey Krause!”—&lt;b&gt;Mary Frame, author of &lt;i&gt;Imperfect Chemistry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a funny, heartfelt story about moving on, a touching debut from a very promising author. Romance lovers looking for both a giggle and a cry will get what they need from Can’t Always Get What You Want.”—&lt;b&gt;Stephanie Pegler, editor, &lt;i&gt;Chicklit Club&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Very romantic . . . I loved this book mainly for Sophie trying to figure out that everyone deserves a second chance at feeling loved again. . . . [I] can’t wait for more from Chelsey Krause.”—&lt;b&gt;Reviews by Melena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>With Christmas just around the corner, the residents of Skipley village are gearing up for the annual bake off, and tensions are high. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning means a lot to everyone involved - talented cake-shop owner Katie dreams of baking stardom, Rachel wants to prove she's more than a stay-at-home mum, and John hopes his culinary skills will impress the woman he loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the judges discover that some cakes have been tampered with, the villagers' loyalties are called into question - whose ambition would stretch to sabotage, and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christmas Bake-Off is an exclusive short story from Abby Clements, author of Meet Me Under the Mistletoe. This ebook edition also includes bonus recipes for cinnamon cookies and vanilla and almond biscuits.</description>

  <description>Almost a decade has passed since Andy Sachs quit the job “a million girls would die for” working for Miranda Priestly at Runway magazine—a dream that turned out to be a nightmare. Andy and Emily, her former nemesis and co-assistant, have since joined forces to start a high end bridal magazine, The Plunge, which has quickly become required reading for the young and stylish. Now they get to call all the shots: Andy writes and travels to her heart’s content; Emily plans parties and secures advertising like a seasoned pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, Andy has met the love of her life. Max Harrison, scion of a storied media family, is confident, successful, and drop-dead gorgeous. Their wedding will be splashed across all the society pages as their friends and family gather to toast the glowing couple. Andy Sachs is on top of the world. But karma’s a bitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning of her wedding, Andy can’t shake the past. And when she discovers a secret letter with crushing implications, her wedding-day jitters turn to cold dread. Andy realizes that nothing—not her husband, nor her beloved career—is as it seems. She never suspected that her efforts to build a bright new life would lead her back to the darkness she barely escaped ten years ago—and directly into the path of the devil herself...</description>

  <description>They fell in love in an instant … so why have they spent a lifetime apart? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager Kellie dated an American boy but circumstances meant they went their separate ways. Now he’s back and she’s so tempted to see him again. But two decades have passed and they are both married with children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the last thing a celebrity reporter like her needs is the world finding out about her past relationship with a rock star. Especially as Kellie’s husband doesn’t even know she once dated AJ Dangerfield, lead singer of legendary band Danger Game. And she has no intention of him finding out. EVER. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kellie deals with a demanding boss, a bullied son, an infuriating mother-in-law and a best friend who won’t act her age, she finds herself playing a dangerous game. What will happen if her two worlds collide? And is it possible that first love never fades?</description>

  <description>As Little Missington's first Christmas baby in fifty years and the daughter of 'Christmas When You Like It' party-planners, Holly West has been surrounded by the holiday spirit since birth. Trouble is, she's not exactly filled with festive cheer. In fact, Holly can't wait to ditch the tinsel and Santa suits for champagne and celebs, and become a party-planner to the stars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When British film star Dean Layton hires her parents' company to throw his holiday bash in Manhattan, Holly jumps at the chance to help, confident she can handle a little Christmas in exchange for access to Dean's exclusive world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But New York and Dean's over-the-top demands are more than Holly bargained for. Can Holly deck the halls and make it a party to be proud of, or will this Christmas be one she'll never forget . . . even if she wants to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Mistletoe in Manhattan is a novella.</description>

  <description>After losing her job and her boyfriend on the same day, Lara's beginning to wonder if her life can possibly get any worse. Then along comes Jamie, a childhood friend, offering her a job delivering mysterious packages to random destinations around the world and suddenly, things are looking up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lara packs her bags and sets off on an epic adventure, meeting billionaire Arabic Princes, rugged cowboys, a sparkling wannabe vampire, a love guru with sex on the brain and Angelina Jolie's bodyguards along the way. But though trouble always seems to find Lara, it seems love is rather more elusive.</description>

  <description>Meet Britain's Worst Innkeeper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mother and extremely undomestic goddess, Lottie, has five days to become the ultimate B&amp;amp;B hostess to save her beloved Aunt Kate’s livelihood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Aunt Kate ends up in the hospital, Lottie and her seven-year-old daughter are called to rural Wales to stand in at the B&amp;amp;B. Without the faintest idea how to run a hotel (she can barely run her own life), Lottie must impress the picky hotel reviewer and his dysfunctional family who are coming to stay over Christmas. Without the rating only he can bestow, Aunt Kate will lose her livelihood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will Danny, the local taxi driver who she hires to help her, really be Santa’s little helper, or the Grinch who stole Christmas?</description>

  <description>For Tamsin Angel, Christmas is always the biggest and best… chic parties and a little showbiz sparkle are a must. This year though, things aren’t going quite as planned… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With bailiffs suddenly at the door and her husband nowhere to be found, it looks like Christmas just got downsized. Moving into her sister’s one-bedroom flat, she wonders whether things will ever be the same again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her husband on Christmas Eve, Sam Angel has rebuilt her life around her son Jacob and her new business – The White Angel Bakery. She’s also found herself a very handsome, loving boyfriend, but is struggling to let go of the past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together with a sprinkle of Christmas magic, Sam and Tamsin might just learn a little more about each other – and themselves. But when disaster strikes at the bakery, will they be able to save the day in time for Christmas?</description>

  <description>A man out of time. A woman out of options. Natchez detective Mike Faricy will do anything to undo his brother-in-law's murder. A man named Slick offers him a deal he can't refuse-go back to June 19th, the day before the killing. Mike strikes the Bargain and wakes up on June 19th gazing down the barrel of an antique gun held by Abigail Kingsley, who confirms it is June 19th, but the year is 1865. Now Mike must prevent the murder from over a century in the past, while being taunted by a shape-shifting Slick. The devil may own his soul, but it's Abigail who stakes a powerful claim on his aching heart. Will her darkest secrets be his ultimate undoing...? "Dirty Harry" meets "Scarlett O'Hara" and there's Hell to pay....</description>

  <description>For the past thirty-three years, Angela Gillespie has sent to friends and family around the world an end-of-the-year letter titled “Hello from the Gillespies.” It’s always been cheery and full of good news. This year, Angela surprises herself—she tells the truth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillespies are far from the perfect family that Angela has made them out to be. Her husband is coping badly with retirement. Her thirty-two-year-old twins are having career meltdowns. Her third daughter, badly in debt, can’t stop crying. And her ten-year-old son spends more time talking to his imaginary friend than to real ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without Angela, the family would fall apart. But when a bump on the head leaves Angela with temporary amnesia, the Gillespies pull together—and pull themselves together—in wonderfully surprising ways....</description>

  <description>Cinderella meets Falling Down in this wickedly funny tale about having it all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol is perfect… at least that’s what everyone thinks. In reality she’s sinking fast – her family treats her like their personal assistant and her boyfriend is so busy with work that he’s got her single-handedly running their relationship. Not that her job is any easier. As the only woman on the bank’s trading floor she spends twelve-hour days trying not to get sworn at or felt up by colleagues who put the "W" in banker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can she go on pleasing everyone else before she snaps and loses it all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor and empathy, Perfect Girl lays bare the balancing act that working women face in a man's world</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Readers of Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, and Sabrina Jeffries will love Ashlyn Macnamara’s novel about a smoldering new love that is threatened by past betrayals.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Viscount Lindenhurst cannot seem to find a governess who meets his impossible standards—until Cecelia Sanford becomes the first woman to interrupt the widower’s brooding in years. Lind had returned home from the Napoleonic wars, broken in body and soul and longing for his wife’s embrace, only to find her changed. Before they could reconcile, an accident struck their son and claimed her life. Now enter Cecelia, with her soft curves and sharp tongue—a tempting distraction, it is true, but not a welcome one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Past the usual marrying age and haunted by a scandal of her own, Cecelia soon finds herself caring for both the child and the man. The viscount is brittle and even abrupt at times, yet she cannot deny the attraction that stirs her body in his presence. Moved by the deep sense of abandonment that tortures his soul, Cecelia aches to fully awaken Lind’s heart from its rancorous slumber—if she can just keep their pasts from destroying a second chance at love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Falling in love is just not on Nora King’s To Do List…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither is accidentally super-gluing her shoe to her hand right before the biggest presentation of her life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the hard work she’d put into securing the family business after her father’s death, Nora has no choice but to accept help from a knight in shining armour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disaster relief worker Ethan Love is still haunted by his last deployment, and desperate for distraction. He’s in town to ask Nora for a major favour, and swooping in to save her presentation is a sure way to get her on side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ethan sticks around and helps Nora through her grief, her barriers tumble down…but will she dare to swap her To Do lists for a How to Fall in Love list?</description>

  <description>Meet Zoe and Greg Milton, a married couple who have let themselves go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe was a stunner in her high school days, but the intervening decades have added seventy pounds, and removed most of her self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg's rugby-playing days are well and truly behind him, thanks to countless beers and fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elise, a radio DJ and Zoe's best friend, tells them about a new competition, it seems like the perfect opportunity to turn their lives around. Fat Chance will pit six hefty couples against one another to see who can collectively lose the most weight and walk away with a large cash prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins six months of abject misery, tears, and frustration—that just might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to them—in another laugh-out-loud look at the way we live now from bestselling author Nick Spalding.</description>

  <description>Meet America’s Tweet-Heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s network reporter Cassidy Shea, better known as @TwitterGirl, with more than a million followers thanks to her sarcastic tweets. One hundred forty characters that can take anyone down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while brevity may be the soul of wit, it can also get you fired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a controversial tweet goes viral the snarky redhead finds herself locked out of the career she loves… and watches her boyfriend take a hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, no industry values sarcasm more than politics, and Cassidy becomes a marketable commodity for Presidential candidate Will Becker, a squeaky-clean, stone cold lock to be the next occupant of the White House. This candidate is unlike any other; he’s the country’s most eligible bachelor. He’s also looking for a running mate, and we’re not talking about a Vice President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twitter Girl has caught his eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassidy finds herself swept up in a whirlwind romance that turns her into the next Jackie Kennedy and becomes the favorite to be the next First Lady. The country can’t get enough of America’s First Couple… will Cassidy and Will Becker bring back Camelot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But an anonymous tip triggers her journalistic curiosity. Is Will Becker all that he seems? The search for the answer teaches Cassidy the meaning of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - See more at: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.harperimpulseromance.com/books/twitter-girl#sthash.p7t9V1Wm.dpuf" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.harperimpulseromance.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.harperimpulseromance.com/books/twitter-girl#sthash.p7t9V1Wm.dpuf" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.harperimpulseromance.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone loves Christmas – &lt;i&gt;don’t they&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carrie Blake&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; her job as a nanny but, while her friends are settling down, all of Carrie’s spare time is spent with other people’s families. Though it breaks her heart, her New Year’s resolution is to embark on a new career &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; fix her love life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Carrie starts her last job, she’s sure she’ll be going out on a high – the house is &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, the kids are adorable, and she’s in charge of decorating the tree! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem could be her boss… single-dad &lt;b&gt;Adam Fletcher&lt;/b&gt; might be both handsome and successful, but he’s &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; working. Doesn’t he realise he’s missing out on precious moments with his son and daughter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Adam’s family arrive for Christmas including his sensitive sister, Sharon, and his fun-loving elderly Grandpa, Walter, Carrie realises that she might just have found the perfect allies in her quest to persuade Adam to loosen up. There’s still time for Carrie to make this the best Christmas ever… after all, &lt;b&gt;Christmas is the time for miracles, &lt;i&gt;isn’t it?&lt;/i&gt; Let the festivities begin!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Verena Valent is at the helm of her family's legendary Swiss skincare company, which caters to a glamorous clientele in the heart of Beverly Hills. After her parents are killed in an automobile accident, she becomes the sole provider for her younger twin sisters and her grandmother. Instead of attending college with her friends as planned, she rises to the challenge to guide and expand her family's business. She is in the midst of a critical international expansion into Asia when her carefully organized life begins to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verena is shaken to discover that her fiancé, Derrick, might be behind a scheme to take over her growing company. While she struggles to save the business that means everything to her, she meets Lance, an executive chef at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She encounters this intriguing man again while on a business trip to Paris, and soon gains a new perspective on love, romance, and relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the unthinkable occurs and Verena's world collapses, her friends rally around her, among them Scarlett Sandoval, a top intellectual property attorney; Dahlia DuBois, a perfumer from an esteemed line of French perfumers; and Fianna Fitzgerald, a fashion designer with her own trendy boutique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, Verena learns that truth, family, friendship, and love are the unshakable pillars of life. But will she get a second chance in business, or in love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawless is the first book in the Love, California series. Follow a group of smart, stylish, entrepreneurial friends as they navigate the turbulences of modern life in the business of beauty. Set in Beverly Hills with action flung across the globe, this engaging series features gutsy, determined best friends, and how they manage to live the lives of their dreams.</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is the bane of her mother's existence. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper etiquette at tea--and god forbid anyone see her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. She enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But little do Sophronia or her mother know that this is a school where ingenious young girls learn to finish, all right--but it's a different kind of finishing. Mademoiselle Geraldine's certainly trains young ladies in the finer arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but also in the other kinds of finishing: the fine arts of death, diversion, deceit, espionage, and the modern weaponries. Sophronia and her friends are going to have a rousing first year at school.</description>

  <description>Just after Independence Day in July 1953 Violet Sullivan, a local good time girl living in Serena Station Southern California, drives off in her brand new Chevy and is never seen again. Left behind is her young daughter, Daisy, and Violet's impetuous husband, Foley, who had been persuaded to buy his errant wife the car only days before . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, thirty-five years later, Daisy wants closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reluctant to open such an old cold case Kinsey Millhone agrees to spend five days investigating, believing at first that Violet simply moved on to pastures new. But very soon it becomes clear that a lot of people shared a past with Violet, a past that some are still desperate to keep hidden. And in a town as close-knit as Serena there aren't many places to hide when things turn vicious . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Alice Hoffman, Sarah Addison Allen, and Adriana Trigiani, &lt;i&gt;The Dress Shop of Dreams&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating novel of enduring hopes, second chances, and the life-changing magic of true love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since her parents’ mysterious deaths many years ago, scientist Cora Sparks has spent her days in the safety of her university lab or at her grandmother Etta’s dress shop. Tucked away on a winding Cambridge street, Etta’s charming tiny store appears quite ordinary to passersby, but the colorfully vibrant racks of beaded silks, delicate laces, and jewel-toned velvets hold bewitching secrets: With just a few stitches from Etta’s needle, these gorgeous gowns have the power to free a woman’s deepest desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etta’s dearest wish is to work her magic on her granddaughter. Cora’s studious, unromantic eye has overlooked Walt, the shy bookseller who has been in love with her forever. Determined not to allow Cora to miss her chance at happiness, Etta sews a tiny stitch into Walt’s collar, hoping to give him the courage to confess his feelings to Cora. But magic spells—like true love—can go awry. After Walt is spurred into action, Etta realizes she’s set in motion a series of astonishing events that will transform Cora’s life in extraordinary and unexpected ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;The Dress Shop of Dreams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Bighearted, beautiful, and brushed with magic, this novel celebrates life’s moments of joy, possibility, and transformation. Menna van Praag’s writing is bright with sparkles and lovely grace notes.”&lt;b&gt;—Susan Wiggs, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Beekeeper’s Ball&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Look for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader’s Circle for author chats and more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens in the bedroom &lt;i&gt;doesn’t &lt;/i&gt;have to stay in the bedroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A refreshingly open and &lt;b&gt;uplifting romantic comedy about friendship, love and sex. &lt;/b&gt; Sometimes you need to step out of your comfort zone in order to give a relationship a good dose of TLC…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sex therapist Annie Hall helps couples put the fizz back into their relationships.&lt;/b&gt; It’s a shame her own love life is non-existent. When Jamie who works next door catches her eye, she can’t ignore the spark of chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most men would jump at the chance to skive off work for an afternoon quickie with their gorgeous wife, but Nick knows Julia is after only one thing – a baby. Sex shouldn’t be a chore. Can Annie help Julia see that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly engaged Zoe and Simon can’t keep their hands off each other. They’ve decided to take a vow of celibacy until their wedding night. Will Annie help them stick to it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy and Linda have been married for over thirty years but she’s more interested in the family business than getting intimate with him. Can Annie convince Linda to rediscover her passion for Roy after all this time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Annie begins to work her magic with the three couples, she soon discovers that she’ll need to take some of her own advice if she’s going to let a new man into her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re a fan of Tracy Bloom’s &lt;i&gt;No one Ever Has Sex on a Tuesday&lt;/i&gt; and Lindsey Kelk, kick your feet up, turn off your phone, and sink into Sophie’s novel.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Meet Ruby’s fiancé, Finn. He’s gorgeous, thoughtful, successful and adoring – pretty much everything anyone could ever want in a man. In fact, he’s perfect. The catch? He’s just not perfect for her. But when Ruby finally plucks up the courage to come clean, Finn’s so furious that he misses his footing as he runs down the stairs – and suddenly, it’s not just his heart that’s broken!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Finn wakes up, he can’t remember a thing. Not that Ruby dumped him – not even that they were ever engaged! It’s on the tip of Ruby’s tongue to come clean, but somehow, it never seems to be the right time... And as the weeks pass, she sees a new side to Finn. Arrogant and a shameless flirt, he’s irresistibly bad, and the chemistry between them is explosive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not that Ruby’s lying… she’s just withholding the truth. And seeing as things are going so well, perhaps there’s no need for Finn to have his memory jogged… The trouble is, there’s every chance that Finn might remember for himself!</description>

  <description>2015 HOLT Medallion Award of Merit Recipient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind every lost dream lies a second chance…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When adored town spinster Joy Talley ends up in a coma after a peculiar accident, she is surprised and incensed to hear what is being said in her hospital room, including plans for her funeral. When she finally wakes, her well-meaning, but bossy, brothers and sisters dismiss her claims, thinking her accident has knocked her off her rocker, but Joy has never felt better, and is determined to set the past right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Joy must face her darkest secret and risk reopening wounds caused by an old flame who rejected her more than twenty years ago. But taking risks brings change, as well as a new, younger man into Joy’s life, making her feel like a teenager again. Suddenly Joy’s once humdrum life is anything but boring and routine and the future beckons, exhilarating and bright.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Supernatural meets The Da Vinci Code in this action-packed paranormal thriller, the first book in a new series from New York Times bestselling author Kami Garcia. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never believed in ghosts. Until one tried to kill me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kennedy Waters finds her mother dead, her world begins to unravel. She doesn’t know that paranormal forces in a much darker world are the ones pulling the strings. Not until identical twins Jared and Lukas Lockhart break into Kennedy’s room and destroy a dangerous spirit sent to kill her. The brothers reveal that her mother was part of an ancient secret society responsible for protecting the world from a vengeful demon — a society whose five members were all murdered on the same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Kennedy has to take her mother’s place in the Legion if she wants to uncover the truth and stay alive. Along with new Legion members Priest and Alara, the teens race to find the only weapon that might be able to destroy the demon — battling the deadly spirits he controls every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspense, romance, and the paranormal meet in this chilling urban fantasy, the first book in a new series from Kami Garcia, bestselling coauthor of the Beautiful Creatures novels.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In this compelling and poignant debut novel, a woman skilled at caring for animals must learn to mend the broken relationships in her family.…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For veterinarian Geneva Novak, animals can be easier to understand than people. They’re also easier to forgive. But when her mother, Helen, is injured in a vodka-fueled accident, it’s up to Geneva to give her the care she needs.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Since her teens, Geneva has kept her self-destructive mother at arm’s length. Now, with two slippery teenagers of her own at home, the last thing she wants is to add Helen to the mix. But Geneva’s husband convinces her that letting Helen live with them could be her golden chance to repair their relationship.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Geneva isn’t expecting her mother to change anytime soon, but she may finally get answers to the questions she’s been asking for so long. As the truth about her family unfolds, however, Geneva may find secrets too painful to bear and too terrible to forgive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CONVERSATION GUIDE INCLUDED&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Personal trainer Trey Ziegler was in peak physical condition. If you didn’t count the kitchen knife in his well-toned chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Eve Dallas soon discovers a lineup of women who were loved and left by the narcissistic gym rat. While Dallas sorts through the list of Ziegler’s enemies, she’s also dealing with her Christmas shopping list—plus the guest list for her and her billionaire husband’s upcoming holiday bash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling less than festive, Dallas tries to put aside her distaste for the victim and solve the mystery of his death. There are just a few investigating days left before Christmas, and as New Year’s 2061 approaches, this homicide cop is resolved to stop a cold-blooded killer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Award-winning author Kat Bastion teams with her husband, Stone Bastion, in this first book in the No Weddings Series about Cade Michaelson, a successful man with his sights set on a new venture in business, and Hannah Martin, the woman who makes it personal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have my act together as a successful bar owner, my master’s degree within reach, and a list of no-strings-attached women warming my bed. Turns out, I don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah believes she has safeguarded her wounded heart by shunning men and focusing on her new baking business. The thing is, she hasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my three sisters and I form an event-planning business with Hannah as our baker, I have no idea how my life is about to change. As Hannah and I work closely together, the attraction between us becomes irresistible. And complicated. I’ve promised my sisters I wouldn’t mix business with pleasure. But I’ve never been one to follow the rules.</description>

  <description>When the man who date-raped a friend is found not guilty, the women in her book group decide to take matters into their own hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystery and true crime writer Kate Clark Flora’s fascination with people’s criminal tendencies began in the Maine attorney general’s office. Deadbeat dads, people who hurt their kids, and employers’ acts of discrimination aroused her curiosity about human behavior. Her books include seven “strong woman” Thea Kozak mysteries and three gritty police procedurals in her star-reviewed Joe Burgess series. Redemption was the 2013 Maine Literary Award winner for Crime Fiction. Her Edgar-nominated true crime story, Finding Amy, has been optioned for a movie. Flora has also published 15 crime stories in various anthologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she’s not writing or teaching at Grub Street in Boston, Flora is in her garden, waging a constant battle against critters, pests, and her husband’s lawn mower. She’s been married for 35 years to a man who still makes her laugh. She has two wonderful sons, a movie editor and a scientist, two lovely daughters-in-law, and four rescue “granddogs,” Frances, Otis, Harvey, and Daisy. You can follow her on Twitter @kateflora or at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://Facebook.com/kate.flora.92" rel="nofollow"&gt;Facebook.com/kate.flora.92&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a short e-book published by Shebooks--high quality fiction, memoir, and journalism for women, by women</description>

She’s relocated to Leesburg, Virginia, owns a successful bakery, and has a great set of friends—even a friendly ex-husband. She ignores “Whatever Happened To?” speculation and the occasional overly obsessed fan, and flatly turns down a lucrative offer to appear on a reality show called Celebrities in Peril: Child Star Edition. She has an uncomfortable relationship with her Hollywood past, preferring to think of herself as more than a 1990s trivia question. Then one day a mysterious man appears and stirs up her past—all of it—in ways she never imagined...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At long last... The final book in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Hollows series by Kim Harrison!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Morgan's come a long way from the clutzy runner of &lt;i&gt;Dead Witch Walking&lt;/i&gt;. She's faced vampires and werewolves, banshees, witches, and soul-eating demons. She's crossed worlds, channeled gods, and accepted her place as a day-walking demon. She's lost friends and lovers and family, and an old enemy has become something much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But power demands responsibility, and world-changers must always pay a price. That time is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save Ivy's soul and the rest of the living vampires, to keep the demonic ever after and our own world from destruction, Rachel Morgan will risk everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; "Best of Summer" Read&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kate White comes a riveting psychological suspense in which a media star must battle a malevolent enemy who may be disturbingly close to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her on-air job two years ago, television host Robin Trainer has fought her way back and now she’s hotter than ever. With her new show climbing in the ratings and her first book a bestseller, she’s being dubbed a media double threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But suddenly, things begin to go wrong. Small incidents at first: a nasty note left in her purse; her photo shredded. But the obnoxious quickly becomes threatening when the foundation the makeup artist uses burns Robin’s face. It wasn’t an accident—someone had deliberately doctored with the product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An adversary with a dark agenda wants to hurt Robin, and the clues point to someone she works with every day. While she frantically tries to put the pieces together and unmask this hidden foe, it becomes terrifyingly clear that the person responsible isn’t going to stop until Robin loses everything that matters to her . . . including her life.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, Quinn Barton was on her way to the altar to marry Burke Morrison, her high school sweetheart, when something derailed her. Rather, some&lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;derailed her—the Best Man who at the last minute begged her to reconsider the marriage. He told her that Burke had been cheating on her. For a long time. Quinn, stunned, hurt, and confused, struggled with the obligation of fulfilling her guests’ expectations—providing a wedding—and running for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She chose running. With the Best Man. Who happened to be Burke’s brother, Frank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That relationship didn’t work either. How could it, when Quinn had been engaged to, &lt;i&gt;in love with, &lt;/i&gt;Frank’s brother? Quinn opted for neither, and, instead, spends the next seventeen years working in her family’s Middleburg, Virginia, bridal shop, &lt;i&gt;Talk of the Gown&lt;/i&gt;, where she subconsciously does penance for the disservice she did to marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the two men return to town for another wedding, old anger, hurt, and passion resurface. Just because you’ve traded the good guy for the bad guy for &lt;i&gt;no &lt;/i&gt;guy doesn’t mean you have to stay away from love for the rest of your life, does it?</description>

  <description>She's written a recipe for her future, but does it include love?&lt;br /&gt;Katherine 'Kat' Varland is a small town girl, born and raised---and every day, her dreams of owning her own bakery get further away. She has no money, and the cupcake shop she bakes for, Sweetie Pies, seems to get smaller and smaller. Kat might be the sweetheart of Bayou Bend, Louisiana, but she longs to make a name for herself where she can flourish as Kat---not as the girl baking someone else's recipes.&lt;br /&gt;As head coach for the Bayou Bend championship high school football team, Lucas Brannen is used to winning---everything except his best friend's heart. He finally gathers the courage to make a gesture and show Kat his feelings by signing her up for the popular reality TV show Cupcake Combat. But his plan backfires after he realizes the cash prize for the winner also includes a one-year baking contract at one of New York City's most famous pastry houses.&lt;br /&gt;The situation grows sticky when Kat enlists Lucas's help as her baking assistant for the show. Lucas is torn between helping Kat live her dream and selfishly wanting to keep her in town. His plan has always been a dozen acres of land and a farmhouse in Bayou Bend---but Kat is blinded by the stars in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Will Lucas and Kat risk their chance at love in order to achieve their individual dreams? Or will they find that sometimes the most delicious happily-ever-afters begin and end in the same place?</description>

  <description>Have you ever had one of those days where everything that could go wrong does?&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Hayes is dealt that exact hand when disaster strikes at an event she’s managing, giving her publicity for all the wrong reasons, not to mention breaking up with her English boyfriend. And the trouble doesn’t just end there, but when Deborah starts to investigate she can’t help but feel like the universe was trying to warn her.&lt;br /&gt;Determined not to miss any future ‘signs’ and desperate to attract some good luck, she embarks on a journey of divination, dipping her toes into all sorts of spiritual disciplines, Feng Shui, Palm Reading, Tarot Cards... &lt;br /&gt;After scoring an amazing account at work, things look to be on the up, particularly after meeting her gorgeous Irish neighbour. But sometimes the signs are harder to read than we think, and when the latest up and coming sexy Scottish movie star, and a cute Kiwi guy, both take a shine to her, she’s even more desperate for guidance to help her choose. &lt;br /&gt;Bordering on obsession, Deborah gets caught up in asking questions, looking for signs, and searching for hidden meanings and clues. &lt;br /&gt;Can she make the right choice or is she looking for something that has been right in front of her all along?</description>

  <description>Waking up naked next to a good looking man is not a bad way to start the day. Especially since Paisley missed all those opportunities in college, when she was too busy supporting her no good, thankfully now, ex-husband. The problem? This hottie is Hank, her best friend’s older brother, a guy she’s known her entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopping after one night is the right thing to do. Being with him clearly breaks the best friend code, and from his career as a Naval officer to his Boy Scout reputation, everything about him screams monogamy and commitment. Two things Paisley has had enough of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hank presents a “no strings attached” offer, it’s too good to be true. She can enjoy him while still embracing being single. But, poor choices force her to confront old fears of love and loss, and Paisley has to decide if Hank is worth the risk. The alternative is never experiencing the real deal. Or far worse, settling for less.</description>

  <description>Jenna Jax-Anders hit rock bottom in high school. Or so she thought. From rock star heiress to knocked-up has been, she turned it all around, marrying the punk rock baby daddy love of her life. The perfect Hollywood fairytale. Until the day she walked in on him kissing her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she struggles to find herself and redefine the world around her, she faces the challenges of raising her over-achieving teenage daughter, the heartbreak of losing her best friend (backstabbing aside), and emerging from the shadows of two famous last names to find her own identity. Oh, there’s also the tiny issue of her husband’s record label, backed by an anonymous mogul whose morally ambiguous creative direction may ruin them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she doesn’t know about that yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ashlyn Macnamara weaves a delicious tale of two souls torn apart by circumstance and reunited by fate—perfect for fans of Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, and Sabrina Jeffries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Henrietta Upperton is about to marry Alexander Sanford when he rushes off to India to salvage his family’s fortune. Then comes the devastating news that he has wed another. Eight agonizing years later, a storm washes Alexander ashore—injured, widowed, and hunted—and one glimpse of his ruggedly handsome face reawakens the desire Henrietta thought she had buried deep inside. Her body still yearns for his touch, but she’s determined not let him wound her again . . . not this time.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For Alexander, honor always comes first. But only now does he realize that when given the choice between two virtuous deeds, he picked the wrong one. On the run with his life in tatters and a pair of daughters in tow, Alexander burns for Henrietta. He knows he does not deserve forgiveness. And yet he longs to wrap his arms around her warm body once again. What’s more, he is sure the lady craves the same.</description>

  <description>Two wandering souls discover that true love needs no words in this explosive, fantastical novel from Vonnie Davis.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somehow able to telepathically communicate with animals, Paisley Munro has found meaning in her so-called gifts by working as a veterinary assistant. But while traveling to Scotland for a relative’s funeral, Paisley fears that she really has lost her mind. Out in the highlands, she hears distinctly human thoughts coming from a wild bear. Terrified and desperate, she returns to the lodge and collapses in the powerful arms of its owner, a mysterious man with whom she shares a simmering attraction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Creighton Matheson and his fellow shape-shifters have been roaming this land freely for centuries. Now Paisley may inherit his home, putting his kind in grave danger. His mistrust only deepens when he realizes she can read his mind. Yet he cannot deny that this tantalizing woman makes him burn with desire—and hunger for the prospect of a tender love. Now Creighton must decide which would hurt more: revealing the truth or losing Paisley forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jane Feather introduces a sizzling new series that moves from the remote wilds of southwest England to the turbulent royal court, when a lovely young woman is forced into marriage to unite two families—and discovers a most unexpected desire...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headstrong Ariadne Daunt is convinced she loves handsome Gabriel Fawcett, but her grandfather has other plans for her. He decrees that she marry Ivor Chalfont, thus forging a powerful alliance between the two warring families who share ownership of their valley. Given no time to plot an escape, Ari finds herself standing reluctantly at the altar, swearing to honor and obey a man who is not her choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivor has treasured Ari as a friend ever since he was brought to the valley as a child, but now he feels a man's desires. He longs to take the beautiful young woman to his bed and make their marriage more than an empty vow. Ari may believe she loves another man, but Ivor believes otherwise—and he will not rest until he gains her heart, her trust . . . and her passion.</description>

  <description>In Marcia Clark's most electrifying thriller yet, Los Angeles DA Rachel Knight investigates a diabolical high school massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Columbine-style massacre at a high school in the San Fernando Valley has left a community shaken to its core. Two students are identified as the killers. Both are dead, believed to have committed a mutual suicide. But in the aftermath of the shooting, as LA Special Trials prosecutor Rachel Knight and Detective Bailey Keller dig deeper, they realize that the pieces don't add up. Could it be that the two "killers" were themselves victims? And if so, does that mean that the real killers are still on the loose? When someone starts dropping clues that another horrific crime is in the works, Rachel and Bailey scramble desperately to profile their suspect and prevent another killing--before it's too late.</description>

  <description>When the daughter of a billionaire Hollywood director is found murdered after what appears to be a kidnapping gone wrong, Los Angeles Special Trials prosecutor Rachel Knight and Detective Bailey Keller find themselves at the epicenter of a combustible and high-profile court case. Then a prime suspect is revealed to be one of Hollywood's most popular and powerful talent managers--and best friend to the victim's father. With the director vouching for the manager's innocence, the Hollywood media machine commences an all-out war designed to discredit both Rachel and her case. KILLER AMBITION is at once a thrilling ride through the darker side of Tinseltown and a stunning courtroom drama with the brilliant insider's perspective that Marcia Clark is uniquely qualified to give.</description>

  <description>Someone has been watching D.A. Rachel Knight--someone who's Rachel's equal in brains, but with more malicious intentions. It began when a near-impossible case fell into Rachel's lap, the suspectless homicide of a homeless man. In the face of courthouse backbiting and a gauzy web of clues, Rachel is determined to deliver justice. She's got back-up: tough-as-nails Detective Bailey Keller. As Rachel and Bailey stir things up, they're shocked to uncover a connection with the vicious murder of an LAPD cop a year earlier. Something tells Rachel &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; knows the truth, someone who'd kill to keep it secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowing, smart, and riotously entertaining, GUILT BY DEGREES is a thrilling ride through the world of LA courts with the unforgettable Rachel Knight.</description>

  <description>Los Angeles D.A. Rachel Knight is a tenacious, wise-cracking, and fiercely intelligent prosecutor in the city's most elite division. When her colleague, Jake, is found dead at a grisly crime scene, Rachel is shaken to the core. She must take over his toughest case: the assault of a young woman from a prominent family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she can't stop herself from digging deeper into Jake's death, a decision that exposes a world of power and violence and will have her risking her reputation--and her life--to find the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her tremendous expertise in the nuances of L.A. courts and crime, and with a vibrant ensemble cast of characters, Marcia Clark combines intimate detail, riotous humor, and visceral action in a debut thriller that marks the launch of a major new figure on the crime-writing scene.</description>

  <description>If you enjoy new twists on old classics, then Tales From A Broad is a comedic adventure of one woman’s quest to find herself, but the spotlight focuses on her older chaperone, instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-two and feeling not-so-fabulous, Lucy Banks allows her older sister to talk her into accompanying her twenty-four-year-old niece on a trip around Europe. In the past year she has lost her fiancé, her job and her fertility. Embracing her role as spinster aunt seems to be Lucy’s only option, until she embarks on a romantic adventure through London, Amsterdam, Munich, Paris and Florence. Will a room with a view and a handsome stranger be enough to open her heart and mind to new experiences? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tales From A Broad promises to draw readers into a light-hearted tale of emotional development, self-discovery and love.</description>

  <description>One of the savviest single urbanites ever to take up sleuthing and still look great, Bailey Weggins made her smashing debut in Kate White’s &lt;i&gt;If Looks Could Kill&lt;/i&gt;, a dishy and delectable &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller and the first Reading With Ripa Book Club selection. Now the &lt;i&gt;Gloss&lt;/i&gt; magazine true-crime writer returns in a story of high style and low murder that goes behind the salons and saunas of a ritzy country spa to uncover… &lt;i&gt;A Body to Die For&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her last adventure, Bailey Weggins is one tired reporter in need of R &amp;amp; R. So when an old family friend invites her for a free weekend at the Cedar Inn in rural Massachusetts, she jumps at the chance to leave Manhattan for some major pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the elegant mid-19th-century hideaway, with its Asian-inspired spa, Bailey is soon luxuriating to the hypnotic sound of water spilling over stones and the soothing scent of green-tea candles. Yet mayhem is mere steps away, as Bailey discovers when she literally stumbles across a corpse wrapped mummy-style in a treatment room. Suddenly, her time-out is transformed into a full-tilt murder investigation. Bailey hadn’t expected to meet anyone other than socialites slathering their cellulite with Shea butter, but now she’s dealing with a list of suspects dirtier than a mud bath: a spurned lover, a shady husband, and a group of employees who seem to be hiding something. And against her better judgment, she can’t seem to keep her own hands off the sexy homicide detective assigned to the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to help her mother’s friend, the owner of the spa, Bailey finds herself chasing clues across state lines just as another death sweeps her into the sights of a vicious killer. And this time, the body in the mud wrap could be her own&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Meet Bailey Weggins, the thirty-something, single-again true crime writer for a leading Manhattan woman's magazine. Smart and savvy, she's got a sixth sense when it comes to seeing the truth in a story-especially if it's murder. Bailey's in bed with her commitment-challenged lover K.C. when she gets a frantic call from her high-maintenance boss at Gloss magazine. Grabbing coffee and a cab outside her Greenwich Village apartment-the consolation prize in her divorce settlement-Bailey reluctantly heads uptown. At Cat Jones's Upper East Side town house, she finds something that seriously clashes with the chic décor: the dead body of the family's line-in nanny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bailey-unofficially-delves into the murdered girl's past, she finds no shortage of A-list suspects. But when a startling discovery suggests that Cat may have been the intended victim, Bailey is suddenly up to her bed head in high-profile investigation that's perfect fodder for a tabloid headline: &lt;i&gt;Is someone trying to kill the editor's of women's magazines?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the spotlight on New York's glitzy media world, Bailey interviews back-stabbing editors, straying husbands, and one sexy, six-feet two psychologist who could make her decide to kick K.C. to the curb. Sporting her pair of red slingbacks and armed with the investigative skills she's honed as a true crime reporter, she sets out on a search that takes her from Manhattan's exclusive Carnegie-Hill area-the nanny heartland of America-to the ritzy weekend estates of Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Bailey will need all her street smarts and some lightning-fast detective work to catch a killer who could end up deleting her name from the masthead for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Okay, I admit it…I didn’t do it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is normal, right?  I mean, just because everyone I know has talked like they’ve already done it doesn’t mean that they’re telling the truth…right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’m asking for that much. I don’t need the perfect guy. I don’t need candlelight or roses. Honestly, I don’t even need a real bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guys I know complain that girls are always looking for Mr. Right—do I have to wear a sign that says I’m only looking for Mr. Right Now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo…anyone out there want sex? Anyone? Hello? Just for fun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to die a virgin. One way or another I am going to make this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, what have I got to lose? Besides the obvious.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In bestselling author Dianne Emley’s chilling new paranormal thriller, a beautiful woman’s romantic past comes back to haunt her in the form of an otherworldly visitor seeking justice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gorgeous and successful, Rory Langtry seemed to have it all. Daughter of a movie star and sister of a supermodel, Rory was engaged to sexy artist, Junior Lara. But her bright future went dark one terrible, bloody night that left her sister dead and the accused murderer—Junior—in an extended coma.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now, five years later, Rory appears to have put the past behind her. She has a wonderful new fiancé and heads a successful cosmetics company. Yet dark secrets threaten. Across town, Junior lies close to death but before he departs he seeks to clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; It starts with a feeling. It turns into a vision. Soon Rory is having sensations that only Junior could experience—from the horrifying to the erotic. Then she learns details about the awful night that only Junior could know, newfound knowledge with potentially fatal consequences. When another act of violence rocks her family, Rory plunges deeper into the unsolved mystery, led by an inexplicable visitor to a dangerous time and place where all will be revealed at last. But until then, Junior will not let her go.</description>

  <description>The moment Lilith Straight dies, the Devil appears to claim her soul and cash in on a family curse. Now, Lilith has no choice but to work for him. The job is bad, the boss is worse and she can’t imagine how she’ll explain her new reincarnation to her eight-year-old daughter. But then an arrogant, yet oh so yummy, incubus shows up…and hell heats up just a little more.</description>

  <description>Nobody believes in werewolves.&lt;br /&gt;That's just what Paul McHew and his friends are counting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They and their kind roam our city streets: a race of people from whom the terrible legend stems; now living among us invisibly after centuries of persecution through fear and ignorance. Superficially Caucasian but physiologically very different, with lunar rhythms so strong that during the three days of the full moon they are almost completely controlled by their hormonal instincts, you might have cursed them as just another group of brawling youths or drunken gang-bangers. Now at the point of extinction, if they are to survive their existence must remain restricted to mere stories and legend, but, paradoxically, they also must marry outside their society in order to persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The responsibility for negotiating this knife-edge is given to Paul, who runs the streets with his friends during the full moon, keeping them out of real trouble and its resultant difficult questions. Having succeeded for years, he finds his real test of leadership comes when he meets Susan, a potential life-mate, to whom he will have to reveal his true identity if he is ever to leave his pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10% of the author's royalties will be donated to WWF, the World Wildlife Fund.</description>

  <description>Never were there two less similar identical twins than Clare and Rosie Marwood. Though they were born within three minutes of each other and spent their childhoods dressed in matching outfits, they’ve grown up to have less in common than Kim Kardashian and the Duchess of Cambridge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So both women are horrified when a luggage mix-up means that sensible Clare must attend a company conference in the United States with Rosie’s suitcase full of pink, frills and stripper heels, while flamboyant Rosie heads for a friend’s destination wedding in Italy's Tuscany with Clare’s case full of suiting and sensible courts. Both believe wearing the other’s clothes is going to ruin their chances: Clare’s of getting a promotion and Rosie’s of getting a snog. But as three days of literally having to walk in each other’s shoes unfold, will the sisters discover they should try to be more like each other after all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This exclusive new novella (short novel at around 100 pages) by Chrissie Manby explores sisterhood, identity and love in a thoroughly summery way.</description>

  <description>Nessia Stephenson's world was safe until a threat from a neighbouring clan forces her to accept a betrothal to a man whose family can offer her the protection she needs. The real threat lies in her intense attraction to the man who arranged the match—the clan's chief and her intended’s brother, Fergus MacKay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When powerful warlord Fergus MacKay arranges a marriage for his younger brother, William, he has no idea the price will be his own heart. Fergus is captivated by the wildly beautiful Nessia, a woman he can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the feud between the MacKay and Sutherland clans escalates, Nessia, William, and Fergus all must make sacrifices for their future. Longing and loss, honour and duty. How can love triumph under such desperate circumstances?</description>

  <description>Aileana Chattan suffers a devastating loss, then discovers she is to wed neighboring chief and baron, James MacIntosh -- a man she despises and whose loyalty deprived her of the father she loved. Despite him and his traitorous clan, Aileana will do her duty, but she doesn't have to like it or him. But when the MacIntosh awakens something inside her so absolute and consuming, she is forced to question everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James MacIntosh is a nobleman torn between tradition and progress. He must make a sacrifice if he is to help Scotland move forward as a unified country. Forced to sign a marriage contract years earlier binding Lady Aileana to him, James must find a way to break it, or risk losing all -- including his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the wild and rugged Highlands near Inverness to the dungeons of Edinburgh Castle, James and Aileana’s preconceptions of honor, duty and love are challenged at every adventurous turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Catch a professional assassin: top priority. Find a failure-to-appear and collect big bucks: top score. How she’ll pull it all off: top secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trenton, New Jersey’s favorite used-car dealer, Jimmy Poletti, was caught selling a lot more than used cars out of his dealerships. Now he’s out on bail and has missed his date in court, and bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is looking to bring him in. Leads are quickly turning into dead ends, and all too frequently into dead bodies. Even Joe Morelli, the city’s hottest cop, is struggling to find a clue to the suspected killer’s whereabouts. These are desperate times, and they call for desperate measures. So Stephanie is going to have to do something she really doesn’t want to do: protect former hospital security guard and general pain in her behind Randy Briggs. Briggs was picking up quick cash as Poletti’s bookkeeper and knows all his boss’s dirty secrets. Now Briggs is next on Poletti’s list of people to put six feet under.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To top things off, Ranger—resident security expert and Stephanie’s greatest temptation—has been the target of an assassination plot. He’s dodged the bullet this time, but if Ranger wants to survive the next attempt on his life, he’ll have to enlist Stephanie’s help and reveal a bit more of his mysterious past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Death threats, highly trained assassins, highly untrained assassins, and Stark Street being overrun by a pack of feral Chihuahuas are all in a day’s work for Stephanie Plum. The real challenge is dealing with her Grandma Mazur’s wild bucket list. A boob job and getting revenge on Joe Morelli’s Grandma Bella can barely hold a candle to what’s number one on the list—but that’s top secret.</description>

  <description>This is the remarkable story of one endearing dog's search for his purpose over the course of several lives. More than just another charming dog story, this touches on the universal quest for an answer to life's most basic question: Why are we here? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised to find himself reborn as a rambunctious golden haired puppy after a tragically short life as a stray mutt, Bailey's search for his new life's meaning leads him into the loving arms of 8 year old Ethan. During their countless adventures Bailey joyously discovers how to be a good dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this life as a beloved family pet is not the end of Bailey's journey. Reborn as a puppy yet again, Bailey wonders, will he ever find his purpose? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartwarming, insightful, and often laugh out loud funny, this book is not only the emotional and hilarious story of a dog's many lives, but also a dog's eye commentary on human relationships and the unbreakable bonds between man and man's best friend. This story teaches us that love never dies, that our true friends are always with us, and that every creature on earth is born with a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;--front flap</description>

  <description>Sometimes looks can be deceiving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabel's not surprised when nobody recognizes her at her 10 year reunion. The spotty fat teen nicknamed AnnaBall by the school bullies is long gone. But standing on the edge of the popular crowd, she still feels like that girl. That is, until Jack, her teen crush, starts flirting with her. Much to her amusement, he has mistaken her for Christy Blake, Annabel's chief tormenter before she moved to France in their last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just a bit of fun at first, letting Jack believe she's Christy. After all, he was nuts about her before she said au revoir to England. And when he asks Annabel out, the fun becomes something even more interesting. The more they date the deeper they fall for each other. So what if Annabel has to fib a little to keep up the façade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the lies start compounding, and she realizes that they're falling in love, she has to tell him who she really is. But she'll lose the love of her life if she does.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A romantic comedy featuring a crashed wedding, a puppy with attitude, and a second chance romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling for the groom…Three days before leaving Ireland on the adventure of a lifetime, Fiona Byrne returns to her hometown to attend the family wedding from hell. When she discovers the drunken vows she exchanged with the groom during a wild Las Vegas trip eight years previously mean they're legally married, her future plans ricochet out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin Maguire's life is low on drama, high on stability, and free of pets. But Gavin hadn't reckoned on Fiona blasting back into his life and crashing his wedding. In the space of twenty-four hours, he loses a fiancée and a job, and gains a wife and a puppy. Can he salvage his bland-but-stable life? More importantly, can he resist losing his heart to Fiona all over again?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 New York Times-bestselling author Nora Roberts comes a novel of a woman who needs nothing, a man who sees everything, and the web of deceit, greed, and danger that brings them together—and could tear them apart . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When professional house-sitter Lila Emerson witnesses a murder/suicide from her current apartment-sitting job, life as she knows it takes a dramatic turn. Suddenly, the woman with no permanent ties finds herself almost wishing for one. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist Ashton Archer knows his brother isn’t capable of violence—against himself or others. He recruits Lila, the only eyewitness, to help him uncover what happened. Ash longs to paint her as intensely as he hungers to touch her. But their investigation draws them into a rarified circle where priceless antiques are bought, sold, gambled away, and stolen, where what you possess is who you are, and where what you desire becomes a deadly obsession. . . .</description>

  <description>Bride McTierney has had it with men. They're cheap, self-centered, and never love her for who she is. But though she prides herself on being independent, deep down she still yearns for a knight in shining armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just never expected her knight in shining armor to have a shiny coat of fur...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly and tortured, Vane Kattalakis isn't what he seems. Most women lament that their boyfriends are dogs. In Bride's case, hers is a wolf. A Were-Hunter wolf. Wanted dead by his enemies, Vane isn't looking for a mate. But the Fates have marked Bride as his. Now he has three weeks to either convince Bride that the supernatural is real or he will spend the rest of his life neutered—something no self-respecting wolf can accept...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does a wolf convince a human to trust him with her life when his enemies are out to end his? In the world of the Were-Hunters, it really is dog-eat-dog. And only one alpha male can win.</description>

      <![CDATA[Awesome book! Vane is definitely my favorite of all the other Dark Hunters and Were Hunters in the series. Must be the animal in him. He is a tortured soul filled with pain but doesn't lash out at others like Zarek did. I also liked that the heroine is portrayed as a regular woman instead of Miss...]]>

  <description>On holiday leave from the service, Gabriel McQueen is sent into a brewing ice storm to make sure that his father’s distant neighbor, Lolly Helton, who has fallen out of contact, is safe and sound. It’s a trip that Gabriel would rather not make, given the bitter winter weather—and the icy conditions that have always existed between him and Lolly. Arriving at Lolly’s home, Gabriel spots strangers through the windows—one of them packing a weapon—and kicks into combat mode. But once Lolly is rescued, the heat—and the hunt—are on. Snowbound, unarmed, and literally under the gun, Gabriel and Lolly must depend on each other to endure the merciless forces of nature and evade the ruthless enemy out in the blackness of the silent night—and out for their blood.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Hope In a Jar, Secrets of a Shoe Addict,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shoe Addicts Anonymous,&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about old rivalries, deep secrets, and the three things all women wish they were,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, when they were teenagers, Holly and Nicola were the outsiders at summer camp. Holly was the plump one, a dreamer who longed to be an artist. Nicola was the shy, plain one who wanted nothing more than to be beautiful. Their cabin nemesis was Lexi. Rich, spoiled, evil Lexi. One night, Holly and Nicola team up to pull one, daring act of vengeance. But they never dream that this one act will have repercussions that will reach into the future, even twenty years later. And they never realize the secret pain that Lexi holds very close, and how their need for revenge costs Lexi a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Holly is a successful gallery owner, who has put her own artistic dreams on hold. She struggles with her weight and for approval from her constantly-criticizing boyfriend. Nicola, is an almost-famous actress who believes that one little plastic surgery fix is just what she needs to put her over the edge into fame. And Lexi…Lexi is down on her luck and totally broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly will do anything to be thin. Lexi will do anything to be rich. And Nicola will do anything to be pretty.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The perfect life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A successful lawyer and loving mother, Nina Bloom would do anything to protect the life she's built in New York--including lying to everyone, even her daughter, about her past. But when an innocent man is framed for murder, she knows that she can't let him pay for the real killer's crimes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The perfect lie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina's secret life began 18 years ago. She had looks to die for, a handsome police-officer husband, and a carefree life in Key West. When she learned she was pregnant with their first child, her happiness was almost overwhelming. But Nina's world is shattered when she unearths a terrible secret that causes her to run for her life and change her identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The perfect way to die&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, years later, Nina risks everything she's earned to return to Florida and confront the murderous evil she fled. In a story of wrenching suspense, James Patterson gives us his most head-spinning, action-filled story yet--a Hitchcock-like blend of unquenchable drama and pleasure.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the humorous, heartfelt new novel by the author of &lt;i&gt;The Next Thing on My List, &lt;/i&gt;a personal organizer must somehow convince a reclusive artist to give up her hoarding ways and let go of the stuff she’s hung on to for decades.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucy Bloom is broke, freshly dumped &lt;/b&gt;by her boyfriend, and forced to sell her house to send her nineteen-year-old son to drug rehab. Although she’s lost it all, she’s determined to start over. So when she’s offered a high-paying gig helping clear the clutter from the home of reclusive and eccentric painter Marva Meier Rios, Lucy grabs it. Armed with the organizing expertise she gained while writing her book, &lt;i&gt;Things Are Not People, &lt;/i&gt;and fueled by a burning desire to get her life back on track, Lucy rolls up her sleeves to take on the mess that fills every room of Marva’s huge home. Lucy soon learns that the real challenge may be taking on Marva, who seems to love the objects in her home too much to let go of any of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While trying to stay on course toward a strict deadline—and with an ex-boyfriend back in the picture, a new romance on the scene, and her son’s rehab not going as planned—Lucy discovers that Marva isn’t just hoarding, she is also hiding a big secret. The two form an unlikely bond, as each learns from the other that there are those things in life we keep, those we need to let go—but it’s not always easy to know the difference.</description>

  <description>One by one, children of New York's wealthiest are taken hostage. But the criminal doesn't crave money or power--he only wants to ask the elite if they know the price others pay for their luxurious lifestyles. And, if they don't, he corrects their ignorance--by killing them.&lt;p&gt;To Detective Michael Bennett, it becomes clear that these murders are linked and must be part of a greater, more public demonstration. With the city thrown into chaos, he is forced to team up with FBI agent Emily Parker, and the two set out to capture the killer before he begins his most public lesson yet--a deadly message for the entire city to witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the bestselling author who brought you the Alex Cross novels comes James Patterson's most action-packed series yet. With the heart-pounding suspense that only Patterson delivers, &lt;i&gt;Worst Case&lt;/i&gt;l leave you gasping for breath until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the shocking first page to the last exhilarating scene, &lt;i&gt;Worst Case &lt;/i&gt;is a non-stop thriller from "America's #1 storyteller" &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;–Forbes).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE BEACH...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A breathtakingly beautiful supermodel disappears from a swimsuit photo shoot at the most glamorous hotel in Hawaii. Only hours after she goes missing, Kim McDaniels's parents receive a terrifying phone call. Fearing the worst, they board the first flight to Maui and begin the hunt for their daughter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...WILL NEVER BE...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-cop Ben Hawkins, now a reporter for the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times,&lt;/em&gt; gets the McDaniels assignment. The ineptitude of the local police force defies belief--Ben has to start his own investigation for Kim McDaniels to have a prayer. And for Ben to have the story of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...THE SAME FOR YOU AGAIN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while, the killer sets the stage for his next production. His audience expects the best--and they won't be disappointed. Swimsuit is a heart-pounding story of fear and desire, transporting you to a place where beauty and murder collide and unspeakable horrors are hidden within paradise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;trespass \'trespes\ n: a transgression of law involving one's obligations to God or to one's neighbor; a violation of moral law; an offense; a sin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what may be her most unsettling novel to date, Sue Grafton's &lt;i&gt;T is for Trespass&lt;/i&gt; is also her most direct confrontation with the forces of evil. Beginning slowly with the day-to-day life of a private eye, Grafton suddenly shifts from the voice of Kinsey Millhone to that of Solana Rojas, introducing readers to a chilling sociopath. Rojas is not her birth name. It is an identity she cunningly stole, an identity that gives her access to private caregiving jobs. The true horror of the novel builds with excruciating tension as the reader foresees the awfulness that lies ahead. The suspense lies in whether Millhone will realize what is happening in time to intervene. Though set in the late eighties, &lt;i&gt;T is for Trespass&lt;/i&gt; could not be more topical: identity theft; elder abuse; betrayal of trust; the breakdown in the institutions charged with caring for the weak and the dependent. It reveals a terrifying but all-too-real rip in the social fabric. Once again, Grafton opens up new territory with startling results.</description>

  <description>When the pounds start falling off Katie, founder and president of London’s most popular social club for the calorie-challenged, it seems like a dream come true. But as the overweight stigma recedes and her life starts to change, she faces losing more than the inches around her waist. Everything that’s important to her – her closest friends, boyfriend, and acceptance into the club itself – are at stake in a world where thin is the new fat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A funny, heart-warming story about overcoming the prejudices we hold, no matter where we tip the scales.</description>

  <description>Nell knows a secret about her perfect, beautiful sister Layla. If she tells, it could blow their world apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nell and Layla were little, Nell used to call them Nellayla. Because to Nell, there was no difference between where she started and her adored big sister ended. They're a unit; divorce made them rely on each other early on, so when one pulls away, what is the other to do? But now, Nell's a freshman in high school and Layla is changing, secretive. And then Nell discovers why. Layla is involved with one of their teachers. And even though Nell tries to support Layla, to understand that she's happy and in love, Nell struggles with her true feelings: it's wrong, and she must do something about it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Rose delivers her latest pulse-pounding suspense novel, where the line between the virtual world and everyday reality blurs when it comes to murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Wilson's face was once scarred by a vicious assault. Terrified and ashamed, she escaped to the online realm, where she could choose the face she allowed people to see. Years later, her outer scars faded and inner scars buried, Eve has fought her way back to the real world and is determined to help others do the same. Now a graduate student moonlighting as a bartender, Eve researches the addictive powers of online communities. When her test subjects begin turning up dead as a result of apparent suicides, she doesn't know where to turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide detective Noah Webster is one of the few people who believe the victims are connected murders. Eve becomes Noah's online guide and realizes that the handsome detective may have secret scars as painful as her own. As Eve and Noah chase a killer who is always one step ahead of them, together they try to overcome the tragedies of their pasts and learn to trust again, but they soon discover that danger is much closer than they think.</description>

  <description>Donny is obsessed with his housemate, Selena – but his love is unrequited. He enthusiastically accepts her willing friendship, which only fuels his deepening fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaz is their crazy landlord who likes sleeping with women – lots of them. He takes pleasure in educating the once innocent Donny in the hedonistic pleasures of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll. It blows Donny’s mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selena is engaged to Melvin – the perfect man – but is also keen to befriend the ever-demanding Donny ... until she falls pregnant and her wedding looms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donny expresses his true feelings at the wedding, causing mayhem and anger. But there remains a chink of hope: perhaps Selena’s marriage to Melvin is not quite as perfect as it seems.</description>

  <description>In this new series told from multiple perspectives, teen members of a search and rescue team discover a dead body in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexis, Nick, and Ruby have very different backgrounds: Alexis has spent her life covering for her mom’s mental illness, Nick’s bravado hides his fear of not being good enough, and Ruby just wants to pursue her eccentric interests in a world that doesn’t understand her. When the three teens join Portland County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue, they are teamed up to search for a autistic man lost in the woods. What they find instead is a dead body. In a friendship that will be forged in danger, fear, and courage, the three team up to find the girl’s killer—before he can strike one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first book in April Henry’s Point Last Seen YA mystery series is full of riveting suspense, putting readers in the middle of harrowing rescues and crime scene investigations.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Pistol Rock, Texas where everyone knows secrets last about as long as the sporadic west Texas rain showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laney Briggs has long been considered reckless by the denizens of her hometown, but she’s finally turned it all around—she’s happily engaged to the local veterinarian and she’s become a Pistol Rock deputy sheriff. Everything’s fine and dandy—until a dead body turns up and her ex, Texas Ranger Gunner Wilson, decides to stick his boots into the town’s first murder case.   Of course, the troublesome cowboy’s rugged good looks and T-shirt-straining muscles are already leaving Laney knee-deep in hot water, but she’ll be damned if she lets Gunner trample all over her turf. She’s decided that, instead of conflict, she wants a contented, steady life with her vet—a life in which Gunner Wilson and his seemingly endless ability to undermine her resolve and her libido plays no part. Still, it’s hard to keep her head as forbidden sparks ignite and suspicions arise between old rivals and old flames. And when the bodies start to pile up, Laney has to ask the lethal bad boy for a hand—and a truce in exchange for his help. But after uncovering the pack of lies surrounding not only her job but her heart…  Having an ex-boyfriend as an ally might not be the best idea, but it’s certainly the most reckless, and Laney has always been pretty reckless…  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After fifteen years, Dr. Cyrus Mills returns to rural Vermont to inherit the Bedside Manor for Sick Animals, the failing veterinary practice of his recently deceased and long-estranged father. Cyrus, a veterinary pathologist far more comfortable with cold clinical facts than living, breathing animals (not to mention their quirky, demanding owners), intends to sell the practice and get out of town as fast as he can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then his first patient—a down-on-her-luck golden retriever named Frieda Fuzzypaws—wags her way through the door, and suddenly life gets complicated. With the help of a black Labrador gifted in the art of swallowing underwear, a Persian cat determined to expose her owner’s lover as a gold digger, and the allure of a feisty, pretty waitress from the local diner, Cyrus gets caught up in a new community and its endearing residents, both human and animal. Sensing he may have misjudged the past, he begins to realize it’s not just his patients that need healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Patron Saint of Lost Dogs&lt;/i&gt; is a winsome tale of new beginnings, forgiveness, and the joy of finding your way home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fiendishly clever dystopian novel for the digital age, &lt;i&gt;The Word Exchange&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, stylized and decidedly original debut about the dangers of technology and the power of the printed word.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the not so distant future, the forecasted "death of print" has become a reality. Bookstores, libraries, newspapers and magazines are a thing of the past, as we spend our time glued to handheld devices called Memes that not only keep us in constant communication, but have become so intuitive as to hail us cabs before we leave our offices, order take out at the first growl of a hungry stomach, and even create and sell language itself in a marketplace called The Word Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anana Johnson works with her father Doug at the &lt;i&gt;North American Dictionary of the English Language &lt;/i&gt;(NADEL), where Doug is hard at work on the final edition that will ever be printed. Doug is a staunchly anti-Meme, anti-tech intellectual who fondly remembers the days when people used email (everything now is text or video-conference) to communicate--or even actually spoke to one another for that matter. One evening, Doug disappears from the NADEL offices leaving a single written clue: ALICE. It's a code word he and Anana devised to signal if one of them ever fell into harm's way. And thus begins Anana's journey down the proverbial rabbit hole. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joined by Bart, her bookish NADEL colleague (who is secretly in love with her), Anana's search for Doug will take her into dark basement incinerator rooms, underground passages of the Mercantile Library, secret meetings of the anonymous "Diachronic Society," the boardrooms of the evil online retailing site Synchronic, and ultimately to the hallowed halls of the Oxford English Dictionary--the spiritual home of the written word. As Ana pieces together what is going on, and Bart gets sicker and sicker with the strange "Word flu" that has spread worldwide causing people to speak in gibberish, Alena Graedon crafts a fresh, cautionary tale that is at once a technological thriller, and a thoughtful meditation on the price of technology and the unforeseen, though very real, dangers of the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Dr. Cyrus Mills returned home after inheriting his estranged father's veterinary practice, The Bedside Manor for Sick Animals, the last thing he wanted was to stay in Eden Falls, Vermont, a moment longer than absolutely necessary. However, the previously reclusive veterinarian pathologist quickly found that he actually enjoyed treating animals and getting to know the eccentric residents of the tiny provincial town-especially an alluring waitress named Amy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Cyrus is now determined to make Bedside Manor thrive. Not an easy goal, given that Healthy Paws, the national veterinary chain across town, will stop at nothing to crush its mom-and-pop competitor. And the rival vet practice isn't Cyrus's only competition; a handsome stranger shows up out of nowhere who clearly has a mysterious past with Amy. To top it off, Cyrus finds himself both the guardian of a very unique orphaned dog and smack in the middle of serious small town drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charming sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Patron Saint of Lost Dogs&lt;/em&gt; is a wild and delightful ride through one jam- packed week, where Cyrus must figure out how to outsmart the evil veterinary conglomerate, win back Amy's heart, solve several tricky veterinary cases, find a home for an orphaned dog, and detangle himself from an absurd case of mistaken identity. DOG GONE, BACK SOON brims with Nick Trout's trademark humor, charm, and captivating animal stories, and is proof that all dogs, lost or not, on four feet or two, deserve a second chance.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A determined young police constable goes it alone against an enigmatic killer and her bosses in a series debut for fans of Sophie Hannah and Tana French&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Burning Man. It's the name the media has given a brutal murderer who has beaten four young women to death before setting their bodies ablaze in secluded areas of London's parks. And now there's a fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maeve Kerrigan is an ambitious detective constable, keen to make her mark on the murder task force. Her male colleagues believe Maeve's empathy makes her weak, but the more she learns about the latest victim, Rebecca Haworth, from her grieving friends and family, the more determined Maeve becomes to bring her murderer to justice. But how do you catch a killer no one has seen when so much of the evidence has gone up in smoke?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maeve's frenetic hunt for a killer in Jane Casey's gripping series debut will entrance even the most jaded suspense readers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the Mystic Quarter...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian Spectre knows what happens after you die because the seventeen-year-old mystic seer can see the future of her clients even after they've passed on. And that's not even her coolest power... she can be in two places at once. Problem is, her heart can only be in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supernatural abilities aside, she's a typical high school senior torn between two guys. But that gets put on the back burner when she discovers the father she had long assumed was dead is actually alive, with unique powers of his own. He's a technopath, with the ability to interface his mind with technology. And he's got a plan to take down society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless Jillian can stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Jillian Spectre&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a very special girl who learns that the power of love is more important than supernatural powers.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Hot sun. Blue waves. New romances. Old secrets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gemma had her summer all planned out, but it takes a sharp turn when she gets dumped and finds herself back in the Hamptons after a five-year absence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being there puts her at risk of bumping into Hallie, her former best friends (that is, before Gemma ruined her life). But people don't hold grudges forever. Do they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gemma intends on making amends, but a small case of mistaken identity causes the people she knew years ago—including Hallie and her dreamy brother, Josh—to believe she's someone else. As though the summer wasn't complicated enough already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with summer sun, boys, and friendships gone sour, Katie Finn's first novel in the Broken Hearts and Revenge series sizzles and delights.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;He&amp;amp;#8217;s Just Not That Into You&lt;/i&gt; for the iPhone generation&amp;amp;#8212;a frank, funny, and refreshingly helpful guide to dating in the age of social media from the creators of the wildly popular blog HeTexted.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Glamour&lt;/i&gt; magazine writes, &amp;amp;#8220;There are two types of women in the world: 1) Women who&amp;amp;#8217;ve gotten a vague or confusing text message from their crush and analyzed how to respond for hours with their girlfriends (&amp;amp;#8220;But what does this mean?&amp;amp;#8221;); and 2) Liars.&amp;amp;#8221; Today, where everyone is plugged into social media 24/7, lines are blurred and a ton of new confusion exists about whether or not a guy is into you. As any woman who&amp;amp;#8217;s recently been on a date knows, no one leaves home without his or her phone, and it is literally on the table or in use at some point on every date. So how can women use social media and texting to their advantage and suss out his true feelings? &lt;i&gt;He Texted&lt;/i&gt; is here to clear up any mysteries about texting, friending, following, liking, LOLing, and poking that have become commonplace in the smartphone era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founders of HeTexted.com Lisa Winning and Carrie Henderson McDermott and their stable of &amp;amp;#8220;Bros&amp;amp;#8221; go through the most common and confusing romantic cyber situations using actual text exchanges. Offering concrete advice, they&amp;amp;#8217;ll explain what&amp;amp;#8217;s really going on in each scenario on a practical and emotional level, lay down a verdict about the guy&amp;amp;#8217;s intentions, and establish clear-cut rules for any present and future conduct. Hilarious and helpful in equal measure, this is the book that everyone who texts, Tweets, or uses Facebook should own.</description>
