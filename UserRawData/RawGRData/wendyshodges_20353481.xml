  <description>For Sidney Hale, rescuing dogs is more than a hobby. It’s a calling. A deep-seated need. An unstoppable compulsion. For reasons so unsettling, she shares them with no one…until she meets Decker. After coming to her rescue while Sidney battled to save a dog—literally—the gorgeous SEAL proves he can be trusted with her secrets, her safety…maybe even her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving an abused pit bull from a suspected dog fighter brings Decker “Gumby” Kincade not only the dog he’s always wanted, but the first woman in ages to catch his interest. Sidney’s reason for rescuing Hannah, and animals like her, is shocking…but it makes Gumby want her even more. Her harrowing past has made her the strong, brave, compassionate woman she is today. She could be The One…if Gumby can help curb her habit of putting herself squarely in danger’s path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he may be too late. Hannah’s previous owner is enraged over her loss…and looking for revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Securing Sidney is the 2nd book in the SEAL of Protection: Legacy Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This story examines the stark reality of dogfighting and other animal abuse, and includes brief descriptions that may be unpleasant for some readers. .</description>

  <description>Since the beginning of time Dragons have existed and live in solitude among their own clans and traditions. Enya lives in the human world but is aware of the fact she’s a Dragon. She never encountered any others of her kind and doesn’t remember her past. She craves to find out more about herself until she’s suddenly faced with a presumptuous, old-fashioned biker who’d rather demand information than willingly provide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaughn, Dragon shifter and President of the Dragons Charter, has been the leader of his clan for decades. His clan has been facing problems due to ancient traditions which complicate their very existence. When Vaughn becomes aware of the horrific fact of the existence of a half-blood, he’s dead set to handle this abomination accordingly; for a Dragon needs to be a pure blood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Dragon shifter is adamant, stubborn, and hot-tempered though evolution has a way to make you see reason within havoc. Can ancient traditions withstand modern times? Or will clan members refuse allegiance, leaving Vaughn and Enya no other option then to fight for the right of existence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Death by Reaper MC series can be read as a standalone story, featuring a new couple. For a greater reading experience and background storyline, recommended reading order:&lt;br /&gt;Hellhounds Death by Reaper MC #1&lt;br /&gt;Vampires Death by Reaper MC #2&lt;br /&gt;Demons Death by Reaper MC #3&lt;br /&gt;Dragons Death by Reaper MC #4</description>

  <description>Dubbed the “American Princess” after her rescue from months in the hands of ISIS, soldier and firefighter Penelope Turner has struggled silently since her return to Texas. The media, the danger of her job, the pressure of knowing lives are in her hands…all of it and more has combined to slowly fill Penelope with seething guilt and doubt. Missing memories from her moment of capture cause even more angst. Is she responsible for the deaths of her Army patrol unit? And without knowing what happened, how can she be trusted by her fellow firefighters—or trust them in return? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Worse…how can she ever be worthy of the man who believes in her most? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took seeing Penelope in the hands of terrorists—in viral videos seen around the world—for Tucker “Moose” Jacobs to realize just how much he loved his fellow firefighter. He died waiting for her rescue, then died all over again when Penelope abruptly left Texas, trying to outrun her past. Now that she’s returned, the kid gloves are off. Moose is a patient man, but even he has his limits. He loves Penelope, and he knows it’s past time for her to face her fears, and remember she has an entire tribe of friends who not only have her back, but need Pen to have theirs, as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, Penelope will have to trust Moose, her friends, and most of all herself, if she’s going to make peace with her past…and have any kind of future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Penelope is the 15th and final book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings. Penelope’s story started in Protecting the Future, and over the years, she’s struggled with her inner demons. Read on to see her finally get her HEA.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triton:&lt;/strong&gt; I took care of my sister the best I could after our parents died. I wasn’t the best big brother. I had my club to think about and dealing with a teenager wasn’t high on my list of things to do. Neither was that little surfer girl. She was mouthy and full of passion, something I wanted. But with all good things, it had to come to an end. She had bigger plans for her life and I wasn’t one to keep her tied down. Or was I?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saylor:&lt;/strong&gt;  I had a plan for my life. I wanted to surf. I was good at it. Life had other plans for me though. Plans I wasn’t sure I wanted. Triton came into my world and ripped apart like a hurricane but he was always there for me. Now that I have the chance to further my career, I have to decide if I want to take it and leave him behind. Or do I stay with the one that cares about me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>What would you do if a stranger deliberately kissed you?&lt;br /&gt;What if that stranger was younger, hotter than hell and your husband had already traded you in for a much younger model?&lt;br /&gt;Now what if his smoking hot kiss served as the ultimate payback for you being wronged... would you welcome it then?&lt;br /&gt;Seeking sanctuary from a rainstorm inside a wine bar alone Billie Collier’s haven quickly became her hell when of all the places in New York City her soon-to-be ex-husband was also already in there, with his tall pretty homewrecker.&lt;br /&gt;When another rain-soaked refugee swept inside dressed in a high dollar suit he does so with fear in his eyes. Drenched, Sawyer Wild breathed raggedly as he shrugged himself out of his jacket and quickly planted himself in the last empty chair in the wine bar—the one directly across from Billie.&lt;br /&gt;Forced together by circumstance she seeks solace in Sawyer’s flirty banter which strokes her neglected ego, and as time passes and wine loosens her tongue she confesses Logan’s presence and her current humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;Although relative strangers, he quickly relates to Billie's desperate need to save face and with her curious husband approaching can Billie find her courage to trust and dare Sawyer when he offers her a chance to get even.</description>

  <description>Discovering your ex is a serial-killing religious zealot would put anyone off dating for a good long while. That’s where Hudson “Taco” Vines’s head is at when he meets Koren, a woman who looks a little too much like his ex for comfort. But he can’t deny their attraction, and the more he gets to know her, the more Taco realizes how different Koren is from his ex, in all the best ways. It’s not long before he’s feeling things for her that he’s never felt for anyone, ever. After the drama of his last relationship, maybe this is his reward…a supportive, comfortable life with a woman he’s coming to love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koren Garner is no fan of drama, and it certainly seems Taco and his friends have all seen more than their share. So you’d think meeting him for the second time at the scene of her own car accident would be enough to warn her away. But Koren can’t resist the sexy firefighter. A little drama might be worth the risk…even when an unknown threat starts targeting Taco’s friends. Someone’s setting fires, and the danger’s escalating with each blaze. Koren and Taco can only pray the culprit is caught before their relationship—and their lives—go up in smoke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Koren is the 14th book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Freak. Witch. Ugly. Abomination.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having grown up with a port-wine birthmark on her face and neck, Quinn Dixon’s heard them all. Her own mother couldn’t bear to touch her, let alone strangers. Years of stares and insults from everyone from classmates to foster families have made her understandably reluctant to trust. So when John comes along, of course he couldn’t be interested in more than a brief affair. He’ll get sick of all the gawking and whispers soon enough and leave her…just like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John “Driftwood” Trettle was captivated by Quinn the moment they met. After months of skirting around their attraction, one pivotal evening finds John seizing the reins and refusing to be denied a chance to prove he’s worthy of Quinn’s time, her trust, and her love. To show her he’ll have her back, always, and defend her against anyone cruel or stupid enough to hurt his woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he can’t protect against an unknown threat. Even if it wears a familiar face…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Quinn is the 13th book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</description>

  <description>He thought he’d lost his chance to be with her. Now, he'll move Heaven and Earth to keep her safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a former SEAL and now Alpha Team’s technical analyst, Derek West is all about the numbers. But, when this Texas native unexpectedly bumps into the one that got away, he’s determined to beat the odds. Derek wants to make Charlie a part of his life again—especially when he discovers she’s been living with a monster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To others, Charlotte “Charlie” Porter’s elaborate life seems picture-perfect, but then no one truly knows what goes on behind closed doors. After a chance meeting with the one man she’s never been able to forget, Charlie begins to dream of the road not taken. Unfortunately for them both, it’s a road that could prove lethal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Derek shows up just when she needs him most, Charlie finally breaks loose from her abusive husband’s clutches. But as she and Derek begin to explore what could’ve been, these friends-to-lovers realize Charlie’s in more danger than ever before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Derek be able to keep the love of his life safe, or will an obsessive killer destroy the second chance both he and Charlie have always dreamed of? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Intentional Risk is Book 4 in the R.I.S.C. Series. It can be read as a standalone. However, there are characters from and references to the previous three books, so you may want to start with Book 1--Taking a Risk, Part One--to avoid any spoilers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**All R.I.S.C. novels are full-length and filled with hot romance, loads of action, and edge-of-your-seat suspense. Every R.I.S.C. member will get their own Happily Ever After...of course, they'll have to fight for it, first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;R.I.S.C. Series in order: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Taking a Risk, Part One (Jake &amp;amp; Olivia's HFN) &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Taking a Risk, Part Two (Jake &amp;amp; Olivia's HEA) &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Beautiful Risk (Trevor &amp;amp; Lexi) &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Intentional Risk (Derek &amp;amp; Charlotte "Charlie") &lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Unpredictable Risk (Grant &amp;amp; Brynnon) Coming Soon &lt;br /&gt;Book 6: TBD &lt;br /&gt;Book 7: TBD &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bravo Team Series: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This spin-off series will follow the stories of each member of R.I.S.C.'s new Bravo Team and will be available to either purchase through Amazon or read through KU.

It builds at a steady pace and is quite suspenseful, even slightly edgy at times. The characters were easy to love and seemed a great fit for each other, Taylor being...]]>

  <description>Fortis and Purgatory are both exceptional covert agencies composed of deadly operatives. With the Atlantic Ocean between them, they never thought they would ever collaborate until a series of horrible murders force them to unite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former Navy SEAL, Shane Rhodes has suffered his share of tragedies but when his best friend’s little sister is murdered by a vicious serial killer, he takes it personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emme Wallace is the perfect bait; she is also young, innocent and skilled. &lt;br /&gt;With both their teams behind them, they go after a lethal shadow set on revenge. &lt;br /&gt;As danger brings them even closer, barriers are shattered and bonds formed until they realise that they are much stronger together than they are apart. &lt;br /&gt;But will their unique talents and skills be enough to survive a threat no one can see?</description>

  <description>Calvin Blake—He has a body that makes women fall to their knees, a smile that promises forbidden pleasure—but only for one night. He makes no promises to the women who share his bed, except that they will leave it satiated and exhausted. His enemies underestimate him, which is their first mistake. Their second is turning their backs on the lethal danger harnessed inside him. He allows no one inside his head or his heart. Not his team members at Eidolon, not his enemies, not the willing women who warm his bed. Until her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Paxton—Her smile makes men want to unravel the mystery of the beautiful yet elusive woman. They crave the feel of her skin, the taste of her lips. However, her smile hides a secret. She’s the heiress to a multimillion-dollar fortune. She’s also a member of Zenobi, the group of female assassins trying to right wrongs done against women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake is shocked when Pax comes to him, asking for help to prove her father is a murderer. She’s asking for the one thing he can’t give her. Blake walks away until someone makes it personal. Then he makes it his mission to bring down the multibillionaire. As they work together, emotions and feelings they thought buried rise to the surface and they discover that sometimes your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the body count rising, Blake and Pax must survive and find the truth before it’s too late. Otherwise, their future together will be over before it begins.</description>

  <description>A woman who stands alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the leader of Zenobi, a deadly group of female assassins, Roz Maklavoi is feared and revered in equal measure. Hiding behind her impenetrable wall of ice is a young girl who was tortured and beaten, sold to evil by the one man she should have been able to trust.&lt;br /&gt;Now the man responsible for her torture has struck again, targeting her loved ones. Knowing she can’t allow anyone else she loves to become a victim of her ‘husband’, Roz embarks on a solo mission which will probably end her life. But dying doesn’t frighten her, living does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lone wolf who embraces the darkness within.&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years ago, as a young soldier, MI6 officer Kanan ‘K’ Phillips fell in love with a broken young woman. Watching from afar as she fought to become the strong, fearless leader of Zenobi, knowing that she would never remember him, even though he’d never forgotten her. &lt;br /&gt;A chance meeting on a beach allowed them to spend two blissful months together as strangers until one night she disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Now they have been thrown together again, and Kanan vows to protect his Kitten with his life. He must thaw the ice around her heart, without getting his own broken again. &lt;br /&gt;Will he make her see or will he die trying?</description>

  <description>He will stop at nothing to keep those he loves safe!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack Cunningham is the sexy, brooding leader of the Fortis team. He has spent most of his life fighting evil, first as an elite SAS operative, and now running Fortis, a group comprised of ex-special ops men and woman.&lt;br /&gt;Now he faces the biggest fight of his life. He must keep the woman who has haunted his dreams safe while he leads his team against the sick and twisted Divine Watchers.&lt;br /&gt;With trusts broken and relationships betrayed, can he convince the woman who haunts him that he is worth a chance or will he die trying?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ava Drake has spent her life living in a man’s world, and she knows she is strong enough to go it alone. She now must decide if that is living or is risking her heart and that of her sons a risk worth taking. Does she stand and fight for what she wants and needs from the only man she has ever loved or does she run and keep her heart safe but dead?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack and Ava must decide if they want to fight for what they want or if it’s just too big a risk to take.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Hathaway House, a heartwarming military romance series from USA TODAY best-selling author Dale Mayer. Here you’ll meet a whole new group of friends, along with a few favorite characters from Heroes for Hire. Instead of action, you’ll find emotion. Instead of suspense, you’ll find healing. Instead of romance, … oh, wait. … There is romance—of course! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Welcome to Hathaway House. Rehab Center. Safe Haven. Second chance at life and love. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Finn MacGregor arrives at Hathaway House not only with half of one leg but with a stoma, one that necessitates the use of a colostomy bag. While it’s nice to once again see his old friend Dani Hathaway and her father, the Major, it’s tough to feel like the least sexy man on the face of the earth. Especially after he meets the pretty nurse in charge of his care … &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Fiona Smithers has seen practically everything when it comes to the human body, and Finn’s physical problems don’t faze her. Emotionally she’s wary though. Once before, one of her patients had confused the gratitude he felt for her as love. … That scenario left Fiona devastated to know her friendliness had been misunderstood. Whether deemed love or friendliness, those emotions directly effected that patient’s initial healing and then his setbacks of body as well as of heart and of mind, making her more determined not to run the same risks again. Yet, this time, she may not be able to help herself. She wants Finn in her life on a permanent basis, but, after seeing his obsession with her in his artwork, is that even possible?</description>

  <description>When club enforcer Wrath is asked for help, he is torn between doing what’s right and stirring up a past that still haunts him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a journey that forces him to question and re-evaluate everything he thought he already knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decisions have to be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should he continue on the path he’s chosen or is there a chance of becoming the man his mother would have wanted him to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life doesn’t always have a happy ever after, no matter how much you want it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a heart-wrenching tale of heartbreak and loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, it will leave your emotions in tatters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: Lavinia Urban had a vision to write this series, yet her life was taken from her all too soon after a heart-wrenching battle with Metastatic Breast Cancer. Aside from her family’s welfare, her last wish was for her friends to continue these stories about The Seven Deadly Sins. With her husband’s well wishes, seven authors banded together to bring Lavinia Urban’s Seven Deadly Sins Series to her fans and readers everywhere. All proceeds will go to Lavinia’s loving husband and adorable children. May she rest in peace with the knowledge we will never forget her.</description>

  <description>When a handsome WWII, American pilot called Teddy stepped into the local corner shop in search of candy, sweet and unassuming Jenny’s world went from boring to breath-taking. But with war threatening to put an end to their budding romance, there time together became precious, forcing them to live for the moment.Was she just another stupid girl who had got taken in by a good-looking GI?1940’s Historical Romance with Heat. Contains language and descriptive scenes that are only suitable for the over eighteen/adult reader.This WW2 historical romance originally appeared in the Help Our Heroes Charity Anothology in May 2018, which is now no longer available. When it was released back to me, I decided to switch it to duel perspective and extended it. So, if you’ve already read it as a short, please don’t skip the beginning. Re-read from the start. It’s the perfect chance to get to know the characters a little better and find out what happened to this charismatic couple.</description>

      <![CDATA[Romantic love story that doesn't go quite as smoothly as it should, obstacles including the war interrupt and cause problems and grief. Intense and emotional read but gripping and happily ever after as any true romance should be. Fast flow and well written.]]>

  <description>Secret lives. &lt;br /&gt;He knows all about those. &lt;br /&gt;She's just now learning the ropes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jack Carpenter's family thinks he's a high flyer on the London stock market, but that's far from the truth. Illegal, bare-knuckle fighting earns him a comfortable lifestyle--almost too comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a notorious gangster can't pay what he owes, he gives Jack an offer he can't refuse: ninety days with any woman of his choice, until the bet is paid off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night and one tragic accident later, Lily Green's perfect life ends. Suddenly, her father's double life implodes into her own. Not only was her father a criminal, but his debts are now hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the only thing she has to offer, is herself. Lily becomes the consolation prize for a man whose very existence is everything she detests. Incidentally, that same man is also the first man she ever let touch her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ninety days of undeniable passion... will either of them be able to resist? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Army veteran, ex-cop, and brother of the Bayou Devils MC, Wyatt Landry is a man on a mission. He’s always wanted a family, but after being blindsided and betrayed by his ex-wife, Piper, he’s hesitant to try again… until now. He’s done letting the woman who abandoned him years ago control his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Landry knows a thing or two about trauma and she has the emotional scars to prove it. In a moment of weakness, she made the biggest mistake of her life, walking away from her husband and the love they shared. It haunts her every day, but she's trying to move forward and build a life without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fate brings Wyatt and Piper together again, sparks fly and old wounds are torn open, leaving them stranded in a minefield of secrets and lies. But the issues between them aren’t the only thing standing in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they get over the pain of their past and build a future together? Or will forces beyond their control rip them apart again?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; One protective alpha male plus one curvy damsel in distress equals an instant attraction they can’t deny. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Billionaire nightclub owner Jason Dare doesn’t stand a chance. From the moment he lays eyes on the luscious blonde stuck on the side of the road and realizes she’s in danger, he goes from playboy to bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faith Lancaster’s sweet body won’t come to any harm on his watch. And watch Faith he does. He can’t take his eyes off her. Jason will stop at nothing to keep Faith safe.

  <description>Head of security for a prominent American family, John Edwards is the epitome of the strong, silent type. With an all-work, no-play attitude, he guards his heart as fiercely as he protects his clients. John only allows himself casual fun with easy women, punishing himself for a past he can't redeem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when he meets Jasmin Carpenter, all bets are off. Suddenly, John is falling for the flighty and flirty British girl. Quickly marrying her under the guise of her safety, he's determined to make this sham of a marriage stick. While Jasmin desperately yearns for the security of marriage and the lure of unconditional love, she knows she can never give John what he deserves. Now, he must convince Jasmin that they are destined to be together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He doesn't want more. &lt;br /&gt;He wants everything, &lt;br /&gt;Despite the irrevocable damage their pasts have created...</description>

  <description>When naive, British physiotherapist, Frankie Jones, is offered the job of a lifetime, she decides letting go of her grief and moving on is exactly what the doctor ordered. But when she comes face to face with a sexy and irresistible blast from her past, she realises that this time she just can't walk away.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if it means stirring up old memories and pain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Assertive and controlling CEO, Alex Blackmore, is shackled to obligations--obligations he didn't necessarily want. But now that Frankie is back in his life, he knows exactly what he does want--and will have. As their relationship intensifies, Alex's worlds collide and their past resurfaces, threatening to destroy what they're both working toward--letting go and moving on. Can Frankie and Alex fight their demons and embrace the future they're FATED for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is recommended for over 18's only, due to HOT content!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This Time, More Than Their Love Is On The Line&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Navy SEAL Commander, Liam McAllister, was neck deep in the Mexican jungle on a contract assignment for a highly classified sub-set of Department of Homeland Security. When Liam discovers a conspiracy that goes deep and spans decades it makes him sick. He asks his mentor at the DHS to provide him an intelligence liaison with Naval experience to help him ensure justice is served. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam was stunned when Addison Sanders walked through the door. She was a blast from the past and a punch to gut, a woman he’d loved and lost. But this buttoned up Addison was a shadow of her former self. He'd hardly recognized her but nothing could disguise her intelligence and heart, and Liam quickly finds old flames reignited. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her help, Liam and his team start to close in on the dirty forces who are intent on covering up decades of crimes. They soon realized the corruption reached farther than anyone could’ve imagined and it isn’t over. Now Addison is a target. When the clock starts ticking, Liam risks everything to make sure that Addison is protected. Will they finally have a chance on the future they lost out on before? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don't miss out on all of the fantastic books in the Silver SEALs Series: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SILVER SEALS &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Strong (Silver SEALs Prequel) Cat Johnson &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Love's Legacy (Silver SEALs Book 1) Sharon Hamilton &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Together (Silver SEALs Book 2) Maryann Jordan &lt;br /&gt;SEAL of Fortune (Silver SEALs Book 3) Becky McGraw &lt;br /&gt;SEAL in Charge (Silver SEALs Book 4) Donna Michaels &lt;br /&gt;SEAL in a Storm (Silver SEALs Book 5) KaLyn Cooper &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Forever (Silver SEALs Book 6) Kris Michaels &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Out of Water (Silver SEALs Book 7) Abbie Zanders &lt;br /&gt;Sign, SEAL and Deliver (Silver SEALs Book 8) Geri Foster &lt;br /&gt;SEAL Hard (Silver SEALs Book 9) J.M.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To save his family empire from the grip of the drug cartel, Shane is pushed to the edge of darkness, forced to make choices he might never make. His father is dying. His brother is desperate to rule the empire and this means war and all gloves are off. His brother only thought he knew what dirty meant. Shane is about to give it new meaning. There is another war brewing though, and that one, is inside him, his battle between right and wrong, light and dark, and in the heat of the night, it is Emily he turns to for escape. Driving her to new limits, pushing her to accept a part of him that even he cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every one of Shane's seductive demands, Emily can taste and feel, his torment, his struggle to save his family and not lose himself. But he is losing himself, and that is a problem just as dangerous as her secret, that still lurk in the shadows, a threat to the Brandon Family waiting to erupt. No matter where she and Shane have traveled, or will travel in the future, she can't just sit back and watch him become everything he hates, everything he never wanted to become, everything she tried to save him from when she tried to run. It could be their undoing, the end. His end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is war, blood will spill, and someone in the heart of the Brandon family will not survive...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to play by the hard rules of the Brandon family empire? Check out the other compelling novels in the Dirty Money series: &lt;i&gt;Hard Rules &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Damage Control.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wall Street&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Sons of Anarchy&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Hard Rules&lt;/i&gt;, the smouldering, scorching first novel in the explosively sexy &lt;i&gt;Dirty Money&lt;/i&gt; series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Lisa Renee Jones, author of the&lt;i&gt; Inside Out&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;How bad do you want it? &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only man within the Brandon empire with a moral compass, Shane Brandon is ready to take his family's business dealings legitimate. His reckless and ruthless brother, Derek wants to keep Brandon Enterprises cemented in lies, deceit and corruption. But the harder Shane fights to pull the company back into the light, the darker he has to become. Then he meets Emily Stevens, a woman who not only stirs a voracious sexual need in him, but becomes the only thing anchoring him between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily is consumed by Shane, pushed sexually in ways she never dreamed of, falling deeper into the all-encompassing passion that is this man. She trusts him. He trusts her, but therein lies the danger. Emily has a secret, the very thing that brought her to him in the first place, and that secret could destroy them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is book ONE of FOUR in Shane and Emily's story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love, Cass is a heart wrenching story about life, love, and loss. Loosely based on true life events of Author Stephanie St. Klaire, Cass is a relatable story guaranteed to make you look at life through a different lens. In this emotionally charged roller coaster of events, Cass represents life in fiction as she achieves triumph over tragedy, even in death. Stephanie shares her inspirational tale of victory with symbolic representation as she says goodbye to the girl she once was...through Cass.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As requested by Brother’s Keeper fans, here is the companion novel for Liam...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s something they don’t tell you about fairy tales. Happily ever after isn’t promised. Happy &lt;i&gt;forever&lt;/i&gt;? Now, that’s a thing…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I met my Prince Charming right out of pigtails and just before that point where boys stop being icky, and they just smell bad. Before I knew it, we went from best friends growing up to a whirlwind romance full of dream come trues. We were planning a forever that every love-soaked romance novel tries to recreate. I was living the ultimate romantic love story – skipped the frog phase and went straight to full blown prince. My life was perfect - until it wasn’t... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m dying.&lt;/i&gt; The fairy tale just changed a bit, didn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can’t leave until those left behind know how to live their happy forever…&lt;i&gt;without me&lt;/i&gt;. I won’t get the forever with them, but they’ll get a forever with me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m Cassidy O’Reilly…and this is my story.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;I fled my palace home to escape an unwanted marriage and stumbled into the arms of five potential mates. Yes, five.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One fanged genie, four badass bandits, and a plus-one princess—me—forced together in an unconventional relationship that will save our world and yours, if we can figure out how to work together &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; fall in love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s a pretty big if. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should probably mention, there are a few added obstacles, standing in the way of my save-the-world success: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt; My father’s snake-taming sidekick and seer put a bounty on my head. Avoiding his dark riders and the brutal pirates that roam the desert is no easy task. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; I don’t know how to charge my mom’s magic carpet. Did I mention I suck at magic? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; My companion, a sand cat, is missing and may be dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.&lt;/b&gt; A supposed friend sold me to one of the above mentioned pirates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; I refuse to be bullied into a relationship no matter how tempting my new suitors are. These five protective and deliciously different alpha males may have claimed me, but I get to choose my fate, ancient prophecy or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re betting on my success, take notes.&lt;/b&gt; I’ve lived a sheltered life inside a pristine palace, until now. So you might want to settle your affairs because I can’t guarantee I’ll beat the bad guys. But if my wannabe mates have their way, you should be good to plan your next vacation, wedding…meal. Choose wisely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ll do the same. Promise.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Finding Jaslynn&lt;/i&gt; is a fairy tale retelling reminiscent of Aladdin and The Arabian Nights. It is for readers 18 and older due to language, adult themes and sexual situations. There are events that could be considered triggers for some readers. Despite the dark fantasy elements, you can expect humor, no cheating, and a happily ever after. For those new to the genre, this is a “Why Choose” Romance, often referred to as Reverse Harem Romance. This is the first volume of a book duet (two book series). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Beware! There is a cliffhanger, but book two Saving Jaslynn will come fast and is up for pre-order now. HEA is coming!</description>

  <description>The Matchmaker’s Curse says if the mutant accepts the match, then his fated mate must die. If he doesn’t accept it, then he must die… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one has yet survived the curse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The threat coming for Selena Irving has been stalking her family for years, ruining her parents’ lives and pushing her onto the warrior’s path. She’s the only female yet to qualify for the elite dark ops unit in the Army called the Red Team, and while that shielded her for a little while, the nightmare’s begun again. Now she’s caught the eye of an alpha male with super powers—her definition of trouble. Sexy-as-hell Bastion loves easily, laughs often, and cooks like a master chef. He’s also the only man to see through her defenses to the person she used to be…the woman she might have become had her past been different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bastion, changed against his will into a mutant warrior, is on a mission to find those responsible for stealing his life, intent on stopping their plans to unravel humanity. He wasn’t looking for a mate, but he bonds with Selena the first time he sees her, activating a curse neither of them can escape. His only chance to break it is to ruthlessly burrow into her secrets, forcing her to face her hidden scars, helping her heal before the danger headed her way can use her past to take her down—and everyone she loves with her. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s not a robot. He’s not a human. He’s both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liege, changed against his will into a super soldier by nanotechnology, is driven to protect humanity from the evil intent of his enemies. But the deadly focus he was wired for comes to a crashing halt when he sees her, a female who ignites in him a very human hunger, one he no longer thought himself capable of feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Coltrane is oblivious to the powers swirling around her--light and dark, evil and good--until the veil between both worlds is ripped open and she’s plunged into a terrible power play between a darkly tempting warrior and his ruthless enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To stay alive, she must join forces with Liege, a man who kills without remorse to save those he loves in a war no one in her world can know about.</description>

  <description>Can he forgive himself in time to save the woman he loves? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Delta Force operator, Trevor Matthews, has spent years trying to move on from the sins of his past. Nearly a decade later, he’s still haunted by the deaths of his teammates and the woman he cared deeply for. Then, he meets Lexi—the beautiful waitress with an angelic smile—and almost instantly, his soul sparks back to life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lexi Hamilton was well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a world-class chef when tragedy strikes. After losing everything that mattered to her, she has no other choice but to spend her days waiting tables and praying for tips. Busy clawing her way back to the life she aspires to have, the last thing Lexi expects is to fall in love. That all changes the moment she meets Trevor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the hunky private security expert protects her from a dangerous situation, they immediately form an unbreakable connection. But just as Trevor decides he’s ready to give love another try, he realizes someone wants Lexi dead. Can Trevor fight off his own demons in time to save the woman he loves, or will the ghosts from his past cost him everything? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Risk is a stand-alone romantic suspense with a sweet, burning love story and plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you like hot, alpha men who will risk everything to protect the women they love, buy this book—the third in the new R.I.S.C. Series—today! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>R.I.S.C. (Rescue, Intel, Security, &amp;amp; Capture): An elite, private security team who will stop at nothing to protect the ones they love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The highly anticipated romantic suspense series by debut author, Anna Blakely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;HE LIED TO PROTECT HER &lt;br /&gt;It’s been two months since Jake McQueen walked away from the woman he loves. With the other members of R.I.S.C.’s Alpha Team by his side, Jake left to ensure Olivia’s safety. Now that he’s back, he’s ready to take their relationship to the next level. Before he can do that, Jake will have to confess his greatest sin. All he's ever wanted was to keep Olivia safe, but Jake fears his need to protect will end up pushing her away from him forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DANGER’S CLOSER THAN SHE THINKS &lt;br /&gt;To Olivia, forgiving Jake for leaving the way he did seems impossible. When he shows up unexpectedly and explains what happened, she realizes she has no choice but to let him off the hook. Now closer than ever, Olivia’s just starting to believe they have a future when Jake confesses to a decade-long secret that turns her world upside down. To make matters worse, Olivia has no idea that someone is watching her, just waiting for the perfect chance to end her life…for good, this time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Taking a Risk, Part Two brings you Jake and Olivia’s Happily Ever After. Though it can be read as a stand-alone, I recommend you read Taking a Risk, Part One first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***These are the only books in this series that have a two-part storyline. The other novels will each be standalones, with characters from the previous books popping up here and there within the different stories.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Hathaway House, a heartwarming military romance series from USA TODAY best-selling author Dale Mayer. Here you’ll meet a whole new group of friends, along with a few favorite characters from Heroes for Hire. Instead of action, you’ll find emotion. Instead of suspense, you’ll find healing. Instead of romance, … oh, wait. … There is romance—of course! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Hathaway House. Rehab Center. Safe Haven. Second chance at life and love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Denton Hamilton has checked himself into Hathaway House, hoping for a fraction of the results his friends have gotten at the rehab center. Now missing a rib, muscles and a portion of his stomach, as well as suffering from PTSD, Denton would be happy to have his physical self healed. He’s not so sure he’ll ever get his mental health back, and finding a woman who’ll have him now—as his friends have been lucky enough to do—is out of the question. Who would be willing to love a man like him? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Administrative Assistant Hannah Forsythe helps Dani run Hathaway House. A loner at heart, she’s drawn to Denton’s struggle and dismayed at his belief that no one could ever love him. But when an ill-advised observation she makes has unexpected consequences for Denton’s recovery, Hannah’s only choice is to separate herself from him to help him progress without her. &lt;br /&gt;As time passes, Hannah wonders if her choice has cost her everything she’s ever wanted or whether Denton can work through his feelings to give them both their happy ending at Hathaway House.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was hired to hunt her down. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Navy SEAL Commander Ryan Marchetti hates the fancy consulting job he’s taken after retirement from the Teams. So when the Assistant Director of the DHS offers him a contract to hunt down an assassin, he leaps at the chance, even if it means hunting down his former lover. He must focus on the mission and ignore Sutton McRaven’s sharp wit and way-too-sexy body, and bring the only woman he’s ever loved to justice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She wasn’t ready to be caught. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CIA Agent Sutton McRaven found the life she’d always wanted in the CIA, one filled with adventure, and doing what’s best for the country she loves. But after her best friend dies, she finds herself anchorless and longing for a home. When she receives a mysterious call, Sutton investigates, only to discover another friend murdered, and all evidence marking her as the killer. She needs to stay free to clear her name and find justice, but Ryan Marchetti, a man used to tracking high profile targets has set his sights on her. Sutton must use all her knowledge to escape and evade the man who’d once captured, and then rejected, her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But only together would they survive. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Ryan closes in on Sutton, the real killer is still free, and Sutton’s the next target. The chase becomes darker and deadlier, with stakes higher than either could have imagined. Stalked by a ruthless killer, the two must learn to trust each other, or end up dying alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SEAL for Hire&lt;/i&gt; is a stand-alone military romantic suspense with a second chance romance and enough thrills to keep your heart pounding.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Love this, finally all couples in a good place and the Ravage family is celebrating. This book is all about the romance and I relished every bit of it, though short there is something from most of my favourites from this next generation of Ravage.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A small job. That's all it's supposed to be.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get in. Get the information. Get out unseen.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, right? Not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hacker. Thief. Rebel. Lethal. &lt;/b&gt;At least that's what people say about me and they're right.&lt;br /&gt;Holding other's lives in the palm of my hand is an i&lt;b&gt;ncredible power.&lt;/b&gt; One necessary to keep &lt;b&gt;order and control&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walls around me are built &lt;b&gt;strong&lt;/b&gt;, but not strong enough for one man. A man who was a &lt;b&gt;friend&lt;/b&gt; then turned into a &lt;b&gt;lover&lt;/b&gt;. Someone I should've &lt;b&gt;never tangled my life with&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong Way is a member of the &lt;b&gt;Ravage Motorcycle Club Rebellion chapter&lt;/b&gt;, known throughout the town as ruthless, all &lt;b&gt;alpha bad boy biker&lt;/b&gt; and my next job. Therefore, strictly &lt;b&gt;forbidden&lt;/b&gt;, but especially so now because we're &lt;b&gt;enemies&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's &lt;b&gt;arrogant, brash&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;keen, knowledgeable &lt;/b&gt;about everything around him. Flying under his radar isn't easy. Therefore, hacking the &lt;b&gt;MC's&lt;/b&gt; system takes finesse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my client doesn't get the information, my best friend will die. If I succeed and leave even a single trace of a digital footprint, Wrong Way will find it and with their &lt;b&gt;family loyalty,&lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt;Ravage MC&lt;/b&gt; will kill me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every way, I run through the scenario, someone is going to lose. This time the power is out of my control and I have to find some way to stop it. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for the Rebellion Series:&lt;br /&gt;~ ... &lt;b&gt;sexy, intense, suspenseful, dangerous, twisted, gritty, raw, passionate, undeniable, and completely unforgettable&lt;/b&gt; ... -Brianna&lt;br /&gt;~ ... &lt;b&gt;angst, heartache, secrets, action, some really hot scenes,&lt;/b&gt; and enough &lt;b&gt;suspense&lt;/b&gt; to keep you right on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. -Janna&lt;br /&gt;~ ... it had &lt;b&gt;suspense, drama, action&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;twists&lt;/b&gt;. The book will keep you on the edge of your seat. The &lt;b&gt;connection&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;chemistry&lt;/b&gt; between the couple was strong and sexy. -Dani&lt;br /&gt;~Ravage Rebellion had a real &lt;b&gt;Kristen Ashley &lt;/b&gt;feel to me. -PGsky&lt;br /&gt;~Oh how I wish I could give this &lt;b&gt;book more than 5 stars&lt;/b&gt;! This book left my &lt;b&gt;emotions raw&lt;/b&gt; and a book hangover that just won't quit! -Stephanie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ravage MC Series&lt;/b&gt; reading order:&lt;br /&gt;Ravage Me (Cruz &amp;amp; Princess)&lt;br /&gt;Seduce Me (GT &amp;amp; Casey)&lt;br /&gt;Consume Me (Tug &amp;amp; Blaze)&lt;br /&gt;Inflame Me (Rhys &amp;amp; Tanner)&lt;br /&gt;Captivate Me (Buzz &amp;amp; Bella - Breaker &amp;amp; Shania)&lt;br /&gt;Ride with Me (co-written with Chelsea Camaron)&lt;br /&gt;The Ravage MC Novella Collection (Satisfy Me, Rattle Me, Final Ravage MC Epilogue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ravage MC Bound Series&lt;/b&gt; (Second Generation) reading order:&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Family (Cooper &amp;amp; Bristyl)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Desire (Deke &amp;amp; Rylie)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Vengeance (Ryker &amp;amp; Austyn)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Affliction (Green &amp;amp; Leah)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Destiny (Emery &amp;amp; Jacks &amp;amp; Micah)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Wreckage (Nox &amp;amp; Carsyn)&lt;br /&gt;Bound by Destruction (Coming Soon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ravage MC Rebellion Series&lt;/b&gt; reading order:&lt;br /&gt;Connected in Pain (Crow &amp;amp; Rylynn)&lt;br /&gt;Fueled in Fire (Crow &amp;amp; Rylynn)&lt;br /&gt;Sealed in Strength (Crow &amp;amp; Rylynn)&amp;amp;lt&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Nothing is what it seems … ever …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nelson’s early morning meeting at the docks with Elizabeth Etchings offers only bad news. Her brother—and Nelson’s old friend—has gone missing on his days off while his ship was docked in Ensenada. A trip to where he’d last been seen shows the local color … and reveals Nelson’s friend has gotten into bigger trouble than anyone could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth might have had a hand in now sending two men to Baja to look for her brother, but she will not stay behind. Her brother is in danger … and he’s the only family she has left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t take long for Nelson to realize that Elizabeth has caught the eye of someone who rules that corner of the world. She’s now in jeopardy too—possibly more than her brother. Keeping her safe moves up Nelson’s priority list.&lt;br /&gt;Until both issues merge, and everything goes south …</description>

  <description>Dr. Anais Kenly and her twin sister Anya are on the run, forced to flee their comfortable lives in North Carolina and go to ground all the way to across the country in California. So why, when it’s so important to stay under the radar, do they keep jumping from the frying pan into the fire? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chief Petty Officer Kijika “Shadow” Gibson can’t believe his eyes when he sees the news footage of the two pretty women freed from a bank hostage situation. Despite his best efforts, the determined bachelor hasn’t stopped thinking about gentle Anais since meeting the twins during a top secret mission with his SEAL team. And now, here she is again. Of all the luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anais and Anya are used to looking out for each other, but they’re no match for the killer on their trail. When the bullets start flying, Anais knows Shadow is exactly the warrior they need to keep them safe. Even if it means opening her fragile heart to a man determined to keep his safely locked away.</description>

      <![CDATA[Tense read from the offset, with lots of suspense and build up. A little bit angsty at first but that smoothes out as the threat builds, a few twists to keep it interesting and a bit edgy. I liked this couple, I think they were well suited with just enough differences to make it work between them...]]>

  <description>***This book was previously published in Amazon Kindle Worlds*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jackson Langley, better known as Bear, felt like his team was family and he rarely thought of marriage. At least not until he rescued Kayla Townsend in the parking lot outside Ace’s Bar and Grill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kayla secretly longed to meet Jackson, but her distrust of men kept her away from him. After he rescues her, she relaxes her guard and they spend one night of passion which leads to more. Kayla’s old fears of distrust returns when Jackson doesn’t call her after their time together. She fears it’s over and then an unexpected pregnancy changes everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jackson returns and danger stalks Kayla, Jackson will do anything to keep her and their unborn child safe. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Fast paced suspenseful read that also has a fast relationship, can't call it romance as such as they don't have much time for dates or build up. This is all in pretty much from the start with threats and some action along the way, characters that are easy to like. I also enjoyed that minor squabb...]]>

  <description>Max DiSalvo gave his entire life to the SEALs. He would have married—he certainly enjoyed women—but he never could find one who understood his dedication to the Teams, even though many of his team members married happily. It takes a certain caliber of woman to be a SEAL wife and Max just never found one that fit with him. Now, at 48, he is out of the SEALs, running his own commercial fishing company in Maine where he grew up, and waiting for his assignments from DHS. &lt;br /&gt;Regan Shaw, a SEAL widow, is an Intelligence Operations Specialist with DHS, and a woman who Max is drawn to from first sight. Part of her job is analyzing information to assess threats and she’s discovered a doozy—there is a secret group of very wealthy people who, in partnership with a powerful cartel, are using the border with Mexico to smuggle terrorists from the Middle East into the country. And word has come down that a high level member of the government is clearing the way with them for everything. &lt;br /&gt;The group is about to have one of its executive meetings at an exclusive resort in Texas and that’s where DHS is sending the two of them. Credentials have been arranged that would make him attractive to the group. A story has been set and there is backup for him should he need it. Regan, who has all the information on this operation, will go with him as his wife. &lt;br /&gt;As they uncover more and more of the operation, they realize just how dangerous this group really is. When someone betrays them, and Regan is kidnapped, Max goes into war mode, because in Regan Shaw he’s found the woman he’s waited for all his life and he doesn’t intend to lose her now. But he will need every bit of the skills that he learned as a SEAL to rescue her and bring down this very dirty conspiracy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Full of intrigue and suspense this is a fast paced read that certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. The conclusion was a bit quick and easy after all the build up but not enough to disappoint to much, the characters were an even match for each other. The plot a scary scenario and one I'd hate...]]>

  <description>Kray and North are like a unit, where there's one, there's the other. When the both of them take a case involving a missing agent, they become more involved than they bargained for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vienna is willing to do anything to find her sister and bring her home safe. Anything except shacking up with the two bikers who are dead set on solving this case. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Vienna be the first one who will drive a wedge between two bikers who have been a solid team for over twelve years? Or will either one's attention be too clouded to save lives while bringing a network of criminals to justice? Life or death, live or love. Making a choice never comes easily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The complete Broken Deeds MC series can be read together or separately. Each book in the Broken Deeds MC series is a complete standalone story featuring a new couple. &lt;br /&gt;Except for Kray and North. They are like a unit, where there's one, there's the other.

      <![CDATA[Though only a short prequel there's enough to get you hooked and wanting more, there's a hot scene to get the blood pumping and give a clue of more to come and it ends with the lead into the main story. I have a feeling I'm going to want to be left completely alone to get lost in that when I can....]]>

  &lt;strong&gt;Lizzie has decided that single life does not suit her.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <![CDATA[I loved this story, it's down to earth and honest warts and all. Thankfully even though I'm in the age bracket I don't have the weak bladder but do have the bingo wings lol. This is funny but also a bit sad in places, I really felt for Lizzie at times, all she wanted was honesty and straight talk...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One plus size woman who wants to have a child via artificial insemination because her biological clock is ticking. One reclusive billionaire who is more than willing to give her the kid she wants...the natural way. Two people who might very well discover that what they'd wanted at the beginning of their relationship isn't what they'd really needed at all!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have everything I've always wanted. A successful career as a plus-size model, a new business that's flourishing, financial security, and amazing friends who I know will always have my back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So everything should be perfect in my world, right? I should be content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I'm not. I want to have a child, and my biological clock is ticking way too loudly for my liking. Since every man I'd ever dated was a jerk, I was okay with not having a man in my life. I'd already decided I was better off without one. Problem was, I did need a baby daddy, so my only solution was to find a sperm donor, and I was ready to do exactly that at a fertility clinic...until a very unlikely source, billionaire Mason Lawson, offers to knock me up the natural way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, really? How can a woman who wants to have a child not consider Mason's offer? The man was every woman's fantasy, including mine. I can't even look at him without wanting to tear his clothes off and find out what's underneath that cool, businesslike, billionaire facade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, I just don't understand his motives. Why would he want to have an intimate relationship with a plus size woman like me? Not that I wouldn't love to dip into his "gene pool," but why in the world does he want to be the father of my child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't about to accept his offer. There would be way too many complications, but I'm still intrigued by the man who put that option out there in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did he do it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody like Mason is the man a woman really wants, but can never have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's the unattainable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, as Mason starts a sensual game of seduction with me, I'm finding it almost impossible to resist the urge to play with him, even if it's only for a little while...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. ... Controlling to chaos. ... But murder ... not this time!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night 10 years ago, 8-year-old Crystal, vanished from her bed in her parents’ house, the only clue a footprint in the flowerbed below the girl’s window. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that footprint’s reappeared, this time at the scene of another crime, and Doreen is under strict orders not to stick her nose into Corporal Mack Moreau’s new investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Mack is busy with the new case, Doreen figures it can’t hurt if she just takes a quick look at the old one. Her house is empty, her antiques removed, and she has time on her hands. She’s finished working on Penny’s garden and needs a new project to keep her busy – and allow her to avoid the heavy work waiting in her own garden. And with the help of her assistants, Thaddeus the parrot, Goliath the Maine Coon, and Mugs the Basset, soon Doreen is busy navigating the world of pawn shops and blackmail as she looks for clues as to what happened to the girl stolen from her bedroom so many years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely, it’s not her fault when her case butts up against the new one – is it?</description>

  <description>Welcome to Hathaway House, a heartwarming military romance series from USA TODAY best-selling author Dale Mayer. Here you’ll meet a whole new group of friends, along with a few favorite characters from Heroes for Hire. Instead of action, you’ll find emotion. Instead of suspense, you’ll find healing. Instead of romance, … oh, wait. … There is romance—of course! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Hathaway House. Rehab Center. Safe Haven. Second chance at life and love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Navy SEAL Cole Chamberlain entered Hathaway House weeks ago, he was doing well. His meds were under control; his recovery was progressing at a safe rate, and he was getting better every day. But, left to his own devices, Cole pushed himself too hard and took himself off his medication—and ended up causing himself harm and earned himself time in a hospital. Now he’s returned, hoping that Hathaway House can get him back on track one more time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RN Sandra Denver feels responsible for what happened to Cole. She was his nurse and should have realized that he wasn’t ready to leave Hathaway House. His setback was her fault, or at least she could have prevented it, if she’d made sure he was taking those meds she gave him daily. Now that he’s back, she’s finding it hard to trust not just him but herself. And she understands, when Cole has a hard time trusting himself too, it won’t make his recovery any easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Cole’s sake, Sandra must help him overcome his stumbling blocks as well as her own. With any luck, they’ll find a second chance at recovery, for both of them, at Hathaway House.</description>

Instead of romance, … oh, wait. … There is romance—of course! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Hathaway House. Rehab Center. Safe Haven. Second chance at life and love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Navy SEAL Brock Gorman has been at Hathaway House for more than a month with minimal improvement to either his physical or mental health. An vehicle accident on base two months ago caused major hip, back, and shoulder injuries that and took away any chance he had of ever going on a mission again. Making it through BUD/S training and into the SEALs teams was the crowning glory of Brock’s life. Now it’s gone. Why try to get better when he has nothing left to live for? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Physiotherapist Sidney Morning has been away from Hathaway House for nine months of specialized training. When she returns, there’s Brock. And, while she loves the tough cases, he might be more than she can handle. He’s big. He’s strong. He’s stubborn. He’s gorgeous. And he’s not making the efforts needed to get better. But, if Sidney can get under his skin and force him to jumping hurdles he’s not interested in jumping, she can help him see that there are things which still make life worth living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly as Sidney and Brock fight their own emotions and each other, pushing Brock where he needs to go. … If they are lucky, he might find both healing and love at Hathaway House.</description>

  <description>There’s a legend amongst members of the Wicked Throttle MC. Something that’s rooted deep into their DNA. Once a soul finds its other half, there is no going back. Only one option; Love and claim at first sight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The danger lurking at every turn in her life has left Adley alone and on the run. That is until a certain biker finally tracked her down and is determined to help her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quill can’t get the woman who he couldn’t hold onto out of his head and heart. Dead set to pull her out of the danger she’s wrapped in, he stumbles into a web where not only Adley, but others are tangled in as well. Can they take one day at a time to explore their connection and save those around them? Or will a shift of direction spiral into a lost chance in love and life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quill can be read as a HEA standalone but does have a cliffhanger involving the next character (book four in this series). For a greater reading experience, recommended reading order: &lt;br /&gt;"Corban" Wicked Throttle MC #0.5 &lt;br /&gt;"Zerox" Wicked Throttle MC #1 &lt;br /&gt;"Barlow" Wicked Throttle MC #2 &lt;br /&gt;“Quill” Wicked Throttle MC #3 &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What should’ve been a simple fact-finding visit changed in the blink of an eye. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a patriot. A CIA officer. A master at manipulating the double agent schemes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The straight and narrow path I set out on turned into a hundred winding roads, all leading to the same destination: I’m now aiding and abetting a foreign spy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kira Petrov stole something from me the moment we met—my breath, my heart, my allegiance. If I’m caught, I’ll be tried as a traitor. But there’s more to her story than anyone knows, and time is not on our side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only way out this tangled mess is to march straight through it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Staying between the imaginary lines on a map is easy when the boundaries are clearly defined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s that blurred line in real life that trips up the best of us.</description>

  <description>Retired Navy SEAL and current private-security operative Ian Sawyer had never expected to have a child, much less a wife, but his beautiful Angie has changed all that. Her due date is only days away, and his anticipation outweighs his anxiety, thinking about holding his firstborn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as he’s learned the hard way, life throws curveballs at the worst possible moment. A frantic phone call in the middle of the night is the beginning of Ian’s nightmare. He has to wake his brothers and teammates, leave his wife’s side, and fly halfway around the world to save the only other woman who could bring him to his knees—his mother. &lt;br /&gt;The following is the best reading order for the original Trident Security series and its intertwined spinoff series - Doms of The Covenant, Deimos, TS Omega Team, and Blackhawk Security: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 1 - Leather &amp;amp; Lace (Devon &amp;amp; Kristen) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 2 - His Angel (Ian &amp;amp; Angie) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 3 - Waiting For Him (Boomer &amp;amp; Kat) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 3.5 - Not Negotiable: A Novella (Parker &amp;amp; Shelby) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 4 - Topping the Alpha (Jake &amp;amp; Nick) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 5 - Watching From the Shadows (Marco &amp;amp; Harper) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 5.5 - Whiskey Tribute: A Novella (Curt &amp;amp; Dana) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 6 - Tickle His Fancy (Brody &amp;amp; Fancy) &lt;br /&gt;No Way In Hell Book 1 &amp;amp; Book 2 (Co-authored with JB Havens) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 7 - Absolving His Sins (Carter &amp;amp; Jordyn) &lt;br /&gt;DOTC Book 1 - Double Down &amp;amp; Dirty (Gray, Remi, &amp;amp; Abigail) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 7.5 - Option Number Three: A Novella (Mitch, Tyler, &amp;amp; Tori) &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Prequel - Mountain of Evil: A Novella &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Book 1 - A Dead Man's Pulse (Logan &amp;amp; Dakota) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 8 - Salvaging His Soul (Jase &amp;amp; Brie) &lt;br /&gt;Deimos Book 1 - Handling Haven (Frisco &amp;amp; Haven) &lt;br /&gt;DOTC Book 2 - Entertaining Distraction (Mike &amp;amp; Charlotte) &lt;br /&gt;Deimos Book 2 - Cheating the Devil (Brad &amp;amp; Avery) &lt;br /&gt;Blackhawk Security Book 1 - Tuff Enough (Tuff &amp;amp; Chet) &lt;br /&gt;Trident Security Field Manual: A Collection of Short Stories and More! &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Book 2 - Forty Days &amp;amp; One Knight (Darius &amp;amp; Tahira) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 8.5 - Torn in Half: A Novella &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*The books of the Trident Security series and its spin-off series can be read as standalones, however, for optimum enjoyment they are best read in order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**The Trident Security series contains elements of the BDSM lifestyle, sensual romance, nail-biting suspense, and happily-ever-afters.</description>

  <description>I only wanted a cup of coffee. Alone. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;It was a simple request, right? Just stroll into the coffee shop on the corner, grab my usual cup of liquid nitrogen, and walk back out. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;All while minding my own business. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;But I had to walk in at that exact moment. Not ten minutes earlier. Not ten minutes later. Precisely when Savannah Fields needed someone to help her. When no one except me had the courage to stand up for her. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;After the incident, she looked at me like I was her hero. &lt;br /&gt;But I’m no hero. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t even know who or what I am anymore. &lt;br /&gt;Who is Nick Tucker? A DEA agent? A criminal? Both? Neither? &lt;br /&gt;The lines I crossed while undercover blurred my staunch sense of morality. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Then the auburn-haired beauty showed up at my apartment, begging for my help. I couldn’t turn her away. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The more I lost myself in her, the more I found myself again. &lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought. &lt;br /&gt;Even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day. &lt;br /&gt;There's a fine line between right and wrong, love and hate, heaven and hell. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to &lt;i&gt;Hathaway House&lt;/i&gt;. Rehab Center. Safe Haven. Second chance at life and love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Navy SEAL Aaron Hammond has no idea how he wound up at Hathaway House, Texas. Nor does he particularly care. All he can see is his anger. Anger at the betrayal that destroyed his physical body and at the loss of the future he wanted but that he’ll never have now. He’s a cripple, less than half a man, and all he can look forward to is a half life, alone with himself and his pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani Hathaway runs Hathaway House with her father, an ex-military man nicknamed the Major, and she knew Aaron and his brother SEAL Levi in another life. Levi was a good friend to her through her difficult teen years, but it was Aaron who caught her eye more than a decade ago. When she heard what happened to him, she moved heaven and earth to get him to Hathaway House, where she could help him regain his health and return him to the man he used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old feelings resurface as Dani continues to push Aaron to acknowledge that his life is not over, and that, if he chooses, he can find both love and a future at Hathaway House.</description>

Suspenseful plot that does contain some violence and talk of rape though this isn't graphic or explicit so not enough to trigger anyone I wouldn't have thought.

  <description>Princess Tahira had grown up not worrying about being pushed into an arranged marriage, but after her mother’s near-death illness, King Rajeemh orders his only daughter to choose a husband within forty days or have one chosen for her. While the deadline looms, Tahira and her cousin are kidnapped during a trip to Jamaica. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trident Security operative, Darius Knight, has been working undercover for several months, infiltrating a human-trafficking cartel. Just when he’s almost in the position to take them down, a huge wrench is thrown into the mission. If he saves the woman whose body he’s guarded in the past, his cover will be blown. But if he doesn’t, he’ll never be able to live with the results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the rescue doesn’t go as planned, Darius makes a rash decision that will affect both their lives. To keep their secret means he’ll probably lose his dream job. To reveal it will destroy the woman who is inching her way into his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*If you prefer trigger warnings, please scroll down to the bottom. If you don't want to read the trigger warning, this is your chance to avoid it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The following is the best reading order for the original Trident Security series and its intertwined spinoff series - Doms of The Covenant, Deimos, TS Omega Team, and Blackhawk Security: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 1 - Leather &amp;amp; Lace (Devon &amp;amp; Kristen) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 2 - His Angel (Ian &amp;amp; Angie) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 3 - Waiting For Him (Boomer &amp;amp; Kat) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 3.5 - Not Negotiable: A Novella (Parker &amp;amp; Shelby) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 4 - Topping the Alpha (Jake &amp;amp; Nick) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 5 - Watching From the Shadows (Marco &amp;amp; Harper) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 5.5 - Whiskey Tribute: A Novella (Curt &amp;amp; Dana) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 6 - Tickle His Fancy (Brody &amp;amp; Fancy) &lt;br /&gt;No Way In Hell Book 1 &amp;amp; Book 2 (Co-authored with JB Havens) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 7 - Absolving His Sins (Carter &amp;amp; Jordyn) &lt;br /&gt;DOTC Book 1 - Double Down &amp;amp; Dirty (Gray, Remi, &amp;amp; Abigail) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 7.5 - Option Number Three (Mitch, Tyler, &amp;amp; Tori) &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Prequel - Mountain of Evil &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Book 1 - A Dead Man's Pulse (Logan &amp;amp; Dakota) &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 8 - Salvaging His Soul (Jase &amp;amp; Brie) &lt;br /&gt;Deimos Book 1 - Handling Haven (Frisco &amp;amp; Haven) &lt;br /&gt;DOTC Book 2 - Entertaining Distraction (Mike &amp;amp; Charlotte) &lt;br /&gt;Deimos Book 2 - Cheating the Devil (Brad &amp;amp; Avery) &lt;br /&gt;Blackhawk Security Book 1 - Tuff Enough &lt;br /&gt;Trident Security Field Manual &lt;br /&gt;TSOT Book 2 - Forty Days &amp;amp; One Knight &lt;br /&gt;TS Book 9 - Torn in Half (Coming Soon) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*The books of the Trident Security series and its spin-off series can be read as standalones, however, for optimum enjoyment they are best read in order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**The Trident Security series contains elements of the BDSM lifestyle, sensual romance, nail-biting suspense, and happily-ever-afters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Trigger warning: Forty Days &amp;amp; One Knight contains a fade to black sexual assault.

  <description>Devon “Shadow” Kane chose a life of anonymity the moment he entered the clandestine world of the CIA. His training made him a killer, a skill he has no qualms using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Sinclair, the younger sister of his childhood friend, is far from the girl next door. She’ll be the next big star. She’s also the one he can’t have. The blinding lights of flash bulbs in her celebrity world contradict the stealth and invisibility required in his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Then she’s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappeared, without a word or a trace.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate plea for help from her brother tests Shadow’s undercover skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stakes are high, and Shadow will risk everything for her. The only two constants in the equation are the threat of blowing his cover and the probability he won’t reach her in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With peril at every turn, can Shadow and Elle both survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will the &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Wicked Shadows&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; surrounding them ultimately cause their demise?</description>

  <description>What if every long-held belief had been a lie?&lt;br /&gt;What if learning the truth changed everything?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What if everything you've ever believed turned out to be a lie? &lt;br /&gt;What if learning the truth changes everything? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton “Bull” Lanier thinks his life is all figured out. His trust is hard earned. He lets no one see the man inside. He doesn’t believe in love and he doesn’t get involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she walks into his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more to Steele Security’s newest client, Chaise, than what meets the eye. She's in trouble, but she's also hiding something and keeping her secrets close to the vest. With her life in danger, Bull reluctantly agrees to protect her and help find a missing girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their attraction flares hot enough to burn them, Bull gives Chaise something very rare–his trust. But as worlds collide, lifelong secrets are revealed, making Bull question everything he ever believed. When Chaise disappears, the men of Steele Security are on the case. But, will they reach her in time? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will Bull handle the wicked ties that bind? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for readers 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual content.</description>

  <description>Investigative reporter Brianna Tate stumbled upon a career-making story that changed her entire life. When the trail led her into a dangerous web of lies, she was forced to choose between destroying the man she loved or giving up her entire life to enter WITSEC. After three years of living as someone else, everything changed when her true identity and location were discovered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah “Reaper” Steele created a successful business in Steele Security, but he never fully recovered after he lost Brianna. He shared his bed with other women but they never had his heart. Noah's life solely revolved around his work. Everything changed the night he caught an intruder in his house and learned it was actually his long-dead love, Brianna. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With their reunion, they discovered the passion that fueled their relationship was still alive, burning hotter than ever. However, even Noah’s love couldn’t erase the sting of her betrayal, and he wrestled with allowing her back in his life. Brianna was the only woman he’d ever loved, but he wasn’t sure he could forgive her treachery. For both to survive, Noah and Brianna had to band together, uncover the truth, and reveal the real threat before it was too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In his fight against the wicked games that surrounded him, would he end up losing her all over again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE: This is the same extended edition that replaced the contents of the original book and this is only being added in order to update the audiobook.

  <description>Rhy Ellison, former elite Navy SEAL Commander, retired from the teams the same way he lived, in a blaze of glory. After nearly thirty years of stellar service, he almost crashes and burns, but his hard-earned reputation saves him from a court martial. Now all he wants is to kick back in Margaritaville, but the Department of Homeland Security has other ideas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The DHS Special Group Leader offers him a contract he couldn’t refuse, they need him to put his famed skills back in the game and help recover vital information stolen from a CIA asset overseas. When Rhy learns the CIA pain-in-the-asset involved is none other than Harper Chandler, a woman he never wants to see again, much less work with, taking the mission becomes a no-go, even with the money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then he learns the missing dossier could clear him of crimes he’s been accused of that led to his court martial, Ryh signs on without a second thought. The opportunity to clear his name is too important to be brushed aside. Especially by the woman directly responsible of killing his men, and almost his career. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’ll pay the price of working with the beautiful, cocky, know-it-all if that’s what it takes. But he refuses to allow her to get him killed or give her another shot at his heart.</description>

  <description>**WARNING; The Complete Lost Valkyries MC series is filled with six short, standalone romance stories. Includes: Love at first sight. Off the charts chemistry. And each story will leave you wanting more!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crane - The job was to prevent her from testifying. No matter the consequences or obstacles, I will get it done. Something that the woman strapped to my back will find out firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronin - I answer to no one. As the Prez of Lost Valkyries MC, people answer to me, not the other way around. No exceptions. Yet she made me take a turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bark - Those I consider deserve to die, will be killed by me, without any remorse. Yet when my fingers slide over her skin it's as if I can feel the life slip right into me to enlighten my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris - There's only one who carries the promise to expel your darkest fear. One they hire to deal with an enemy they can't face alone. That one? That's me. Paris might relate to the city of love, but for Lyra it's also the name of the biker that claimed her, as well as her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titan - I want to settle down with her, and only her. She's the perfect Old Lady, and I ain't a fool passing up a good thing when it's thrown into my path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gust - Have you ever disassembled a ticking bomb? I have. Steady as fuck hand, the longest last breath, and the will to live. There’s nothing I can’t do and I have to admit, with all my brothers claiming an Old Lady, I’ve been craving to claim one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Books in the Lost Valkyries MC series will each be a standalone, short story romance. Every book is passion to love at warp speed. Grip your heart because it's going to be a fast ride...so be warned!**</description>

  <description>Dimitri King is a killer … and an addict. Born into one of the most ruthless motorcycle clubs that ever ran the streets of St Louis, the only life he has ever known is destroying him from the inside out. A lifetime of trauma, bad decisions, and heinous violence has left him on the brink of complete disaster, but one mission will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annalise Hale, daughter of Senator Ronald Hale, is the prima ballerina of the St. Louis Ballet. The picture-perfect trophy from afar, her life is a delicate facade that hides unspeakable pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she wanted was to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never dreamed of this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blameless in her father’s crimes, she is caught up like an exquisite pawn when the Sinners take her. Face-to-face with Dimitri King, like two sides of the same broken mirror, they have scars so deep, pain is the only feeling they know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A match made in heaven but forged in hell, will they find their wounds fit together to create something beautiful or will the sins of their pasts be too great to overcome?</description>

She wakes to life on an isolated island, involving her strange savior, two dogs with unique identities, and voices, sounds, emotions that aren’t hers alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a mystery that makes no sense …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samson heard the cry to save the woman washed onto his shores, and the dogs were already on the job before he arrived. But he had no idea how much impact this woman would make in his life … and his brother’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the mystery is so much bigger than him and her …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus another element is involved.

  <description>Petra and Cade meet at Isaac and Amy’s wedding and their mutual attraction is instantaneous. Neither of them wants a relationship, plus they live on opposite sides of the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they both have a few days left before they must fly off to their normal lives, surely a holiday fling couldn’t harm? Maybe a few nights burning up the sheets is just what they need. No strings sex to get it out of their system before they both walk away with nothing but a fond memory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone’s bound to get hurt when past events influence their futures. Invisible barriers are quickly erected to protect them against history repeating itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the best laid plans can go wrong, especially when the law of attraction is stronger. Can they resist the pull when weakened defences are tested, and barricades begin to crumble? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 in the Reed and Rice Series. Book 1 &amp;amp; 2 available to download now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;+18 contains sexual scenes, bad language, laughs and a possible WTF moment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Back home in Leeds, Amy Reed is jobless and out of sorts, until she manages to bag herself a new start in Bath. New job, new apartment and new acquaintances. Girly nights out, Sambuca shots and a run in or two with a hot rugby player. The perfect scenario to help her forget about Isaac and his sorry arse. Or is it… &lt;br /&gt;‘Wow! Look at the hotties at the bar,” Petra points. &lt;br /&gt;Looking round, I see a group of guys all in sports gear, one of them being Justin. &lt;br /&gt;“Oh, the one in the middle is my neighbour, he plays rugby for Bath.” &lt;br /&gt;“Phwr! I wouldn't mind getting in a scrum with him,” says Petra. “How come you have only been here two minutes, and you’re already putting the moves on the local men?” &lt;br /&gt;Justin catches my eye, and gives me a little wave. I offer a delicate, unassuming wave back, only to catch Kat and Petra waving at him like a couple of flapper girls. These two are going to get me into so much trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Isaac Rice wants, Isaac Rice will do absolutely anything to get, and Amy is the only thing in his sight. &lt;br /&gt;‘Who the f**k is this Justin guy? I'm not happy, he seems to be spending a lot of time in her apartment, and often till late. If he's touching her, I'll rip his f’ing head off. &lt;br /&gt;I can't wait much longer. I'm itching to make a move, make my presence known. &lt;br /&gt;Soon. Very Soon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rice Back At You! – Reed And Rice Series – Book 2 concludes Amy and Isaac’s story, told in Naughty But Rice – Reed And Rice Series – Book 1. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** This novel contains mature sexual content and bad language. It is not intended for younger readers or people that are easily offended. *** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When 26 year old Amy Reed’s promotion sends her down to London to meet a prospective new client, she gets a lot more than she bargains for. The hot American she meets in the hotel bar, is more than willing to show her exactly what she has been missing for the past few years, but will she give into temptation... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Thank you for seeing me to my room,” I whisper, as he leans in, putting his mouth to my ear, and I can feel his hot breath. &lt;br /&gt;“There are so many things I would really like to do to you... just say the word.” &lt;br /&gt;My whole body is quivering with just the thought of what he is offering. &lt;br /&gt;“I may be a little drunk, but I am not a one night stand type of girl.” &lt;br /&gt; F**k! My brain says no, but my body says ‘Go Girl.’ The sensible me takes charge, although it may have something to do with the Bridget Jones Knickers, and the larger ladies serviceable bra I’m wearing, that have seen better days, lurking under my clothing. A sure thing to put an end to any passion fest. &lt;br /&gt;The question is, will she be able to refuse him a second time? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Isaac Rice’s exterior appearance is all business, but under the suit is a whole different kind of American Guy. When Isaac wants something, he will do whatever it takes to get it. &lt;br /&gt;Her touch made my body react instantly and I struggled to control my twitching c**k. When I walked her to her room, I just couldn’t keep my hands off her. I want her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** This novel contains mature sexual content , bad language and a few giggles. It is not intended for younger readers or people that are easily offended. *** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part one of two - Reed and Rice Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;27545 words apx. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Retired US Navy SEAL Commander Gabriel Michaels has finally found peace after decades of active duty and two failed marriages. No tangoes, no red tape, no women — just his rifle, his fishing pole, and his loyal coon hound on a pristine piece of lakefront heaven. But when the Assistant Director of Homeland Security asks for his help, he can’t say no. Not only is it a case of national security, it’s finally a chance for Gabe to avenge his fallen teammates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the irritating woman who slips his dog cookies and is so willing to help? She’s a great source of inside information… and unexpected temptation. But can she be trusted? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Virginia Miller is used to working quietly from the shadows as a personal assistant to a powerful, wealthy businessman. That all changes when her boss suddenly goes missing and she’s thrust into a world of deception and international terrorism. To further complicate things, the compelling former SEAL with incredible green eyes thinks she’s the key to unravelling the mystery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The most ironic thing of all is… he’s right. And he could ruin everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SEAL Out of Water&lt;/i&gt; is a stand-alone military romantic suspense with slow-burn romance and plenty of twists and turns to a happy ending you’ll never see coming.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A career ending injury forced Creed Lachlan out of the Navy SEALs. Now he works as a freelance contractor for a highly classified sub-set of Homeland Security, the Bone Frog Division. His country calls when it needs his elite skills. His current mission is to identify the production site for emerging “dirty” bombs. If that dictate wasn't enough, his team must locate the missing CIA agents who’d previously tracked the weapons, and that team's last known location was Cuba. His contact in Cuba wasn't the sixty-year-old man he'd been told to expect, but a sultry beauty hellbent on driving him insane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mariella Diaz’s uncle sat atop the largest black-market organization in Cuba. Outmaneuvering the corrupt communist regime to provide the people of her country with necessities was second nature. Even so, keeping the sexy American and his team out of danger would require extra diligence. In a game of cat and mouse played out in a deadly arena, Mariella faces a risk more perilous than capture, torture, and imprisonment. She risked losing her heart to Creed Lachlan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Creed wanted Mariella. He wanted to ease the pain that peeked through her bravado, to love and protect the woman who defied and antagonized him at every turn. Creed’s only concern, could she love a SEAL, forever?</description>

  <description>Juliette Shaw has everything a girl could ask for – a thriving business, a beautiful home, loyal friends, and a gorgeous fiancé – but she doesn’t remember any of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a horrific car accident steals her father’s life and five years of her memory, she is lost in a world she doesn’t recognize and is desperately searching for answers. Nothing feels right and behind each clue from her past are more questions, so she does the only thing she can do – run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Michelson, brother of the Bayou Devils MC, looks intimidating as hell and a smart girl like Juliette knows better than to accept a ride from a stranger but there’s something about his deep blue eyes that puts Juliette at ease and pulls her in. He makes her heart race and the longer she spends with him, the more she discovers the sweet, funny, and loyal man beneath the mask. But even a thousand miles from home, danger seems to find her, leaving Juliette to wonder if it’s just bad luck or if she is in more trouble than she realized. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Juliette recover her past and find answers or will she lose more than just her memories this time?</description>

  <description>When opposites attract... anything can happen... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dezi was a plain-and-simple type of guy. He loved working for Levi's company and had enjoyed the jobs he'd been given so far. When a businesswoman contacted Ice over, well, ice, ... things got interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamond was an exclusive jewelry designer, born and raised in the industry, working within her father's diamond company. When a custom-designed item was checked before shipment, she realized the piece wasn't her workmanship. Somehow someone had forged her work and had slipped it in the shipment as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the theft and forgery quickly escalate to kidnapping and armed robbery. Dezi and Diamond need to figure this out fast, before something else gets added to the list: murder.</description>

I did until one day, she vanished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicked Truths by L A Cotton &lt;br /&gt;The truth won’t fix anything... it’ll only hurt more. Won’t it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter by Lauren Dawes &lt;br /&gt;A mate's death. A rogue wolf.

  <description>They think I'm sick in the head. &lt;br /&gt;I might be. I am who I am and I don't apologize for it. &lt;br /&gt;When my sister goes missing, I step up and take action. &lt;br /&gt;My Prez throws me a bone with a hot little girl that has been through a lot of trauma herself. &lt;br /&gt;I'm not looking for love. In fact, I'm not all that sure that I hold that emotion in me. &lt;br /&gt;But I can have some fun with her. &lt;br /&gt;Our lives are far from the same but she gives me a strength I didn't know I needed. &lt;br /&gt;My fear? I'm going to ruin her.</description>

  <description>Every detail of the wedding was planned... Except romanceWhen events planner Cammie Yarnell agrees to do a wedding at the Oceanside Bed and Breakfast, she knows the tough part will be keeping a smile on her face. Not too long ago she'd planned a walk down the aisle at the sumptuous B and B herself-and called it off. Worse, she's working this event with Finn Brannigan, the photographer who knew all about her fianc�'s cheating and kept it a secret, betraying her trust as a friend.Yet her anger starts to fade once the showers and dinner parties bring her closer to Finn. Now his misguided belief that he's bad for her is standing in the way of Cammie's trip to the altar-with him.</description>

  <description>As a former SEAL commander, Dex Carson had participated in more than his share of rescues. When called upon to lead a multi-agency team into the Virgin Islands National Park jungle to rescue high value targets, he knew he was headed for trouble. Ten teenage girls—whose parents were members of Congress—and their chaperones, needed saving from kidnappers. He cringed. The thought of entitled children and diva mothers made him clench his teeth. When he saw she was on his team, he was ready to quit. His heart couldn’t take it. But a SEAL never quits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At forty-two, Rayne Yoshida felt too old to go tromping through the jungle after the Speaker of the House’s new wife. The recalcitrant prima donna had slipped her usual Secret Service protection and followed her sweet-as-sugar stepdaughter to the Caribbean on a student work/adventure trip. But as Agent in Charge of the Speaker’s detail, she had to go. Her mood darkened when she saw their team leader, the bull-headed, bossy, but oh so sexy, Dex Carson. They had history…that had almost gotten her fired. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a category five hurricane bearing down on the tiny island, they only have days to find and rescue the girls and their chaperones…and keep their hands off each other.</description>

  <description>She’s the only one to get past his guard…he’s the only one to break down her walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly thirty years, retired US Navy SEAL Commander Archer Malone made the Navy his home. Now he’s out and tasked by a secret Bone Frog division of DHS to lead a hand-picked civilian team. Their mission: locate and eliminate a rogue crew chatter indicates intends to target Wall Street.&lt;br /&gt;The problem: no one knows what they look like, or if they plan to rob or bomb the World Bank.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger problem: one of his team members is the attractive – off limits – single mother of a Navy SEAL he once commanded.&lt;br /&gt;Sandy Vickers is as good at blending in as she is at locating people. A skill she honed working for the D.A.’s office while her son was young, then for DHS after he joined the Navy. Proud of him for following in his late father’s footsteps and serving the country, she jumps at the chance to do her part too when offered a spot on a secret DHS team. Too bad the SEAL in charge is her son’s sexy former commander…the one who always leapfrog’d her pulse.&lt;br /&gt;Forced proximity soon snaps their control, and they give in to their attraction. But when their location is attacked, Archer realizes the economy isn’t the only thing threatened with destabilization. Now their lives – and hearts – are on the line, and this silver SEAL is determined to keep Sandy safe, unmask and hunt down the traitor, and take out the rogue crew…before they all run out of time.</description>

  <description>Great for fans of Susan Mallery, Bella Andre, and Marie Force. Just the Way You Are is a small town, feel-good romance, the first in a four-book series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a painful breakup and the loss of her job, Cinnamon Smith is battered and bruised. The only place to go is her best friend Fran’s bed-and-breakfast in the small coastal town of Dunlin Shores, Oregon. The first person she meets on her arrival is Nick Mahoney, Fran’s handyman. Cinnamon’s attraction to Nick is immediate, and the feeling is definitely mutual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Cinnamon has spent years working toward a certain kind of life, a life she can’t have with Nick. Spending time in Dunlin Shores and with him is beginning to change all that. Then she gets a job offer that will put her career goals back on track… Which means choosing between the life she’s always wanted and the love that’s right in front of her. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>His best friend’s wife is in trouble… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A panicked phone call sends Kanan flying across the ocean to find that she’s been held captive in her apartment, tortured for something her dead husband supposedly hid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only she knows nothing about it and her husband is, well, dead… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dead men don’t talk – or do they? As they unravel the mystery Kanan has to delve into his friend’s life to see what he’d done that put his wife in jeopardy. And find her captor, before he decides to kill her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Laysa doesn’t know what this man wants, but after seeing Kanan again after so long she knows what she wants. But is it a betrayal of her husband? Then why was her husband hiding things? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And why did her captor want them? Even worse, if he got them in his possession, what was he planning to do with them? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Live&lt;/b&gt; is to grab hold of your dreams and take the next step that will get you there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earle has been housesitting for his brother, Roscoe, for years. He never expected to take out the trash one day and find a gem bright enough to light his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savvy is fleeing from danger to another country. With her life in turmoil, a series of events finds her tumbling from royalty to penniless and in hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can these two from worlds apart find a unity driven by reality and shared goals? Or will Savvy's roots force a wedge too big for love to cross?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Love&lt;/b&gt; is to take a chance with your heart, and with eyes wide open, find the essential element to make your life complete.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roscoe dedicated his life to his job in law enforcement. Undercover work has carved him into the man he is today; hard, damaged, and with a deep realization, he lost himself and his family along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Febe's been committed to solving cases and doing the right thing all her life. When her best friend, Savvy, asks Febe to find her brother-in-law, Roscoe, she doesn't think twice and accepts the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though going undercover wasn't at all what Febe expected, will it be worth risking her heart or even her own life? Will Roscoe turn his back on his family and the whole world as well? Or will Febe and Roscoe have a fighting chance to support each other while recovering from unhealed wounds life has inflicted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;

  <description>After twenty-five years of active duty, US Navy SEAL Commander Eric Lopez chaffed at his forced medical retirement. Bored, he jumped at the opportunity to work for a DHS Secret Division Command. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility had just opened and was already embroiled in controversy. One group protesting the facility want it shut down due to safety concerns. An animal extremist group in the area is known for terrorist activities. And, a contingency of foreign scientists and journalists will be visiting the facility and the cyber security chatter is that someone there will be threatening the facility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his background in biology, Eric is the perfect choice to go in to assess the situation as part of the foreign delegation, never expecting to fall for a beautiful veterinarian working there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lydia Hughes, a veterinarian at the facility, takes a chance on love again with a man she thinks is a journalist. But, just her luck, she ends up in the hands of kidnappers who have mistaken her for a lead scientist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eric pulls together a team and they race to find Lydia before the kidnappers discover they have the wrong person and dispose of her. Saving her life is his mission. Falling for the beautiful doctor became the unexpected reward. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scenes in the book are similar to what you would find in an "R" rated movie. Intended for readers 18+.</description>

  <description>Drew has found her perfect, tattooed ever after with her man, Sketch. The MC families are all able to relax because there’s no longer an enemy in hiding, wanting to hurt them, but the Kings men have been keeping secrets from their women. Those that have been waiting for their time are about to step out from the shadows and wreak havoc on the Kings of Rebellion MC. When disaster strikes to hurt more than one person, it seems that it is the end for their loved ones, and Drew is left wondering if her heart can handle the pain.</description>

  <description>This isn't your typical love story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lauren doesn’t know why she is such a bitch, but she is. She believes in being who you are and fuck those who don’t like it. Her ex is pissed, and she soon realises the hard way that she never should have betrayed him. Yet, pretty-boy Andrew isn’t as innocent as she thought. In fact, it turns out he’s connected to one of the biggest gangs in America. &lt;br /&gt;Lauren is beaten and abused in every way possible. Her human rights are stripped, and she is treated like an animal. Blindfolded and gagged, Lauren has no idea what is going to become of her, or if she will ever get out of the mess she has found herself in. &lt;br /&gt;Karma has finally caught up with Lauren Ashford, but is this the end, or can someone out there help her? Are there men strong enough, or even brave enough, to face up to her captors? &lt;br /&gt;When the Philadelphia Kings of Rebellion charter come crashing into her kidnappers’ motorcycle club's cabin, they find a beautiful girl chained up to a wall and made to live like a dog on the hard floor. &lt;br /&gt;From here, Lauren is given the greatest gift. To go home. Once back in the UK, Lauren is under the protection of the UK Kings of Rebellion MC and is shocked to find that even though they are dangerous, they treat her so much better. Here she meets Grim, the oldest son of the president. He’s covered in tattoos, drives a bike, likes to dress in leather and loves to protect her. Is this the man that Lauren needs? Or do her old habits of being a “do now, think later” kind of bitch, come back to bite her in the ass? &lt;br /&gt;One thing is for certain, Demon, the president of the motorcycle club who took her, wants her back... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***WARNING. THIS BOOK HAS SOME STRONG SCENES THAT SOME MAY FIND OFFENSIVE. READ THIS BOOK WITH A STRONG HEART***</description>

      <![CDATA[Lots of action and some graphic violence and abuse in this intense but suspenseful read. This is hard to take at some of the most graphic of scenes but it is a fabulous plot and an interesting take on Bikers of the more extreme clubs, the ones that feel its their right to do what they want with w...]]>

  <description>My name is Techie &lt;br /&gt;Gadgets and gizmos are my weapons of choice. &lt;br /&gt;I'm a hardcore tech guru for the Satan's Savages MC. &lt;br /&gt;My life's not about love, it's about lust and the pleasures it brings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My name is Shay. &lt;br /&gt;I'm a legacy - a daughter and sister of the club. &lt;br /&gt;My family doesn't want me to fall for a biker. &lt;br /&gt;But he caught my attention... right from the start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He is lost. &lt;br /&gt;She is finding her way. &lt;br /&gt;Can they find a new hope together? &lt;br /&gt;Or will everyone and everything stand in their way? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shay had been a part of this world since her birth. She knows bikers and isn't scared of what this life entails. But when an unknown threat torments the club, can Techie protect her from their faceless enemy, or is there an even greater enemy outside of the club that could tear them apart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watch as Shay is completely Taken by Techie.</description>

      <![CDATA[A little milder than the other books in this series, it still has some action and excitement but nowhere near as extreme or full on as the other books. Techie comes across as quite gentle where Shay is concerned, but tough when he needs to be for the club. I find Gadget on the other very insecure...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. ... Controlling to chaos. ... But murder ... well maybe …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doreen’s success at solving murders has hit the newswires across the country, but all Doreen wants is to be left alone. She has antiques to get to the auction house and a relationship with Corporal Mack Moreau to work out, not to mention a new friendship to nurture with Penny, Doreen’s first friend in Kelowna, and Doreen doesn’t want to ruin things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a surprise accusation won’t leave Doreen alone—about Penny’s late husband George’s death and made by one of the men Doreen helped put away—she thinks that maybe it can’t hurt to just take a quick look into her new friend’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Doreen knows it, she’s juggling a cold case, a closed case, and a possible mercy killing … along with cultivating her relationships with Penny, Mack, and Doreen’s pets: Mugs, the basset hound; Goliath, the Maine coon cat, and Thaddeus, the far-too-talkative African gray parrot. And while Mack should be used to Doreen’s antics by now, when she dives into yet another of his cases it’s becoming increasingly hard to take ...</description>

  <description>After spending the last two years stuck behind bars for a crime she didn’t commit, Harlow ‘Princess’ Gavelson’s time inside has finally come to an end, and she’s ready for revenge. Unfortunately, being the daughter to the Vice President of the Ravage Motorcycle Club cuts into her plans, as orders must be followed. Trying to settle back into this life is proving difficult when the tables are turned and the woman who framed her is out for blood. Lucky for Princess, growing up in a MC has taught her how to hold her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending years in hell overseas, Donavon ‘Cruz’ came home to lose the very thing he went into hell for, sending him to the darkest moments of his life. Joining Ravage two years ago was his safe haven, and he protects his family at all costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a dark-haired bombshell struts into the club’s shop, he’s caught off guard but immediately knows she’s the one he’d do anything for. Tough as nails, and taking no crap from anyone, he’s captivated by a woman who could handle this life. Trying to meet the needs of the MC business and follow his heart proves to be difficult when the two collide, and lives are at stake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can these two find a way to be together, or will the needs of Ravage cost them everything, including their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;*Contains mature content including, sex and violence. Mature audiences only.*&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the first book in the new &lt;i&gt;SEAL of Protection: Legacy&lt;/i&gt; series. It is a spin off of the original &lt;i&gt;SEAL&lt;/i&gt; series. It will have a whole new team of Navy SEALs (that you have already met in &lt;i&gt;Protecting Dakota&lt;/i&gt;) and takes place in the same city and Navy base as the original.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is Caite McCallan and Blake "Rocco" Wise's story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caite McCallan is a Department of Defense admin working in Bahrain when a glitchy elevator, of all things, leads to an unexpected invitation to dinner by a gorgeous Navy SEAL. When he later stands her up, Caite’s understandably upset… until she overhears a plot that confirms Rocco didn’t blow her off. Instead, he and two fellow SEALs are in danger — and Caite is forced to put her career and her life on the line to save them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake “Rocco” Wise never expected his routine mission to go sideways, but he was even more surprised to find himself and his teammates rescued by the adorably shy woman he met in a stalled elevator. Caite’s selfless act saved his life, but when attempts on her own make it clear someone wants her gone, it’s Rocco’s turn to protect the brave, sweet, sexy woman. The longer he knows her, the more he wants her… but keeping Caite close could bring her nearer to the enemy than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Securing Caite&lt;/i&gt; is the 1st book in the &lt;i&gt;SEAL of Protection: Legacy&lt;/i&gt; series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Mad Dog.&lt;br /&gt;I’m the President of the Virginia Satan’s Savages MC. &lt;br /&gt;I’m a crazed man with nothing left to fight for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Amelia.&lt;br /&gt;My life’s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;All because of my ex-husband and his goddamned motorcycle club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early days, Mad Dog and Amelia were undeniably happy. Their life in the club together, along with their three young boys, was bliss. That was until one fateful night their world turned upside down. Having their lives torn apart pulled them in opposite directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mad Dog is trying to run a club that’s deteriorating, and all he can think of is the family he once had and lost. With the club broken, his family gone and his brothers turning on him, Mad Dog is running the Savages in a direction no one could foresee. He’s becoming crazed. But will the war with the Cartel lead him down a path that will leave everything irreparably damaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Previously published as Meltdown of Mad Dog ***</description>

      <![CDATA[Mad dog spirals out of control in this intensely suspenseful and violent read. I found it a little sad really that a man who was once a decent and loving person with a family and strong values had slipped so far down to the dark side, I understand some of this was due to pressure, even possibly g...]]>

  <description>More than half of Brody’s life has been filled with abuse and torment. He ran away from home at a young age, deciding that life on the streets would be safer. With no one to hold him back, he spent the summers in California and winters in Colorado, seeking the adrenaline rush he got from shredding waves and fresh powder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He never expected to fall for a woman who had everything he didn’t know he needed or wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Paige had everything she ever wanted. With the perfect family and a loving boyfriend, life couldn’t be better. When her life is unexpectedly turned upside down, she suddenly finds herself immersed in death and deceit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to make some sense of her now disheveled life, Paige escapes to Aspen where she reconnects with Brody, the surfer with a bad boy persona that she’s been secretly attracted to for years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When tragedy strikes, Brody’s past collides with his present, ultimately threatening the plans he has for his future. Turning his frustrations on Paige, he allows his self-deprecating past to consume him, and he pushes her away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Paige break through Brody’s walls and convince him that the love they have is enough to conquer the past? Or will the diversity of their lives prove to be too much for even love to break through? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Stealth.&lt;br /&gt;A man torn in two opposing directions.&lt;br /&gt;I'm an undercover cop infiltrating the Satan's Savages MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Skye.&lt;br /&gt;I'm a club girl.&lt;br /&gt;This is the life I know, but I long for something simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Hannah.&lt;br /&gt;I am alone.&lt;br /&gt;The wife of a man who is never here, a ghost in the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going undercover forced Stealth and Hannah into a separation. Their marriage left in tatters. Throwing himself into his new identity as Stealth - bad boy biker of the Satan's Savages MC club - plunged him straight into the arms of club girl, Skye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the Cartel on the club's back and danger at every turn, can Stealth truly turn on the brothers he loves. Will he give his&lt;br /&gt;Unit the intel they need, putting his career before his brothers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it be the club, Skye, or Hannah, who is Stung by Stealth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MC novel contains crude language, sex scenes, and graphic violence. It is not suitable for readers under the age of 18. If any of the above offends you, please do not read any further. This is a complete work of fiction and is not a true representation of a motorcycle club. It is for entertainment purposes only. I hope you enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a work of fiction. Names and characters are the product of the author’s imagination and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead is entirely coincidental.</description>

So when she's thrust into it, can she accept who I am? Will my brothers welcome her as a part of the brotherhood? Or will I have to protect her from the brothers I've grown to love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Willow penetrate my heart of steel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MC novel contains crude language, sex scenes, and graphic violence.

  <description>For Reeve Phoenix, just like for his brothers Rafe and Ryder, women came easy and often. They may have been fun, but easy women never filled the void for Reeve, even with his best friend Skeet sharing his love of a good conquest. Being the son of a famous rockstar changed the way Reeve viewed relationships and women early on. &lt;br /&gt;Then Reeve meets his sister-in-law's best friend and she turns his world on its head. Leah Adams provokes feelings in Reeve that he did not even know he had. &lt;br /&gt;Leah leaves the UK and heads for LA to see her best friend Lucy Cooper. Instead, she runs smack into a man able to destroy her- Reeve Phoenix. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Reeve let Leah in? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Leah take a chance on Reeve? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can two broken souls come together and be one another's reason to take a chance on love again?</description>

The characters are easy to like even when being a bit egotistic and full on rock star mode, it seems though when they meet "The one" they also get a bit stupid and nearly lose it all.

  <description>There’s no limit to pain when the only person to trust is the one who let you down the worst. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Melissa Monroe may rule in the courtroom, but being a lawyer hasn’t helped in her personal life one bit. Every day she lives in fear that someone will find out her secret and to make matters worse, the one person who knows it, has blackmailed her into a relationship she never wanted to be in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her heart has always belonged to Gamble, President of the Brothers of Olympus MC. But the club life scared the hell out of her, and she had no choice but to walk away from Gamble and everything that came with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now to make matters worse, there’s a rival MC terrorizing her to get to the man she thought she left in the past, and Gamble might be her only chance to survive. But that might mean telling him her secret…and that secret could crush them both and get way too many people killed in the crossfire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gabe “Gamble” Smith was born to ride. With his grandfather being the founder of the Brothers of Olympus MC, it was his destiny to take over one day. His rule has always been one of steel and lead, until Melissa Monroe walked into his life. She was the only woman to ever see through his hard exterior and then, he lost her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When another club needs help, Gamble jumped at the opportunity to put a thousand miles between him and the woman who owned his heart but refused to be with him. But no matter how many women warm his bed or how many states are between them, she still owns him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gamble doesn’t hesitate to hightail it back when he gets word that she’s in trouble, deep trouble, and it’s all because of him. He’d do anything for his club, but when he learns the secret the love of his life has kept from him, he’ll move Heaven and Earth, or set the entire world on fire to get her back.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well written and a really good read, lots of build up and suspense with threats, but no major violence. I enjoyed the building relationship between the two main characters and the fact it wasn't rushed at the start, allowing them to get to know each other a bit first.]]>

  <description>Going home wasn’t part of his plan …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to travel home to Maine to hunt down Ketch, a K9 dog the system had lost track of, wasn’t an easy decision for Zane. It meant facing his drunk of a father, his cold older brother and, worst of all, Angela, his kid brother’s widow—who used to be his girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding Ketch looked to be the easiest part of this dysfunctional homecoming. Only he wasn’t the only one hunting Ketch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela has been through a whirlwind of emotions in the last few years. But the good thing in all of this was the hope that Zane would finally come home again. They had a history to clear up and a future to forge … she hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A call for help brings the injured shepherd to Angela’s doorstep, plus a hunter looking to finish what he started. All thoughts of a future with Zane are threatened now and forever as the hunter decides two-legged prey are just as good as four-legged ones.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When one door closes… second chances open another…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan was lost after a major accident abruptly shifted him from a military life to a civilian one, from working with dogs to odd jobs … In that time, he’d spent months healing from his physical injuries. When he connects with Badger and the rest of his Titanium Corp. group of former SEALs, Badger offers Ethan an opportunity he can’t refuse. A chance to do the work he used to do … with a twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon works from home as a project manager plus is heavily involved in global dog rescues—dogs of all kinds. When Ethan walks into the next door’s vet’s office with an injured shepherd in his arms, she sees another lost soul—just like the canine ones she helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan knows he’s about to take a dangerous step, but he’s on the job, and no one—on the job or not—hurts animals while he’s around. This poor shepherd has taken enough abuse, and Ethan fears she is only the tip of a nightmare he’s determined to uncover. But he knows she’s going to lead him in the right direction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He has his sights set on saving one dog in particular, Sentry: K9 File 01.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>As the unofficial Queen of Colombia, international supermodel Marisol Franzi Vallega has it all. A powerful husband, an elegant mansion, and a staff to see to her every whim are among her favorite things, but she wants more. She wants revenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Manuel Vallega has inherited power over one of the largest drug cartels in recent history. Never one to put himself on the front lines he uses others in the organization to conduct business so that he can keep his hands clean and his image untarnished. Money, guns, and women are easy acquisitions, but he desires to be the best in the dirtiest business of all—politics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rabid public craves a super couple to follow in the tabloids and Manny and Marisol are happy to comply. Traveling the world, they attend grand events to create a sparkling illusion of themselves that delights the paparazzi and sells magazines. Having gained the adoration of the public, they ready themselves for the position they desire most—the Presidency of Colombia. But there are hidden motives and dead bodies scattered amongst the stardust. Do they have enough power between them to keep their sins hidden in the shadows? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book Five of The IMPERFECTION Series &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Formerly titled Same Difference &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some hauntings aren’t from ghosts, as Paige Kasey is painfully aware. A confident and stylish professional, she is the youngest owner of a seaside multimillion-dollar real estate agency. But no amount of money could evict her demons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Falcon Grey’s military training has given him an edge to take down the enemy no matter where they hide. As a partner of MarSin Falcon Security, he has an uncanny ability to find the scum that lives in the shadows of the dark web. As a notorious flirt, women are a luxury he can well afford. There is only one woman who kept him at arm's length, and she’s the one he can’t forget. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a visit to Sin City promises Falcon the welcome cocktail of business and pleasure the last bet he would have placed would have been on running into Paige—and what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book Four of The IMPERFECTION Series &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>18+ for language and sexual situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex ‘Hawk’ James has a sordid and violent past, one that, in part, leaves him the single father of a little girl. His only solace is the world he’s made within the Dogs of Fire Motorcycle Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payton Williams has everything under control. Her neat little world is as she has made it and she’s happy with the life she’s leading. But when a chance encounter with a gorgeous biker upends her tidy plans, she finds herself confronting things she’d been happy to gloss over... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Hawk and Payton’s different worlds collide in chaos, or will they come together and heal the wounds of the past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will a threat from someone out of Hawk’s past destroy the trust he and Payton are building?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. … Chaos quiets. … Crime is circling. … And cold cases never cease …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost a month in picturesque Kelowna, Doreen Montgomery still can’t keep her notoriety to a minimum or her nose out of other people’s business. Now those suffering from the loss of a loved one seek her out, wanting her help. While the last thing Doreen wants is to have the media discover she’s involved in another cold case, she is already hooked on the details …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even more is going on. News has gotten out that Nan’s old house is brimming over with valuable antiques, antiques Nan collected and left for Doreen, and the seedier elements of their lovely town are circling like vultures. With her animals in full assistant mode, Doreen must investigate the cold case, right the wrongs of the past, and keep her home safe, all while evading the media—and Corporal Mack Moreau.</description>

  <description>When you're searching for The PERFECT Read, The PERFECT Combination is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author D.D. Lorenzo combines the ONLY cliffhanger in The IMPERFECTION Series with its conclusion. You won't be left hanging when you read No PERFECT Man and No PERFECT Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A love story doesn't always begin with love at first sight, but the Men's Fashion model, Declan Sinclair, may have just become a believer. From the comfort of a beachfront porch, he watches a woman as she strolls along the shoreline. Lost in thought, she doesn't notice him as he sips his coffee. She doesn't meet the requirements that the Fashion Industry dictates of women. She's different, and "different" is its own type of beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria Cole wants to crawl inside herself, pull a blanket over her head, and make the hurt go away. The man she loved more than anything in the world—her father—has died. However, hiding from the world won't solve anything, and her dad would be disappointed to see her do so. Summer vacations at The Skipjack will feel hollow without him, but spending a little bit of quiet time with her memories may minister to her broken heart. The best medicine for her is to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and soak in the healing balm of ocean waters.</description>

  <description>He once picked the wrong woman… he won’t make that mistake again. &lt;br /&gt;Reyes Drere came from a long line of gardeners. He’d known since he was little which way his life was going to go and it had nothing to do with planting seasons. When he joined Legendary Securities after eight years as a Navy SEAL he’d been avoiding going home and joining the family business. &lt;br /&gt;The family business included an ex-fiancé he had no wish to see again. Her sister was a good friend but there was nothing more dead than a dead love – unless it was a dead ex-fiancé… &lt;br /&gt;Raina is reeling from the shock of seeing the only man she’s ever loved showing up at work one day, his new boss in tow. Ice is all about plants on a grand scale, whereas Reyes appears to be all about denial. &lt;br /&gt;Only the shocks continue as her twin and Reyes ex-fiancé show up dead… and he’s the one with a motive… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Sometimes the risk truly was the worth the reward. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rylynn &lt;br /&gt;I knew pain. &lt;br /&gt;I knew my pain. I knew his pain. &lt;br /&gt;I knew our pain. &lt;br /&gt;He sparked a fire inside me I couldn’t put out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Crow &lt;br /&gt;I was strong. &lt;br /&gt;I was fearless. &lt;br /&gt;The biggest mistake my enemies could make would be to assume she was my weakness. &lt;br /&gt;Rylynn made me stronger, harder, and more determined to protect what was mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Friend or foe, I would never let another person get between us. No matter the risk, she was mine to have and hold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We were connected in pain, fueled in fire, and the world would test us, only to show we were sealed in strength. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, nothing could keep us apart. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One night to drown all the pain is all it’s supposed to be … or so we thought. We were wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Secrets, lies and betrayal changes both of our lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocky. Self-assured. Confident. Skilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crow is the President of the Ravage Motorcycle Club Rebellion Chapter—my father Rhys’ MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way Crow commands the space is all alpha bad boy biker. He’s enthralling. But it’s more than that. Somehow he grips that broken part of me that weeps for the loss of my grandfather. He is my solace when all is lost, the only person who can calm my soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This second chance encounter ignites an already growing desire. It explodes into passion neither of us anticipated. The connection is too strong to ignore. I wasn’t the only one in agony. Our lives intertwined in a way neither of us expected. We’re connected in pain, bound by family loyalty, and consumed with lust. But he’s, forbidden, because he’s much older—which makes him even hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I choose wrong, I’ll lose the one thing I’ve always had—respect within the Sumner Ravage MC. I’ll lose my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>This is the 6th book in the Ravage MC Bound series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lennox “Nox” Cruz can’t turn his back. No matter the collateral damage, he can’t walk away. He simply isn’t that kind of man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carsyn Devero is in too deep. The skeletons in her closet come out daily to remind her of the past she can’t escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter brings a boy who is now a man back into her world. As much as she knows she needs to walk away, Nox won’t let her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s stuck and doesn’t want to drag him down into her storm. He’s relentless and refuses to let her fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re bound by the wreckage, only holding onto hope no one else will go down with them. With Ravage MC at his back, will they find their way out to a future together?</description>

  <description>Jak, a former Navy SEAL, retired from the Navy and is returning home after two decades of secret missions. He is a decorated war hero with several Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star, and the Silver Star. During war, Jak risked everything for the mission. Now attempting to adjust to civilian life, Jak merely wants live life without incident. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karter finds herself in a psychological evaluation ordered by the court...once again. Emancipated from her mother at 16, Karter has been on her own since. Her mother, however, continues to haunt her by filing paperwork ordering her evaluation. Karter is the type of woman who takes no sh*t from anyone and simply wishes to be left to painting abstract art in her loft. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an odd series of circumstances causes the two to meet, Karter and Jak both question just what it is they're experiencing. A decade and a half separate them in age, but their time together seems to be seamless and without effort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there's something Karter isn't telling Jak. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when the secrets begin to unfold, Jak begins an investigation of his own which unveils a past that just might crush him.</description>

  <description>Must Read: Hopelessly Shattered previously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pregnant- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Single mother of two - ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Biker best friend – ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Ex that’s still a D-Bag – ✔ ✔ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New Years is the time for new beginnings. I thought I’d gotten that when I visited Texas over Thanksgiving. Then again, very little has changed. I’m still a librarian living in the same house. My daughters are growing up fast. Sure, I’ve acquired a new best friend, who’s convinced me it’s time to give dating fair shot. Which isn’t exactly easy when I’m pregnant with an As*hole’s baby. Does that complicate matters? Sorta. But there’s nothing left for me to do except move on. The jagged edges of my shattered heart have been polished, questions answered, and blank holes from my past plugged. Now I’m ready to take the plunge into uncharted waters to build a happier life… until a bomb comes along and tests my strength like never before. Nobody fu*ks with my family and gets away with it. Not even you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Proceed with caution. Contains adult sexual content, the excessive use of the F bomb, violence, and whatever else that makes it unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Not a stand-alone, 2nd book in a Trilogy.* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Single Mother- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Dead Father- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Motherless Childhood- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Librarian- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;Black Rimmed Glasses to Fit the Job Description- ✔ &lt;br /&gt;The Biggest A-hole in the World for an Ex- ✔✔ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you’re born you never know what life will throw at you. You just make the best of it no matter what happens. That’s pretty much been my go-to since infancy. Then the charming, bald headed, blue eyed, Brent came along and I thought all the suck in life had been flushed down the drain. Ha! That’s when my true journey began—motherhood. &lt;br /&gt;This is my story, on how I took life by the go-nads when I decided I needed closure from my past—my father’s sudden death in particular. But what happens next wasn't anything I expected… It’s hopeless… shattering….exciting … scary…joyful…priceless… and I owe it all to one man... Bear, a chapter president of the Sacred Sinners Motorcycle Club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains adult sexual content, the excessive use of the F-word, cheating, and whatever else that makes it unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1st Novel in a Duology - that could also be read as a possible standalone.</description>

  <description>This is a novella tying up the SEALs of Steel series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A prosthetic design engineer, Kat Greenwald is in love with Badger Horley. The former SEALs team leader is the love of her life. But she's seen and heard firsthand of the fears and commitment issues Badger and his closest friends--once part of Navy special operations teams--struggle with on a daily basis. During their weekly get-togethers, the women in love with these former SEALs open up to each other about their longing to tie the knot and start families. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;More than two years ago, Badger was badly injured after the truck his eight-man unit were in hit an antitank landmine. While he and his team have finally discovered the truth behind that devastating set-up, Badger sees the reality of his precarious future. His health could decline at any moment and he wants Kat to know exactly where the door to get out is if and when it does. The last thing he wants to do is invite pity, especially where the woman he loves is concerned. In a perfect world, he would have proposed to her the day they met. In the world he lives in, he can only conclude that harboring fears are always better than regrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Kat isn't the type of woman to fear hard times and she's willing to take a leap of faith as far out into the unknown as she can get if it means her most fervent wish comes true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Inmate 606, and brother of the Bayou Devils MC, Noah LeBlanc only wants two things - his freedom and his girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sixth grade, he met Kady Sinclair, the girl of his dreams. She was smart as a whip and challenged him at every turn and Noah wasted no time in winning her heart. They were inseparable until the club got in the way. A jealous competitor, carelessness and his own ambition cost him everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after being released from prison, he's determined to rebuild his life and find the one girl who has always owned his heart. The problem is no one has heard a word from her in seven long years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was before Noah joined the hunt.</description>

  <description>ERIC MITCHELL'S STORY&lt;br /&gt;I'm the bastard child, son to the mistress, my father's backup heir to the Mitchell empire. He sent me to Harvard. I left and became a Navy SEAL, but I'm back now, and I finished school on my own dime. I'm now the right hand man to Grayson Bennett, the billionaire who runs the Bennett Empire. I'm now a few months from being a billionaire myself. I don't need my father's company or his love. My "brother" can have it. I will never go back there. I will never be the mistake my father made, the way he was the mistake my mother made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she walks in the door, the princess I'd once wanted more than I'd wanted my father's love. She wants me to come back. She says my father needs to be saved. I don't want to save my father but I do want her. Deeply. Passionately. More than I want anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she's The Princess and I'm The Bastard. We don't fit. We don't belong together and yet she says he needs me, that she needs me. We're like sugar and spice, we don't mix, but I really crave a taste. Just one. What harm can just one taste do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't miss the full FILTHY TRILOGY:&lt;br /&gt;THE BASTARD&lt;br /&gt;THE PRINCESS (January)&lt;br /&gt;The Empire (March&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The Bastard was originally titled Dirty Rich Bastard. Long story short, as I was nearing the end of The Princess, I realized I can't possibly end Eric and Harper's story with this book. It would be unfair to my readers to be shortchanged on their ending. So I made the decision to make their story three books instead of two. I hope you'll understand and be excited for the remaining two books in their story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;These three books can be read independently of the Dirty Rich series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Tallulah Douglas is starting over. She’s left her abusive husband behind in California and is building a new life for herself and her teenage daughter in the North Georgia mountains. Between working at her family’s vintage shop, volunteering at the local legal aid office, and avoiding the scrutiny of the town’s Gossip Brigade, dating is the last thing on Tally’s mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only two things are worthy of Robert McFerrin’s attention: his eight-year-old daughter and his fledgling distillery business. He just wants to keep his head down and live his life, but unfortunately, memories are long in Hemlock Creek and getting a fresh start is easier said than done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A captured bouquet and too much muscadine wine sends Tally into Rob’s arms, and smarmy suitor makes her stay there. Can a fake relationship develop into something more? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Three brothers, three second chance romances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meet Nolan, Cal, and Tobias Harper, three brothers who are starting over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CLINCHER: &lt;br /&gt;Ever since his heart attack, Nolan Harper is playing it safe–afraid to really start living again. Turning in his high stress restaurant career for a desk job drains the zest right out of him. Five years ago, Bridget Doherty walked away from a promising MMA career in order to salvage her failing marriage. Now, newly divorced, Bridget is training again with hopes that a new gym in a new city will reignite her passion–both personally and professionally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Bridget steps in as Nolan’s personal trainer, the fast-talking girl fighter from Southie intrigues the gentle Southern giant. These opposites definitely attract. But will Bridget and Nolan's pasts smother the fire that burns between them? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WHISKEY AND SERENDIPITY &lt;br /&gt;Nothing is going right for Kate Fahey, a forty-two-year-old risk analyst, on her last-minute business trip to Ireland. From one screwup to another, the trip has the potential to be an unmitigated disaster. The handsome Southern gentleman she meets on the flight provides a welcome distraction from her very bad day, but in her rush to a get to a meeting, she leaves the plane before she can turn her flirtation into something more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forty-five, fresh from a divorce and recently unemployed, Cal Harper decides to go on what should have been a delayed honeymoon to Ireland alone. Cal only wants the comfort found at the bottom of a bottle. Even hungover after a trans-Atlantic flight, he knows it was a mistake not to make future plans with the beautiful woman who sat next to him the entire time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the luck of the Irish brings the two strangers back together, they throw caution to the wind and agree to a wild, holiday fling. Will their short time together be enough? Or will they be forced to go back to their separate lives when they return to the US? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SOUNDS AND SPIRITS &lt;br /&gt;Forty-eight-year-old Liddie Hopewell doesn’t quite know what to do with herself after her husband passes away after a long illness. When one of her beloved uncles encourages her to come back to Hemlock Creek, she heads home, with her daughter and granddaughter in tow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tobias Harper moved back to north Georgia after three decades in Nashville, hoping to recharge and regroup. A successful musician and songwriter, Tobias is searching for inspiration but a vindictive ex-wife and the ghost of his overbearing father seem to be all he’s finding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;High school sweethearts more than three decades before, Liddie and Tobias have a chance meeting at the local tavern. A second unexpected encounter leads to answers of long-unresolved questions. Will Liddie and Tobias be able to rebuild the relationship they once had, or will the burden of the past prove to be too much for their newly-rekindled love affair to bear? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(These three contemporary romances have been previously published in the DS Fight Club series, and in the Hemlock Creek series.)</description>

A successful musician and songwriter, Tobias is searching for inspiration but a vindictive ex-wife and the ghost of his overbearing father seem to be all he’s finding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High school sweethearts more than three decades before, Liddie and Tobias have a chance meeting at the local tavern. A second unexpected encounter leads to answers of long-unresolved questions. Will Liddie and Tobias be able to rebuild the relationship they once had, or will the burden of the past prove to be too much for their newly-rekindled love affair to bear?</description>

  <description>Nothing is going right for Kate Fahey, a forty-two-year-old risk analyst, on her last-minute business trip to Ireland. From one screwup to another, the trip has the potential to be an unmitigated disaster. The handsome Southern gentleman she meets on the flight provides a welcome distraction from her very bad day, but in her rush to a get to a meeting, she leaves the plane before she can turn her flirtation into something more.&lt;br /&gt;Forty-five, fresh from a divorce and recently unemployed, Cal Harper decides to go on what should have been a delayed honeymoon to Ireland alone. Cal only wants the comfort found at the bottom of a bottle. Even hungover after a trans-Atlantic flight, he knows it was a mistake not to make future plans with the beautiful woman who sat next to him the entire time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the luck of the Irish brings the two strangers back together, they throw caution to the wind and agree to a wild, holiday fling. Will their short time together be enough? Or will they be forced to go back to their separate lives when they return to the US?</description>

  <description>Rising Hollywood star Summer Arden never in her wildest dreams imagined at forty she would be trading in her apron and coffee pot for movie scripts and makeup chairs. But just when she starts enjoying the perks of her new life, fate shakes things up again and her world is submerged in turmoil. Summer finds herself in need of a real-life leading man, one who can protect her. Save her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Private sector warrior Mike Wade's job for the Security Six team is all he knows. Protect and serve has been his lifelong motto. When his childhood friend finds herself in a world of trouble, he enlists his team to protect the one woman who's always had a place in his heart. Blurring the lines between duty and desire is playing with fire. As danger rises, Mike realizes he'll do anything to save Summer--even if it costs him everything. &lt;br /&gt;​ &lt;br /&gt;** Please note: Saving Summer was previously released in a Kindle World. The rights have been reverted back to Tiffani. She combined A Taste of Summer to Saving Summer and has added new content to the story. It's a must read!</description>

A confident and stylish professional, she is the youngest owner of a seaside multimillion-dollar real estate agency. But no amount of money could evict her demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falcon Grey’s military training has given him an edge to take down the enemy no matter where they hide.

There is only one woman who kept him at arm's length, and she’s the one he can’t forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a visit to Sin City promises Falcon the welcome cocktail of business and pleasure the last bet he would have placed would have been on running into Paige—and what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Four of The IMPERFECTION Series</description>

  <description>Formerly titled Selective Memory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Aria Cole, Declan Sinclair has found his perfect woman. Her beauty isn’t at all what the fashion industry dictates. It radiates from her heart to her beautiful blue eyes and luscious curves. He would sacrifice anything for her, except his pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love isn’t blind to Aria, in fact, her vision is perfectly clear. Looking past Declan’s drop-dead gorgeous exterior, she sees the genuine man inside. The man whose life she would happily share if only he would stop tripping over his arrogance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Declan and Aria aren’t the only two complicating their relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;International supermodel Marisol Franzi believes that Declan is more to her than just a business counterpart. She has no intention of losing him to a “plain Jane,” even if she destroys them all in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the conclusion to NO PERFECT MAN, NO PERFECT TIME will leave you breathless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Two of The IMPERFECTION Series</description>

  <description>Formerly titled Here Now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t the life that Carter Sinclair had envisioned for himself. He's too young to be a widower, and too old a soul to start over in the love department. The only thing left for him is work. As the CEO of MarSin Falcon Security he sets out to fix what’s broken in the system. What he can't fix is his personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A foster child from a young age, Aimee Vincent is the fashion industry's newest darling. Catapulted into the spotlight, her image fills television screens and graces the covers of magazines. Money is no longer a problem, but there isn't enough cash in the world to buy what she truly craves—the security that only comes from being part of a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a friend of Carter’s brother, Aimee plans an impromptu visit when she arrives in town. There's a pain in Carter's eyes that Aimee recognizes. The kind of pain that haunts the lost souls. She feels a magnetic pull, but does he? Determined to find out, Aimee seizes the moment, but sometimes living in the present poses its own danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Three of The IMPERFECTION Series</description>

  <description>Formerly titled Positive Negativity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the press, Declan Sinclair has it all – and he’s had enough. After a decade in the fast-paced, image-driven, modeling scene he needs a change of pace. Escaping to his seaside home gives him a place to sort his thoughts and gain some clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria Cole has built a successful renovation business. With the help of her father, she has learned that the only thing limiting a woman is her belief in herself. But what happens when the person she leans on the most is no longer there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aria struggles over the death of her father, she revisits the place of cherished memories. Daily walks beside the ocean offer the solace she so desperately seeks. When a freak thunderstorm causes her to cross paths with a handsome stranger, lightning isn’t the only electricity in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book One of The IMPERFECTION Series</description>

  <description>Saffron McNabb is living her best life. After abandoning corporate rat race almost twenty years before, Saffy’s happily managing a small bed and breakfast in the north Georgia mountains. That is, until the owner of the Creekside B &amp;amp; B wants to sell, and not to Saffy. &lt;br /&gt;Bruce Baird is in desperate need of a change. Bored both professionally and personally, when he’s forced to take vacation, the normally unadventurous actuary decides to throw caution to the wind. &lt;br /&gt;A close encounter with one of Saffy’s rescued animals leaves the tightly-wound man and the free-spirited woman at odds. But when reality intrudes on the odd couple, they find they have more in common than not, and maybe, just maybe, Saffy and Bruce actually make a perfect combination. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. … Chaos calms. … Crime quiets. … But does it really?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After getting involved in two murder cases in the short time she’s lived in picturesque Kelowna, divorcee and gardener Doreen Montgomery has developed a reputation almost as notorious as her Nan’s. The only way to stop people from speculating, is to live a life of unrelieved boredom until the media and the neighbors forget about her. And Doreen aims to do just that with a tour of Kelowna’s famed Carnation Gardens. Plants, more plants, and nothing whatsoever that anyone could object to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when she sees a fight between a beautiful young woman and her boyfriend, she can’t help but be concerned. Concerned enough that she follows the couple out of the parking lot and through town. And when gunshots interrupt the placid afternoon, it’s too late to worry about how her nemesis, Corporal Mack Moreau, will feel about her getting involved in yet another of his cases. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With bodies turning up in the carnations, and a connection to a cold case of a missing child from long ago, Doreen has her hands full, not least with trying to keep her involvement in the investigations a secret from her Nan, Mack Moreau, and especially the media. But someone’s keeping up with Doreen’s doings… and that someone can’t afford for her to find the answers to the questions she’s asking.</description>

  <description>A psychotic kidnapper with a gun. A blindfolded ride to a ruthless drug dealer's compound. Torture. A slow death. These were the things that were waiting for me in the parkign lot while I worked the evening shift of what was sure to be my last day on earth. Then, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; came in for dinner.He had a loud Harley-Davidson, a dry sense of humor, a contagious laugh, and seven friends. All he wanted was an enchilada dinner. But. He was my only hope. So, I handed him his meal, gestured to the parking lot, and told him my story. As he sauntered toward the parking lot no differently than he would have walked into a bar, I wondered just who this man could be. Finding the answer to that question wasn't as easy as a person might think. But it was the best ride of my life. ATAND-ALONE, HEA, NO CHEATING, NO ABUSE</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. … Chaos continues. … Murders abound. … Honestly?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Doreen Montgomery’s new life in Kelowna was supposed to be a fresh start after a nasty split from her husband of fourteen years, plus a chance to get her bearings and her life back on track. Instead her first week in her new hometown was spent digging up dead bodies, chasing clues, and getting in Corporal Mack Moreau’s way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now that the old cold case has been solved, and the murderer brought to justice, Doreen believes things might go her way this week. When Mack hires her to whip his mother’s garden into shape, it seems like a second chance, both for Doreen’s new beginning in Kelowna and for her budding relationship with Mack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, instead of digging up Mrs. Moreau’s struggling begonias and planting them in a better location, Doreen discovers another set of bones … and another mystery to solve. As the clues pile up, Mack makes it abundantly clear that he doesn’t want or need her help, but Doreen can’t resist the lure of another whodunit. As she and Mack butt heads and chase red herrings, Doreen’s grandmother, Nan, sets odds and places bets on who solves the crime first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All while a murderer is watching …</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Riches to rags. … Controlling to chaos. … But murder … seriously?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After her ex-husband leaves her high and dry, former socialite Doreen Montgomery's chance at a new life comes in the form of her grandmother, Nan's, dilapidated old house in picturesque Kelowna … and the added job of caring for the animals Nan couldn’t take into assisted living with her: Thaddeus, the loquacious African gray parrot with a ripe vocabulary, and his buddy, Goliath, a monster-size cat with an equally monstrous attitude. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s the new start Doreen and her beloved basset hound, Mugs, desperately need. But, just as things start to look up for Doreen, Goliath the cat and Mugs the dog find a human finger in Nan’s overrun garden. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And not just a finger. Once the police start digging, the rest of the body turns up and turns out to be connected to an old unsolved crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her grandmother as the prime suspect, Doreen soon finds herself stumbling over clues and getting on Corporal Mack Moreau’s last nerve, as she does her best to prove her beloved Nan innocent of murder.</description>

  <description>Kaine Reynolds wants nothing more than solitude. After an unthinkable tragedy destroys his family, he’s cut off all ties to his former life so he can battle his grief the only way he knows how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Piper Campbell knocks on his door, rambling on about being his new neighbor, he slams the door in her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kaine’s gruff demeanor doesn’t scare her. She’s set on living in Montana and starting over after a terrible divorce. And she wouldn’t mind having a fling to chase away the pain of her husband’s betrayal. Her handsome, albeit rude, neighbor is the perfect candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet what neither of them suspect is that their no-strings affair will result in the surprise of Piper’s lifetime—and Kaine’s worst fear.</description>

  <description>Sofia Kendrick has always cherished her tiara. As the youngest daughter of a wealthy New York family, she’s lived the life of an American princess. But after two scandalous divorces and a breakup smear her name across the society rags, the shine from her crown has dulled. People call her superficial, even gaudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s nothing more than tinsel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for escape and starving for peace, Sofia heads to Montana for a holiday weekend with her brother. But she doesn’t get the relaxing vacation she planned. Instead, she’s put to work in a bar alongside Dakota Magee—a man who does not want her help. A man who is set on teaching her a few lessons about real life and hard work. But Sofia has a couple of life lessons of her own to teach. Like how to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words: 98,430</description>

The one man she desperately wants to take notice struggles to remember her name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Year after year, Willa stands by, watching as the bartender slash playboy drowns his demons in beer and sex. Then one night, he shows up at her door, suddenly aware that the girl he’s seen around Lark Cove is now a beautiful woman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except what he doesn’t remember is that this visit isn’t his first. They spent a night together once before. A night he’s forgotten, thanks to a bottle of tequila. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A night that crushed a timid girl’s heart, and set a broken man on the path to heal them both.</description>

  <description>This is a short piece written to introduce you to my characters, Kyle and Christy. It is a small investment of time and money on your part, like the first course to a much larger meal.&lt;br /&gt;This is a private glimpse into the hearts and minds of these fictional SEALs, their community, and the women who are lucky enough to be loved by them. Their brotherhood, loyalty and mission to protect and defend, sometimes at great personal cost, is what makes them heroes. They do so quietly, not seeking public recognition.&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy this piece, I hope that you will continue along the journey in my full length novel, Accidental SEAL, and read how these two get together, and fight dangers that threaten to keep them apart.&lt;br /&gt;Christy and Kyle meet quite by accident in the very first chapter, and not in any way you could predict. But rest assured, they will find themselves together at the end in an intense and passionate relationship on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy their story.</description>

  <description>Special Operator Nick Dunn gets the call he has been dreading since before his last deployment. His sister is in her final stages of cancer. He and his Team 3 roommate drive up to Sonoma County from Coronado to help her shut down her failing nursery business and tie up her final affairs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick only vaguely remembers Devon Brandeburg, his sister’s best friend, but boy has she grown up. Last time he saw her was five years ago when he graduated BUD/s and completed SEAL qualification to obtain his Trident. Sparks begin to fly between the two of them, but not in the normal way for Nick. The woman wants nothing to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devon Brandeburg has created a small financial fortune through her success in real estate. Her career is her main focus, but a closely guarded secret is her total lack of experience with men. After all, who needs them? Especially when their testosterone-stuffed egos suck all the air out of the room, like Nick’s does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick’s sister requires two things of the both of them as her dying wish. 1. Nick and Devon must find a buyer for the nursery together, not allowing to her nasty winery owner neighbor next door to get his hands on her piece of heaven. 2. They date at least five times before she passes on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts as a deathbed promise turns out to be a hot affair neither one expected. Nick becomes Devon’s teacher in her journey to womanhood. As she comes alive in his arms, the student brings the teacher something he’s never allowed himself to want, and now knows he needs.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28798550-seal-under-covers" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Armando Guzman has just returned from a difficult tour in Afghanistan only to find his sister still making choices that land her in the company of a San Diego drug gang. Vowing he will save her from the bad environment she has placed herself in, he is blindsided by his sister’s hotter-than-hot best friend, Gina.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Gina Mancuso is working her first under cover detail, trying to prove herself on a male-dominated police force, even if it means she has to work side by side with the SDPD officer with whom she had a brief, abusive relationship. She is not prepared for the chemical attraction that slams her against the hard body of her subject’s Navy SEAL brother, Armando. Their hot affair not only threatens to ruin her mission, but could engulf Armando in a career-ending dispute with local law enforcement.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Armando is unwilling to walk away from his sister, especially as tensions rise between he and Gina’s ex-lover. Gina is in a race for time to keep her secret identity from the man she is now sure she loves with all her heart. But will she have to sacrifice their relationship in order to accomplish the mission she was sent to do?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28798500-fallen-seal-legacy" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nebraska born and bred Navy SEAL Calvin “Coop” Cooper, after his own family has perished in a tornado, is ordered to meet the family of a prominent San Diego psychiatrist. The doctor’s brother is a fallen SEAL medic who died in Grenada. There, Cooper meets Libby Brownlee, the beautiful niece of this fallen hero. Heavily influenced by her father, “We don’t speak military here,” is her comment about the military in general, and the SEAL community in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts out as a frosty debate between two people privately dealing with their own personal grief, turns into a passionate affair neither expected. Just as Cooper realizes perhaps Libby is the woman he’s always been looking for, she is snatched out from under him by a psychopathic killer bent on revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Brownlee is forced to rely on Cooper’s help, along with his buddies in SEAL Team 3. Will Cooper be able to survive the loss of the woman he loves, or will his self sacrifice be enough to keep her safe?</description>

  <description>Christy Nelson embarks on her new career in Real Estate by holding her first open house. Entering the wrong house, by accident, she finds the nude sleeping body of a young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Kyle Lansdowne, on a mission to find his AWOL Team buddy, is staying at his buddy’s home while investigating the disappearance. When someone breaks in, he takes protective measures. He doesn’t expect to find that a beautiful young woman is responsible for his teammate’s abduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts out as a meeting by accident becomes a hot affair neither one is ready for. Kyle is conflicted about getting Christy involved in his mission, but his hand is forced when he learns the same San Diego gang responsible for his teammate’s abduction has kidnapped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battling a cadre of dirty law enforcements hell-bent on getting military equipment, especially state-of-the-art firepower, Kyle is forced to admit that he would die to protect her.</description>
