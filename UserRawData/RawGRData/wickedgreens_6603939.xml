Until Nameless arrives—a vigilante whose past is a mystery and whose future is written in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who crosses Sheriff Russell Soakes is dead, missing, or warned. One of them is a single mother trying to protect her children but bracing herself for the worst. Nameless fears the outcome. He’s seen it in his visions. Now it’s time to teach the depraved Soakes a lesson in fear. But in turning predators into prey, will Nameless unearth a few secrets of his own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From #1&lt;/i&gt; New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author Dean Koontz comes&lt;/i&gt; In the Heart of the Fire&lt;i&gt;, part of&lt;/i&gt; Nameless&lt;i&gt;, a riveting collection of short stories about a vigilante nomad, stripped of his memories and commissioned to kill. Follow him in each story, which can be read or listened to in a single sitting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A highly infectious, deadly virus from the central African rain forest suddenly appears in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic "hot" virus. &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone&lt;/i&gt; tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the appearance of rare and lethal viruses and their "crashes" into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone&lt;/i&gt; proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The 2013-2014 Ebola epidemic was the deadliest ever--but the outbreaks continue. Now comes a gripping account of the doctors and scientists fighting to protect us, an urgent wake-up call about the future of emerging viruses--from the #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone, &lt;/i&gt;soon to be a National Geographic original miniseries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, Ebola started with a two-year-old child who likely had contact with a wild creature and whose entire family quickly fell ill and died. The ensuing global drama activated health professionals in North America, Europe, and Africa in a desperate race against time to contain the viral wildfire. By the end--as the virus mutated into its deadliest form, and spread farther and faster than ever before--30,000 people would be infected, and the dead would be spread across eight countries on three continents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this taut and suspenseful medical drama, Richard Preston deeply chronicles the outbreak, in which we saw for the first time the specter of Ebola jumping continents, crossing the Atlantic, and infecting people in America. Rich in characters and conflict--physical, emotional, and ethical--&lt;i&gt;Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; is an immersion in one of the great public health calamities of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston writes of doctors and nurses in the field putting their own lives on the line, of government bureaucrats and NGO administrators moving, often fitfully, to try to contain the outbreak, and of pharmaceutical companies racing to develop drugs to combat the virus. He also explores the charged ethical dilemma over who should and did receive the rare doses of an experimental treatment when they became available at the peak of the disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; makes clear that the outbreak of 2013-2014 is a harbinger of further, more severe outbreaks, and of emerging viruses heretofore unimagined--in any country, on any continent. In our ever more interconnected world, with roads and towns cut deep into the jungles of equatorial Africa, viruses both familiar and undiscovered are being unleashed into more densely populated areas than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more we discover about the virosphere, the more we realize its deadly potential. &lt;i&gt;Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; is an exquisitely timely book, a stark warning of viral outbreaks to come.</description>

  <description>When twelve-year-old Cady Bennett is sent to live with the aunt she didn’t even know she had in the quaint mountain town of Julian, she doesn’t know what to expect. Cady isn’t used to stability, or even living inside, after growing up homeless in San Diego with her dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s staying in her mother’s old room, exploring the countryside filled with apple orchards and pie shops, making friends, and working in Aunt Shell’s own pie shop—and soon, Cady starts to feel like she belongs. Then she finds out that Aunt Shell’s pie shop is failing. Saving the business and protecting the first place she’s ever really felt safe will take everything she’s learned and the help of all her new friends. But are there some things even the perfect pie just can’t fix?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the wildly popular MacLean Curse series crafts a charming and evocative story about a picturesque Southern town, two fiercely independent women, and a magical friendship that will change their lives forever. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The residents of Dove Pond, North Carolina, know three things: they have the finest bar-b-que this side of Atlanta, their Apple Festival is the best that ever was, and the town has phenomenal good luck whenever the Dove family has seven daughters. Fortunately, that time is now, because Dove Pond desperately needs a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seventh daughter, Sarah Dove, believes in all things magical. Books have whispered their secrets to her since she was a child. Now the town librarian, she makes sure every book finds the reader who most needs it. But recently the books have been whispering something different—that change is about to come to Dove Pond. Sarah is soon convinced that the legendary Dove Pond good luck has arrived in the form of new resident, Grace Wheeler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tragic death of her sister, Grace has moved to Dove Pond with her grieving young niece and ailing foster mother hoping to retrench financially and emotionally before returning to her fast-paced city life. But she soon learns that life in a not-so-sleepy town isn’t as quiet as she’d hoped. Despite her best efforts to focus on her family, she can’t avoid the townspeople, especially her next-door neighbors, the quirky and talkative Sarah Dove and cynical veteran Travis Parker. Grace’s situation grows more complicated when she assumes her duties as town clerk and discovers that Dove Pond is on the verge of financial ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already overburdened by her own cares, Grace tries to stay aloof from the town’s issues, but she’s never been good at resisting a challenge. With Sarah’s encouragement, and inspired by the wise words of a special book, Grace decides to save her new town. And in her quest, she discovers the rich comfort of being a part of a loving community, the tantalizing promise of new love, the deep strength that comes from having a true friend, and the heartfelt power of finding just the right book.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Stephanie Plum's career has taken more wrong turns than a student driver on the Jersey Turnpike, and her love life is a hopeless tangle. In order to save someone dear to her, she'll have to straighten things out in &lt;i&gt;Twisted Twenty-Six &lt;/i&gt;the latest, novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Janet Evanovich.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma Mazur is a widow...again. This time her marriage lasted a whole 45 minutes. The unlucky groom was one Jimmy Rosolli, local gangster, lothario (senior division) and heart attack waiting to happen...well, the waiting's over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a sad day, but if she can't have Jimmy at least Grandma can have all the attention she wants as the dutiful widow. But some kinds of attention are not welcomed, particularly when Jimmy's former "business partners" are convinced that his widow is keeping the keys to their financial success for herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has spent an entire career finding bad guys, a set of missing keys should be no challenge for Stephanie Plum. Problem is, the facts are as twisted as a boardwalk pretzel with mustard.</description>

  <description>In the small north Florida town of Seabrook, a young lawyer named Keith Russo was shot dead at his desk as he worked late one night. The killer left no clues behind. There were no witnesses, no real suspects, no one with a motive. The police soon settled on Quincy Miller, a young black man who was once a client of Russo’s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quincy was framed, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison with no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. Then he wrote a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small innocence group founded by a lawyer/minister named Cullen Post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardian handles only a few innocence cases at a time, and Post is its only investigator. He travels the South fighting wrongful convictions and taking cases no one else will touch. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy exonerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another one without a second thought.</description>

  <description>The only legitimate child of Lord Byron, the most brilliant, revered, and scandalous of the Romantic poets, Ada was destined for fame long before her birth. Estranged from Ada’s father, who was infamously “mad, bad, and dangerous to know,” Ada’s mathematician mother is determined to save her only child from her perilous Byron heritage. Banishing fairy tales and make-believe from the nursery, Ada’s mother provides her daughter with a rigorous education grounded in mathematics and science. Any troubling spark of imagination—or worse yet, passion or poetry—is promptly extinguished. Or so her mother believes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ada is introduced into London society as a highly eligible young heiress, she at last discovers the intellectual and social circles she has craved all her life. Little does she realize that her delightful new friendship with inventor Charles Babbage—brilliant, charming, and occasionally curmudgeonly—will shape her destiny. Intrigued by the prototype of his first calculating machine, the Difference Engine, and enthralled by the plans for his even more advanced Analytical Engine, Ada resolves to help Babbage realize his extraordinary vision, unique in her understanding of how his invention could transform the world. All the while, she passionately studies mathematics—ignoring skeptics who consider it an unusual, even unhealthy pursuit for a woman—falls in love, discovers the shocking secrets behind her parents’ estrangement, and comes to terms with the unquenchable fire of her imagination.</description>

And in-laws to die for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gemma Robinson comes into Elliot’s life like a whirlwind, and they marry and settle into his home. When she asks him if her parents can come to stay for a couple of weeks, he is keen to oblige – he just doesn’t quite know what he’s signing up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Robinsons arrive with Gemma’s sister, Chloe, a mysterious young woman who refuses to speak or leave her room. Elliot starts to suspect that the Robinsons are hiding a dark secret. And then there are the scars on his wife’s body that she won’t talk about . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Elliot’s in-laws become more comfortable in his home, encroaching on all aspects of his life, it becomes clear that they have no intention of moving out. To protect Gemma, and their marriage, Elliot delves into the Robinsons’ past. But is he prepared for the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government’s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, &lt;i&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/i&gt; is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, &lt;i&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Tuscan Child &lt;/i&gt;comes a beautiful and heart-rending novel of a woman’s love and sacrifice during the First World War.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Great War continues to take its toll, headstrong twenty-one-year-old Emily Bryce is determined to contribute to the war effort. She is convinced by a cheeky and handsome Australian pilot that she can do more, and it is not long before she falls in love with him and accepts his proposal of marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he is sent back to the front, Emily volunteers as a “land girl,” tending to the neglected grounds of a large Devonshire estate. It’s here that Emily discovers the long-forgotten journals of a medicine woman who devoted her life to her herbal garden. The journals inspire Emily, and in the wake of devastating news, they are her saving grace. Emily’s lover has not only died a hero but has left her terrified—and with child. Since no one knows that Emily was never married, she adopts the charade of a war widow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Emily learns more about the volatile power of healing with herbs, the found journals will bring her to the brink of disaster, but may open a path to her destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The first in the groundbreaking Nora Kelly series from #1 bestselling authors Preston &amp;amp; Child blends the legend of the Donner party with a riveting suspense tale, taking the dynamic duo's work to new heights.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nora Kelly, a young but successful curator with a series of important excavations already under her belt, is approached by the handsome Historian, Clive Benton, to lead an expedition unlike any other. Clive tells his story--one involving the ill-fated Donner Party, who became permanently lodged in the American consciousness in the winter of 1847, when the first skeletonized survivors of the party stumbled out of the California mountains, replete with tales of courage, resourcefulness, bad luck, murder, barbarism--and, finally, starvation and cannibalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captivated by the Donner Party, Nora agrees and they venture into the Sierra Nevada in search of the camp. Quickly, they learn that the discovery of the missing starvation camp is just the tip of the iceberg--and that the real truth behind those long-dead pioneers is not only far more complex and surprising than they could have imagined...but it is one that puts them both in mortal danger from a very real, present-day threat in which the search for the lost party, and its fabled fortune in gold, are merely means to a horrifying end.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Ruth Cardello’s sexy and emotional romance, a billionaire dares to invest in the riskiest proposition of his life: a second chance at love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mom Heather Ellis would do anything for her adopted daughter, Ava. Even post an online reward for anyone who found the girl’s lost stuffed animal. Who’d have guessed it’d be returned by a drop-dead-sexy man with such sadness in his eyes that she had to reach out to him? To Ava, he’s a hero. To Heather, he’s a fantasy that puts at risk the happy life she’s made for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been five years since billionaire developer Sebastian Romano lost his wife and unborn child in a tragic accident. Now he’s all business. No room for emotion. Until he stumbles across that damn stuffed wolf and the beautiful single mother looking for it. Is he ready to give love a second chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s more to Sebastian, his family, and his past than Heather knows. More than even Sebastian knows. Will the life they build together be challenged when the truth is finally revealed?</description>

  <description>Audio is the up-and-coming market, but the price of entry can be a horrific $300-500 per finished hour and up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;M. L. Buchman has recorded and published over 30 audio titles—himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here he covers the basics you need to record your own audiobooks. &lt;br /&gt;• How to decide if it’s the best option. &lt;br /&gt;• When you should outsource the engineering. &lt;br /&gt;• Why you’re wrong when you “hate your own voice.” &lt;br /&gt;• Tools, techniques, and free studio space ideas. &lt;br /&gt;• A step-by-step guide to recording and engineering your own audiobook. &lt;br /&gt;• How to quantify direct, and most importantly of all, indirect costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This simplified guide delivers the confidence to tackle the unique opportunity of “Read by Author.” &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;The Dog Stars&lt;/i&gt;, the story of two college friends on a wilderness canoe trip—a gripping novel of a friendship tested by fire, white water, and violence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wynn and Jack have been best friends since freshman orientation, bonded by their shared love of mountains, books, and fishing. Wynn is a gentle giant, a Vermont kid never happier than when his feet are in the water. Jack is more rugged, raised on a ranch in Colorado where sleeping under the stars and cooking on a fire came as naturally to him as breathing. When they decide to canoe the Maskwa River in northern Canada, they anticipate long days of leisurely paddling and picking blueberries, and nights of stargazing and reading paperback Westerns. But a wildfire making its way across the forest adds unexpected urgency to the journey. When they hear a man and woman arguing on the fog-shrouded riverbank and decide to warn them about the fire, their search for the pair turns up nothing and no one. But: The next day a man appears on the river, paddling alone. Is this the man they heard? And, if he is, where is the woman? From this charged beginning, master storyteller Peter Heller unspools a headlong, heart-pounding tale of desperate wilderness survival.</description>

  <description>They died with smiles on their faces. Three apparent suicides: a brilliant engineer, an infamous lawyer, and a controversial politician. Three strangers with nothing in common - and no obvious reasons for killing themselves. Lieutenant Eve Dallas found the deaths suspicious. And her instincts paid off when autopsies revealed small burns on the brains of the victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it a genetic abnormality or a high-tech method of murder? Eve's investigation turned to the provocative world of virtual-reality games - where the same techniques used to create joy and desire could also prompt the mind to become the weapon of its own destruction...</description>

  <description>In 1948, a film star sees a strange man in her photos. &lt;br /&gt;In 2019, a writer sees a strange woman in his photos. &lt;br /&gt;Film star and writer occupy the same beach house—71 years apart. &lt;br /&gt;In an extraordinary moment, they meet face-to-face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hypnotic, original and intrepid. This story grabs you from the first page and never lets go. &lt;br /&gt;—Peggy-Anne Lawford &lt;br /&gt;Perfect Word Book Blog &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rita Randall, a celebrated film noir actress in 1948, leaves LA after a fatal confrontation. Clint West is a best-selling author in 2019, struggling to move on after the death of his wife. Rita and Clint travel to Long Island, New York and occupy the same beach house—seventy-one years apart. &lt;br /&gt;When Rita appears in the background of Clint’s recent cell phone photos, he’s mystified. When Clint appears in Rita’s photos, she’s troubled and confused. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clint investigates and learns about secret time travel experiments that were conducted in the area during the 1940s. Clint meets Oscar, a 95-year-old physicist, who had worked for the military in the 1940s and who had time traveled himself, using time portals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During a thunderstorm, Rita wanders the beach. When she sees a rolling blue, misty wave charging toward her, she pivots and darts away. But there is no escape and she is swallowed, tossed and propelled forward into the future—to 2019. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rita and Clint meet face-to-face, and their lives are changed forever.</description>

  <description>Heartbroken and hoping for a new start, Abi Howes takes a summer job in rural France at the Château Bellevue. The old château echoes with voices from the past, and soon Abi finds herself drawn to one remarkable woman’s story, a story that could change the course of her summer—and her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1938, Eliane Martin tends beehives in the garden of the beautiful Château Bellevue. In its shadow she meets Mathieu Dubosq and falls in love for the first time, daring to hope that a happy future awaits. But France’s eastern border is darkening under the clouds of war, and history has other plans for Eliane…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she is separated from Mathieu in the chaos of German occupation, Eliane makes the dangerous decision to join the Resistance and fight for France’s liberty. But with no end to the war in sight, her loyalty to Mathieu is severely tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of Sea of Memories comes the story of two remarkable women, generations apart, who must use adversity to their advantage and find the resilience deep within.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The lives of two women, generations apart, converge in this enthralling novel of love, mystery, memories, and secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pregnant and still grieving the death of her fiancé, historian Megan Buchanan is forging ahead on a dream project: to restore to its original glory the landmark hunting lodge her own great-great-grandfather built on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. With the help of her fiancé’s caring best friend, it’s sure to draw much-needed tourist revenue to Cape Hudson, a town rich in southern history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it’s Spring House, the caretaker’s cottage on the grounds, that holds the most intriguing history for Megan. In a cache of old letters, she’s drawn into the captivating life of a young woman who embarked on her own dream adventure a century ago. With each one, Megan is swept away into her enthralling world—and all its secrets. But Megan has secrets too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as one woman’s past unfolds in each revealing letter, Megan will discover more about herself and about the emotional tides of family that can be weathered with those you love and trust the most.</description>

  <description>Eliza Roth and her sister Sophie co-own a jewelry shop in Brooklyn. One night, after learning of an ex’s engagement, Eliza accidentally posts a photo of herself wearing a diamond ring on &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; finger to her Instagram account beloved by 100,000 followers. Sales skyrocket, press rolls in, and Eliza learns that her personal life is good for business. So she has a choice: continue the ruse or clear up the misunderstanding. With mounting financial pressure, Eliza sets off to find a fake fiancé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fellow entrepreneur Blake seems like the perfect match on paper. And in real life he shows promise, too. He would be perfect, if only Eliza didn’t feel also drawn to someone else. But Blake doesn’t know Eliza is “engaged”; Sophie asks Eliza for an impossible sum of money; and Eliza’s lies start to spiral out of control. She can either stay engaged online or fall in love in real life.</description>

  <description>Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the deep South to dangerously utopic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures.</description>

  <description>At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of five decades, &lt;i&gt;The Dutch House&lt;/i&gt; is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.</description>

  <description>October 1815: There is only one place Kendra Donovan wants to travel—back to her own time period in the twenty-first century. But since that’s not happening, she agrees instead to travel with her new guardian, the Duke of Aldridge, to one of his smaller estates in Lancashire. Their journey takes them through Yorkshire, a region whose breathtaking beauty masks a simmering violence brought on by the Industrial Revolution, which pits mill owner against worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kendra and the Duke encounter a band of Luddites on a lonely, fog-shrouded road, the Duke informs the authorities in the nearby village of East Dingleford that mischief may have been done at the local mill. However, it isn’t just mischief but murder that is discovered, when the body of the mill manager, Mr. Stone, is found brutally bludgeoned to death in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Constable is certain the radical-minded Luddites committed the murder. One look at the crime scene and Kendra knows they did not, prompting the Duke to shock the locals by volunteering their services to catch the real killer. Joined by lover Alec and Bow Street Runner Sam Kelly, Kendra must sort through the puzzle of Stone’s rather unsavory life, picking apart alibies and dissecting carefully created deceptions from a growing list of suspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a special agent for the FBI, Kendra thought she’d encountered every kind of evil. But when another, even more vicious murder rocks East Dingleford, Kendra realizes that they’re dealing with a stone-cold killer—one who has a shocking secret that he will do anything to protect.</description>

  <description>Former FBI agent Kendra Donovan’s attempts to return to the twenty-first century have failed, leaving her stuck at Aldridge Castle in 1815. And her problems have just begun: in London, the Duke of Aldridge’s nephew Alec—Kendra’s confidante and lover—has come under suspicion for murdering his former mistress, Lady Dover, who was found viciously stabbed with a stiletto, her face carved up in a bizarre and brutal way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Dover had plenty of secrets, and her past wasn’t quite what she’d made it out to be. Nor is it entirely in the past—which becomes frighteningly clear when a crime lord emerges from London’s seamy underbelly to threaten Alec. Joining forces with Bow Street Runner Sam Kelly, Kendra must navigate the treacherous nineteenth century while she picks through the strands of Lady Dover’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the noose tightens around Alec’s neck, Kendra will do anything to save him, including following every twist and turn through London’s glittering ballrooms, where deception is the norm—and any attempt to uncover the truth will get someone killed.</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen—especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friend Zone&lt;/i&gt; will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1936, tucked deep into the woods of Troublesome Creek, KY, lives blue-skinned 19-year-old Cussy Carter, the last living female of the rare Blue People ancestry. The lonely young Appalachian woman joins the historical Pack Horse Library Project of Kentucky and becomes a librarian, riding across slippery creek beds and up treacherous mountains on her faithful mule to deliver books and other reading material to the impoverished hill people of Eastern Kentucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along her dangerous route, Cussy, known to the mountain folk as Bluet, confronts those suspicious of her damselfly-blue skin and the government's new book program. She befriends hardscrabble and complex fellow Kentuckians, and is fiercely determined to bring comfort and joy, instill literacy, and give to those who have nothing, a bookly respite, a fleeting retreat to faraway lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek&lt;i&gt; is a powerful message about how the written word affects people--a story of hope and heartbreak, raw courage and strength splintered with poverty and oppression, and one woman's chances beyond the darkly hollows. Inspired by the true and historical blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service, &lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek showcases a bold and unique tale of the Pack horse Librarians in literary novels — a story of fierce strength and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere — even back home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tosca Lee brings a modern twist to an ancient mystery surrounding the most notorious female serial killer of all time. A fast-paced thriller for fans of Ted Dekker’s &lt;i&gt;The Books of Mortals&lt;/i&gt;, Dan Brown’s &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;, and BBC America’s hit series &lt;i&gt;Orphan Black&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Jacobs is the descendant of a serial killer. Now, she’s become the hunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She’s on a quest that will take her to the secret underground of Europe and the inner circles of three ancient orders—one determined to kill her, one devoted to keeping her alive, and one she must ultimately save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Filled with adrenaline, romance, and reversals, &lt;i&gt;The Progeny &lt;/i&gt;is the present-day saga of a 400-year-old war between the uncanny descendants of “Blood Countess” Elizabeth Bathory, the most prolific female serial killer of all time, and a secret society dedicated to erasing every one of her descendants. A story about the search for self filled with centuries-old intrigues against the backdrop of atrocity and hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Best-selling author and mortician Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from kids about death, dead bodies, and decomposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, funeral director Caitlin Doughty receives dozens of questions about death. What would happen to an astronaut’s body if it were pushed out of a space shuttle? Do people poop when they die? Can Grandma have a Viking funeral?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?&lt;/em&gt;, Doughty blends her mortician’s knowledge of the body and the intriguing history behind common misconceptions about corpses to offer factual, hilarious, and candid answers to thirty-five distinctive questions posed by her youngest fans. In her inimitable voice, Doughty details lore and science of what happens to, and inside, our bodies after we die. Why do corpses groan? What causes bodies to turn colors during decomposition? And why do hair and nails appear longer after death? Readers will learn the best soil for mummifying your body, whether you can preserve your best friend’s skull as a keepsake, and what happens when you die on a plane. Beautifully illustrated by Dianné Ruz, &lt;em&gt;Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?&lt;/em&gt; shows us that death is science and art, and only by asking questions can we begin to embrace it.</description>

  <description>The murder of an Ivy League professor pulls Dr. Dylan Reinhart out of his ivory tower and onto the streets of New York, where he reunited with his old partner, Detective Elizabeth Needham. As the worst act of terror since 9/11 strikes the city, a name on the casualty list rocks Dylan's world. Is his secret past about to be brought to light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the terrorist attack unfolds, Elizabeth Needham does something courageous that thrusts her into the media spotlight. She's a reluctant hero. And thanks to the attention, she also becomes a prime target for the ruthless murderer behind the attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan literally wrote the book on the psychology of murder, and he and Elizabeth have solved cases that have baffled conventional detectives. But the sociopath they're facing this time is the opposite of a textbook case. There's no time to study for the test he's about to give them. And if they fail, they die. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond, from the author of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader, and soon Alice's greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who's never asked a man's permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to them--and to the men they love--becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, &lt;i&gt;The Giver of Stars&lt;/i&gt; is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic--a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.</description>

  <description>In this dark, suspenseful thriller, Alex North weaves a multi-generational tale of a father and son caught in the crosshairs of an investigation to catch a serial killer preying on a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his wife, Tom Kennedy believes a fresh start will help him and his young son Jake heal. A new beginning, a new house, a new town. Featherbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed "The Whisper Man," for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window...</description>

  <description>“This is a random universe,” Reacher says. “Once in a blue moon things turn out just right.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t one of those times.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reacher is on a Greyhound bus, minding his own business, with no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. Then he steps off the bus to help an old man who is obviously just a victim waiting to happen. But you know what they say about good deeds. Now Reacher wants to make it right.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An elderly couple have made a few well-meaning mistakes, and now they owe big money to some very bad people. One brazen move leads to another, and suddenly Reacher finds himself a wanted man in the middle of a brutal turf war between rival Ukrainian and Albanian gangs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reacher has to stay one step ahead of the loan sharks, the thugs, and the assassins. He teams up with a fed-up waitress who knows a little more than she’s letting on, and sets out to take down the powerful and make the greedy pay. It’s a long shot. The odds are against him. But Reacher believes in a certain kind of justice . . . the kind that comes along once in a blue moon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harry Bosch and LAPD Detective Renee Ballard come together again on the murder case that obsessed Bosch's mentor, the man who trained him -- new from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Michael Connelly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Back when Harry Bosch was just a rookie homicide detective, he had an inspiring mentor who taught him to take the work personally and light the fire of relentlessness for every case. Now that mentor, John Jack Thompson, is dead, but after his funeral his widow hands Bosch a murder book that Thompson took with him when he left the LAPD 20 years before -- the unsolved killing of a troubled young man in an alley used for drug deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bosch brings the murder book to Renée Ballard and asks her to help him find what about the case lit Thompson's fire all those years ago. That will be their starting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bond between Bosch and Ballard tightens as they become a formidable investigation team. And they soon arrive at a worrying question: Did Thompson steal the murder book to work the case in retirement, or to make sure it never got solved?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Four Women. Four Confessions. One Murder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something has gone terribly wrong at the Banks wedding. A man is dead. Four different women rush to offer confessions, each insisting that they committed the crime -- alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger is holding her family together by a thread, and this wedding weekend is not the fabulous getaway she anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate has enough money to buy her way out of anything. Well, almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily can't shake her reputation or her memories, and she's planning to drown this whole vacation in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lulu's got ex-husbands to spare, and another on the way -- as soon as she figures out what the devil the current husband is up to behind her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would they confess to the same murder? Only they know -- and they're not telling. This page-turning novel explores the depths of friendship and the truths we love to ignore.</description>

  <description>The wry, macabre, unforgettable tale of an ambitious orphan in Revolutionary Paris, befriended by royalty and radicals, who transforms herself into the legendary Madame Tussaud.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1761, a tiny, odd-looking girl named Marie is born in a village in Switzerland. After the death of her parents, she is apprenticed to an eccentric wax sculptor and whisked off to the seamy streets of Paris, where they meet a domineering widow and her quiet, pale son. Together, they convert an abandoned monkey house into an exhibition hall for wax heads, and the spectacle becomes a sensation. As word of her artistic talent spreads, Marie is called to Versailles, where she tutors a princess and saves Marie Antoinette in childbirth. But outside the palace walls, Paris is roiling: The revolutionary mob is demanding heads, and . . . at the wax museum, heads are what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of Gregory Maguire's Wicked and Erin Morgenstern's &lt;i&gt;The Night Circus&lt;/i&gt;, Edward Carey's &lt;i&gt;Little&lt;/i&gt; is a darkly endearing cavalcade of a novel--a story of art, class, determination, and how we hold on to what we love.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Chasing a cybercriminal into the pitch-black heart of the Dark Web.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special Agent Lisa Tanchik is the best at taking down cybercriminals. So when the FBI discovers a multibillion-dollar black market online, she’s tasked with finding the creator and bringing him to justice. Donning one of her many digital disguises, Tanchik goes undercover into the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliant college student Nate Fallon started his site as an idealistic experiment. But his platform has made illegal trade not only more efficient—but also more dangerous. Now the FBI aren’t the only ones out to get him. As profits soar, a criminal organization casts its monstrous gaze on Fallon, and danger leaps from cyberspace into reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling pressure from both sides of the law, Fallon is forced to make a decision with shattering consequences. Can Agent Tanchik find Fallon before his dangerous infrastructure falls into the wrong hands?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A vicious assault. A devastating accusation. Who should she trust, her husband or her best friend?&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be the perfect reunion: six university friends together again after twenty years. Host Ali finally has the life she always wanted, a career she can be proud of and a wonderful family with her college boyfriend, now husband. But that night her best friend makes an accusation so shocking that nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Karen staggers in from the garden, bleeding and traumatised, she claims that she has been assaulted—by Ali’s husband, Mike. Ali must make a split-second decision: who should she believe? Her horrified husband, or her best friend? With Mike offering a very different version of events, Ali knows one of them is lying—but which? And why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ensuing chaos forces her to re-examine the golden era the group shared at university, Ali realises there are darker memories too. Memories that have lain dormant for decades. Memories someone would kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Pledge of Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a story of resistance, intrigue, and risking it all in the WWII Philippines.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 1941. War has erupted in the Pacific, spelling danger for Gina Capelli Thorpe, an American expat living in Manila. When the Japanese invade and her husband goes missing, Gina flees with her daughter to the Zambales Mountains to avoid capture—or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for money, medicine, and guns, the resistance recruits Gina to join their underground army and smuggles her back to Manila. There, she forges a new identity and opens a nightclub, where seductive beauties sing, dance, and tease secrets out of high-ranking Japanese officers while the wildly successful club and its enemy patrons help fund the resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But operating undercover in the spotlight has Gina struggling to stay a step ahead of the Japanese. She’s risked everything to take a stand, but her club is a house of cards in the eye of a storm. Can Gina keep this delicate operation running long enough to outlast the enemy, or is she on a sure path to defeat that will put her family, her freedom, or even her life at risk?</description>

  <description>A young witch emerges from a curse to find her world upended in this gripping fantasy of betrayal, vengeance, and self-discovery set in turn-of-the-century France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries, the vineyards at Château Renard have depended on the talent of their vine witches, whose spells help create the world-renowned wine of the Chanceaux Valley. Then the skill of divining harvests fell into ruin when sorcière Elena Boureanu was blindsided by a curse. Now, after breaking the spell that confined her to the shallows of a marshland and weakened her magic, Elena is struggling to return to her former life. And the vineyard she was destined to inherit is now in the possession of a handsome stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vigneron Jean-Paul Martel naively favors science over superstition, and he certainly doesn’t endorse the locals’ belief in witches. But Elena knows a hex when she sees one, and the vineyard is covered in them. To stay on and help the vines recover, she’ll have to hide her true identity, along with her plans for revenge against whoever stole seven winters of her life. And she won’t rest until she can defy the evil powers that are still a threat to herself, Jean-Paul, and the ancient vine-witch legacy in the rolling hills of the Chanceaux Valley.</description>

  <description>A SWEEPING AND SUSPENSEFUL TALE OF ROMANCE, FATE, AND FORTUNE &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semele Cohen appraises antiquities for an exclusive Manhattan auction house, specializing in deciphering ancient texts. And when she discovers a manuscript written in the time of Cleopatra, she knows it will be the find of her career. Its author tells the story of a priceless tarot deck, now lost to history, but as Semele delves further she realizes the manuscript is more than it seems. Both a memoir and a prophecy, it appears to be the work of a powerful seer, describing devastating wars and natural disasters in detail thousands of years before they occurred. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more she reads, the more the manuscript begins to affect Semele's life. But what happened to the cards? As the mystery of her connection to the manuscript deepens, Semele can’t shake the feeling that she’s being followed. Only one person can help her make sense of it all: her client, Theo Brossard. Yet Theo is arrogant and elusive, concealing secrets of his own, and there’s more to Semele’s desire to speak with him than she would like to admit. Can Semele even trust him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auction date is swiftly approaching, and someone wants to interfere—someone who knows the cards exist, and that the Brossard manuscript is tied to her. Semele realizes it’s up to her to stop them: the manuscript holds the key to a two-thousand-year-old secret, a secret someone will do anything to possess.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - In her new novel, Danielle Steel tells a riveting story of the dark side of motherhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe Morgan's childhood was marked by her younger sister's tragic illness, watching as her parents dedicated themselves completely to her final days and then divorced. As a young woman driven by these painful memories, Zoe sets the bar high for herself, studying hard and pursuing a career in the nonprofit world, where her deep compassion for disadvantaged children finds a focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zoe falls in love and has her own child, she is determined to be a perfect mother as well. But before long, old scars long dormant begin to pull Zoe to the edge of an abyss too terrifying to contemplate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Zoe is haunted by the ghosts of the past, her story will become a race against time and a tale of psychological suspense that no reader will soon forget.</description>

  <description>The revered &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author returns with a novel set in 1960s Baltimore that combines modern psychological insights with elements of classic noir, about a middle-aged housewife turned aspiring reporter who pursues the murder of a forgotten young woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline "Maddie" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Star.&lt;/em&gt; Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleo Sherwood was a young African-American woman who liked to have a good time. No one seems to know or care why she was killed except Maddie--and the dead woman herself. Maddie's going to find the truth about Cleo's life and death. Cleo's ghost, privy to Maddie's poking and prying, wants to be left alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie's investigation brings her into contact with people that used to be on the periphery of her life--a jewelery store clerk, a waitress, a rising star on the Baltimore Orioles, a patrol cop, a hardened female reporter, a lonely man in a movie theater. But for all her ambition and drive, Maddie often fails to see the people right in front of her. Her inability to look beyond her own needs will lead to tragedy and turmoil for all sorts of people--including the man who shares her bed, a black police officer who cares for Maddie more than she knows.</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>That Month in Tuscany . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren Sawyer and Lizzy Harper live completely different lives. He’s a rock star with a secret he can no longer live with. She’s a regular person whose husband stood her up for a long planned anniversary trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a flight across the Atlantic headed for Italy, a drunken pity party and untimely turbulence literally drop Lizzy into Ren’s lap. It is the last thing she can imagine ever happening to someone like her. But despite their surface differences, they discover an undeniable pull between them. A pull that leads them both to remember who they had once been before letting themselves be changed by a life they had each chosen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring the streets of Florence and the hills of Tuscany together - two people with seemingly nothing in common - changes them both forever. And what they find in each other is something that might just heal them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Previously titled Rock Her.</description>

But everything isn't as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first colony of settlers--from the Carthage--have disappeared. Their settlement is still there, but everyone is gone. As James digs into the mystery of the lost colony, he discovers a series of spheres, buried on Eos. Are they the key to finding the lost colonists? Or are they responsible for their deaths?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as James is unraveling the secrets of the spheres, a storm hits Jericho City. Emma, recently elected mayor, struggles to lead her people to safety while James tries to make his way home. In the middle of the chaos, a new danger emerges--a threat no one saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out to save the colonists, James and Emma face their hardest choice yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE LOST COLONY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lost Colony&lt;/i&gt; is the third and final book in The Long Winter trilogy, which began with &lt;i&gt;Winter World&lt;/i&gt; and continued in &lt;i&gt;The Solar War&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A former detective is starting over in a small town, but his past won't let him go in this gripping new stand-alone from the world's bestselling thriller writer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Inn at Gloucester stands alone on the rocky New England shoreline. Its seclusion suits former Boston police detective Bill Robinson, novice owner and innkeeper.

A new crew of deadly criminals move into the small town, bringing drugs and violence to the front door of the inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robinson feels the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. His sense of duty compels him to fight off the threat to his town. But he can’t do it alone. Before time runs out, the residents of the inn will face a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stand together? Or die alone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the bestselling and award-winning master of suspense, the first novel in a thrilling new series!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colter Shaw is an itinerate "reward-seeker," traveling the country to help police solve crimes and private citizens locate missing persons. When he learns of a reward for a missing college student in Silicon Valley, he takes the job. The investigation quickly thrusts him into the dark heart of Silicon Valley and the cutthroat billion-dollar video gaming industry--and then a second kidnapping happens...and this victim turns up dead. The clues soon point to one video game, The Never Game, in which the player has to survive after being left abandoned. Is a madman bringing that game to life? If so, Shaw has to stop him before he strikes again...and before he figures out that Shaw is on his trail.</description>

  <description>Rose Collier refused to let them see her crumble as she sprinted across the lobby, the big white dress billowing out of the convertible as she fled. In a daze, she left the city behind, only stopping for necessities, until she found herself staring at the ocean, inhaling deep lungfuls of clean salty sea air. The vintage car sputtered and died as she coasted into Magnolia Beach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Parrish had it all. Money, women, model looks, and fast cars. Until the accident. Then his uncle stole his trust fund. Now he's broke, ugly, and ill-tempered, not to mention he doesn’t have a single employable skill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Certain she’s in no danger of falling for another entitled rich guy, Rose takes a position cleaning for the town hermit. She needs time to heal, to figure out what comes next. Alex doesn’t know who he is without his money and his looks, but going by the new housekeeper’s reaction, he’ll never set foot in public again. He’s fired every other housekeeper in three towns so he’s stuck with the beguiling Rose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly. As Alex spends more and more time with Rose, he falls head over heels in love for the first time in his miserable life. Too bad she’s made it clear there could never be anything between them other than friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He came home a hero and lost the only woman he’s ever loved... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how to survive without my beloved Ava. She had no choice but to move on with her life during my six-year deployment and has now married Eric. I hate him for taking her from me. I’d prefer to wallow in my depression and heartbreak, but the whole damned world wants a piece of the SEAL Team leader who helped capture the world’s most-wanted terrorist. I need help handling the relentless requests, and when Ava sends her new sister-in-law to manage the media circus for me, I’m prepared to hate her on principle. Her brother took my Ava. What else do I need to know about her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julianne&lt;br /&gt;It takes five seconds to realize Ava’s ex is going to be the most complicated and difficult client I’ve ever had, but the opportunity to represent the most celebrated man in the world could make my career. I’m determined to do the job, even if I dislike John from the moment I meet him. And I like everyone. So much so that my brothers worry about me being exploited by those who would take advantage of my unwavering love for others. But John… He’s in a class by himself, and his bitterness is a festering wound that I begin to wish I could somehow fix for him. The more time we spend together, the more our mutual disdain morphs into something that feels an awful lot like desire. There’s no way I can want this man, or so I tell myself, and when Eric finds out I’ve developed feelings for the man causing trouble in his new marriage, well…&lt;br /&gt;That’s going to be a hot mess. &lt;br /&gt;The hotly anticipated follow up to Five Years Gone is here!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unforgettable love story, a novel about past mistakes and betrayals that ripple throughout generations, &lt;i&gt;The Guest Book &lt;/i&gt;examines not just a privileged American family, but a privileged America. It is a literary triumph.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guest Book&lt;/i&gt; follows three generations of a powerful American family, a family that “used to run the world”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the novel begins in 1935, they still do. Kitty and Ogden Milton appear to have everything—perfect children, good looks, a love everyone envies. But after a tragedy befalls them, Ogden tries to bring Kitty back to life by purchasing an island in Maine. That island, and its house, come to define and burnish the Milton family, year after year after year. And it is there that Kitty issues a refusal that will haunt her till the day she dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1959 a young Jewish man, Len Levy, will get a job in Ogden’s bank and earn the admiration of Ogden and one of his daughters, but the scorn of everyone else. Len’s best friend Reg Pauling has always been the only black man in the room—at Harvard, at work, and finally at the Miltons’ island in Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An island that, at the dawn of the 21st century, this last generation doesn’t have the money to keep. When Kitty’s granddaughter hears that she and her cousins might be forced to sell it, and when her husband brings back disturbing evidence about her grandfather’s past, she realizes she is on the verge of finally understanding the silences that seemed to hover just below the surface of her family all her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ambitious novel that weaves the American past with its present, &lt;i&gt;The Guest Book&lt;/i&gt; looks at the racism and power that has been systemically embedded in the US for generations. Brimming with gorgeous writing and bitterly accurate social criticism, it is a literary tour de force.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Pull up a lounge chair and have a cocktail at Sunset Beach – it comes with a twist.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drue Campbell’s life is adrift. Out of a job and down on her luck, life doesn’t seem to be getting any better when her estranged father, Brice Campbell, a flamboyant personal injury attorney, shows up at her mother’s funeral after a twenty-year absence. Worse, he’s remarried – to Drue’s eighth grade frenemy, Wendy, now his office manager. And they’re offering her a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the job from hell, but the offer is sweetened by the news of her inheritance – her grandparents’ beach bungalow in the sleepy town of Sunset Beach, a charming but storm-damaged eyesore now surrounded by waterfront McMansions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other prospects, Drue begrudgingly joins the firm, spending her days screening out the grifters whose phone calls flood the law office. Working with Wendy is no picnic either. But when a suspicious death at an exclusive beach resort nearby exposes possible corruption at her father’s firm, she goes from unwilling cubicle rat to unwitting investigator, and is drawn into a case that may – or may not – involve her father. With an office romance building, a decades-old missing persons case re-opened, and a cottage in rehab, one thing is for sure at Sunset Beach: there’s a storm on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunset Beach &lt;/i&gt;is a compelling ride, full of Mary Kay Andrews' signature wit, heart, and charm.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;What might have been&lt;/i&gt;? That tantalizing question propels a woman on a cross-country adventure to reunite with the men she loved and let go, in Danielle Steel’s exhilarating new novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It all starts with a fall from a ladder, in a firehouse in New York City. The firehouse has been converted into a unique Manhattan home and studio where renowned photographer Madison Allen works and lives after raising three children on her own. But the accident, which happens while Maddie is sorting through long-forgotten personal mementos and photos, results in more than a broken ankle. It changes her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Spurred by old memories, the forced pause in her demanding schedule, and an argument with her daughter that leads to a rare crisis of confidence, Maddie embarks on a road trip. She hopes to answer questions about the men she loved and might have married—but didn’t—in the years after she was left alone with three young children. Wearing a cast and driving a rented SUV, she sets off to reconnect with three very different men—one in Boston, one in Chicago, and another in Wyoming—to know once and for all if the decisions she made long ago were the right ones. Before moving forward into the future, she is compelled to confront the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the miles and days pass, and with each new encounter, Maddie’s life comes into clearer focus and a new future takes shape. A deeply felt story about love, motherhood, family, and fate, &lt;i&gt;Lost and Found&lt;/i&gt; is an irresistible new novel from America’s most dynamic storyteller.</description>

  <description>From Jennifer Weiner, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Who Do You Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Her Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, comes a smart, thoughtful, and timely exploration of two sisters’ lives from the 1950s to the present as they struggle to find their places—and be true to themselves—in a rapidly evolving world. &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Everything&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we change or does the world change us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her most ambitious novel yet, Jennifer Weiner tells a story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For both Zane and Darby, their small town roots hold a terrible secret. Now, decades later, they've come together to build a new life. But will the past set them free or pull them under?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane Bigelow grew up in a beautiful, perfectly kept house in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Strangers―and even Zane’s own aunt across the lake―see his parents as a successful surgeon and his stylish wife, making appearances at their children’s ballet recitals and baseball games. Only Zane and his sister know the truth, until one brutal night finally reveals cracks in the facade, and Zane escapes for college without a thought of looking back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Zane returns to his hometown determined to reconnect with the place and people that mean so much to him, despite the painful memories. As he resumes life in the colorful town, he meets a gifted landscape artist named Darby, who is on the run from ghosts of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they will have to teach each other what it means to face the past, and stand up for the ones they love.</description>

  <description>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In Danielle Steel’s remarkable new novel, one of her most memorable characters comes to terms with unfinished business and long-buried truths as the mother of three very different daughters with three singular fathers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a young intern at an art gallery in Paris, Isabelle McAvoy meets Putnam Armstrong, wealthy, gentle, older, and secluded from the world. Isabelle’s relationship with Putnam, and her time at his château on the Normandy coast, are the stuff of dreams. But it turns real when she becomes pregnant, for she knows that marriage is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Isabelle returns to New York, she enters a new relationship that she hopes will be more stable and traditional. But she soon realizes she has made a terrible mistake and again finds herself a single mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two young daughters and no husband, Isabelle finally and unexpectedly finds happiness and a love that gives her a third child, a baby as happy as her beloved father. And yet, once again, life brings dramatic changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three girls grow up to be very different women, and Isabelle’s relationship with each of them is unique. While raising her girls alone, Isabelle also begins building a career as a successful art consultant. Then one final turn of fate brings a past secret to light, bonds mother and daughters closer, and turns a challenge into a blessing.</description>

  <description>The only child of a single mother, Nina has her life just as she wants it: a job in a bookstore, a kick-butt trivia team, a world-class planner and a cat named Phil. If she sometimes suspects there might be more to life than reading, she just shrugs and picks up a new book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the father Nina never knew existed suddenly dies, leaving behind innumerable sisters, brothers, nieces, and nephews, Nina is horrified. They all live close by! They're all—or mostly all—excited to meet her! She'll have to Speak. To. Strangers. It's a disaster! And as if that wasn't enough, Tom, her trivia nemesis, has turned out to be cute, funny, and deeply interested in getting to know her. Doesn't he realize what a terrible idea that is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina considers her options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Completely change her name and appearance. (Too drastic, plus she &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt; her hair.) &lt;br /&gt;2. Flee to a deserted island. (Hard pass, see: coffee). &lt;br /&gt;3. Hide in a corner of her apartment and rock back and forth. (Already doing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time for Nina to come out of her comfortable shell, but she isn't convinced real life could ever live up to fiction. It's going to take a brand-new family, a persistent suitor, and the combined effects of ice cream and trivia to make her turn her own fresh page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A code hidden in the human genome...&lt;br /&gt;Will reveal the ultimate secret of human existence.&lt;br /&gt;And could hold humanity's only hope of survival.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2003, the first human genome was sequenced. But the secrets it held were never revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth was discovered thirty years ago, almost by accident. Dr. Paul Kraus had spent his entire career searching for what he called humanity’s lost tribes—human ancestors who had gone extinct. When Kraus compared the DNA samples of the lost tribes with our own, he found a pattern of changes: a code. At the time, the technology didn't exist to unravel what it meant. To protect the secret, Keller hid his work and disappeared. Now the technology exists to finally understand the mysterious code buried in the human genome, but finding the pieces of Keller’s research is more dangerous than anyone imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Peyton Shaw and her mother have obtained part of Kraus’s research—and a cryptic message that could lead to the remaining pieces. They believe his work is the key to stopping a global conspiracy—and an event that will change humanity forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate secret, buried in the human genome, will change our very understanding of what it means to be human. For Peyton, finding it may come at an incredible price. She must weigh the lives of strangers against those she loves: Desmond Hughes and her mother. With time running out, Peyton makes a fateful choice—one that can never be undone.</description>

  <description>A deadly outbreak in Kenya. &lt;br /&gt;A conspiracy beyond imagination. &lt;br /&gt;And a race to save humanity in its darkest hour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From A.G. Riddle, the worldwide bestselling author of The Atlantis Gene and Departure, comes a novel that will change everything you think you know about pandemics. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A hundred miles north of Alaska, an American Coast Guard vessel discovers a sunken submarine at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. It has no national identification and doesn't match the records of any known vessel. Deep within, researchers find evidence of a scientific experiment that will alter our very understanding of the human race. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Atlanta, Dr. Peyton Shaw is awakened by the phone call she has dreaded for years. As the CDC's leading epidemiologist, she's among the first responders to outbreaks around the world. It's a lonely and dangerous job, but it's her life—and she's good at it. This time, she may have met her match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Kenya, an Ebola-like pathogen has infected two Americans. One lies at death's door. With the clock ticking, Peyton assembles her team and joins personnel from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the WHO. What they find in the remote village is beyond their worst fears. As she traces the origin of the pathogen, Peyton begins to believe that there is more to this outbreak—that it may be merely the opening act in a conspiracy with far reaching consequences. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Berlin, Desmond Hughes awakens in a hotel room with no memory of how he got there or who he is. On the floor, he finds a dead security guard from an international pharmaceutical company. His only clue leads him to Peyton Shaw—a woman who seems to know him, but refuses to tell him how. With the police searching the city for him, Desmond desperately tries to piece together what happened to him. To his shock and horror, he learns that he may be involved in causing the outbreak—and could hold the only key to stopping it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the pathogen spreads around the world, Peyton and Desmond race to unravel the conspiracy behind the pandemic—and uncover secrets some want to keep buried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT PANDEMIC &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PANDEMIC is A.G. Riddle's first new novel in almost two and a half years. The product of extensive research, PANDEMIC takes readers inside the CDC and WHO response to a deadly outbreak. It features the real-life science and history blended with fiction that readers have come to know and love in Riddle's past novels. PANDEMIC is the first novel in a new series: The Extinction Files.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;To an undaunted wallflower, he's just the beast next door.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy and ruthless, Gabriel Duke clawed his way from the lowliest slums to the pinnacle of high society—and now he wants to get even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyal and passionate, Lady Penelope Campion never met a lost or wounded creature she wouldn’t take into her home and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her imposing—and attractive—new neighbor demands she clear out the rescued animals, Penny sets him a challenge. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; will part with her precious charges, if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; can find them loving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done, Gabriel says. How hard can it be to find homes for a few kittens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a two-legged dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a foul-mouthed parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a goat, an otter, a hedgehog . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done, for a cold-blooded bastard who wouldn’t know a loving home from a workhouse. Soon he’s covered in cat hair, knee-deep in adorable, and bewitched by a shyly pretty spinster who defies his every attempt to resist. Now she’s set her mind and heart on saving &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if he ruins her first.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Orphan X returns—facing his own uncertain future and undertaking one last mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken from a group home at age twelve, Evan Smoak was trained as an off-the-books government assassin: Orphan X. After breaking with the Program, he reinvented himself as The Nowhere Man, a figure shrouded in shadows who helps the truly desperate. But the government didn’t let go of him easily, sending their best to hunt him down and eliminate him. All of them failed. With his deadliest enemies behind him, Evan is facing a new challenge—what is he going to do now that no one is after him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Merriweather is at the end of his rope. Separated from the woman he loves and barely scraping by, Max is a disappointment to everyone in his life. Then his very successful cousin Grant is brutally murdered. Two months before, Grant left Max an envelope with instructions to take it to a reporter if anything happened to him. Now the reporter is missing and Max’s apartment is ransacked. A man at the end of his rope, he calls The Nowhere Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With mixed feelings, Evan takes on this mission, easily finding the men who are after Max and executing a plan to keep him safe. But it isn’t as obvious as it seems—and Evan finds himself enmeshed in one of the most challenging missions of his life, one that he can’t survive on his own. With the help of Joey Morales, a genius-level hacker and the last Orphan recruited into the Program, and the brilliant, off-the-books gunsmith, Tommy Stojack, Orphan X once more heads…Into the Fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;We thought the war was over.&lt;br /&gt;We were wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They decimated Earth during the Long Winter.&lt;br /&gt;Now the grid has returned, and they won't stop until the human race is extinct.&lt;br /&gt;On a ruined world, humanity's last survivors fight against impossible odds.&lt;br /&gt;In their darkest hour, they discover a new hope for survival. But it comes at an unthinkable price, with consequences that will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Long Winter, Emma Matthews and James Sinclair hoped life would get back to normal. They've settled down in Camp Seven and welcomed their first child, a daughter. And they have waited and watched the sky for any signs of the grid's return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When NASA discovers that several asteroids have broken from the Kuiper Belt and are headed for Earth, James instantly realizes the truth: the grid is back. And this battle will be one to the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he and his team prepare for humanity's last stand in space and on the ground, Emma makes a discovery closer to home, one that will change life for her and James once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war raging around them, Emma and James fight to keep their family alive. In the cold darkness, humanity splinters. New alliances emerge. At every turn, Emma and James face new dangers--and question whom to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that all hope is lost, James uncovers what may be the key to humanity's survival. But it comes with enormous risks. To implement his plan, he and Emma will have to survive the grid and another, even more deadly enemy. One thing is certain: their gambit will change the future of the human race forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Making readers care and feel like they’re part of the story should be the number one goal of all writers. Ironically, many storytellers fail to maximize one of fiction’s most powerful elements to achieve this: the setting. Rather than being a simple backdrop against which events unfold, every location has the potential to become a conduit for conveying emotion, characterizing the cast, providing opportunities for deep point of view, and revealing significant backstory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside The Urban Thesaurus, you’ll find: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•A list of the sights, smells, tastes, textures, and sounds for over 120 urban settings&lt;br /&gt;•Possible sources of conflict for each location to help you brainstorm ways to naturally complicate matters for your characters&lt;br /&gt;•Advice on how to make every piece of description count so you can maintain the right pace and keep readers engaged&lt;br /&gt;•Tips on utilizing the five senses to encourage readers to more fully experience each moment by triggering their own emotional memories&lt;br /&gt;•Information on how to use the setting to characterize a story’s cast through personalization and emotional values while using emotional triggers to steer their decisions &lt;br /&gt;•A review of specific challenges that arise when writing urban locations, along with common descriptive pitfalls that should be avoided&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Urban Setting Thesaurus helps you tailor each setting to your characters while creating a realistic, textured world readers will long to return to, even after the book closes. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman’s impossible journey through the ages could change everything…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Gallagher grew up enchanted by her grandfather’s stories of Ireland. Heartbroken at his death, she travels to his childhood home to spread his ashes. There, overcome with memories of the man she adored and consumed by a history she never knew, she is pulled into another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ireland of 1921, teetering on the edge of war, is a dangerous place in which to awaken. But there Anne finds herself, hurt, disoriented, and under the care of Dr. Thomas Smith, guardian to a young boy who is oddly familiar. Mistaken for the boy’s long-missing mother, Anne adopts her identity, convinced the woman’s disappearance is connected to her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions rise, Thomas joins the struggle for Ireland’s independence and Anne is drawn into the conflict beside him. Caught between history and her heart, she must decide whether she’s willing to let go of the life she knew for a love she never thought she’d find. But in the end, is the choice actually hers to make?</description>

  <description>On the Crystal Coast of North Carolina, in the small town of Emerald Isle… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Juli Cooke, hard-working and getting nowhere fast, marries a dying man, Ben Bradshaw, for a financial settlement, not expecting he will set her on a journey of hope and love. The journey brings her to Luke Winters, a local art dealer, but Luke resents the woman who married his sick friend and warns her not to hurt Ben—and he’s watching to make sure she doesn’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Ben dies and the stakes change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Framed by the timelessness of the Atlantic Ocean and the brilliant blue of the beach sky, Juli struggles against her past, the opposition of Ben’s and Luke’s families, and even the living reminder of her marriage—to build a future with hope and perhaps to find the love of her life—if she can survive the danger from her past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;They are sworn enemies…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theodore Prescott the Third, one of Manhattan’s Rogues of Millionaire Row, has really done it this time. The only way to survive his most recent, unspeakably outrageous scandal is marry someone respectable. Someone sensible. Someone like Daisy Swan. Of all the girls in Gilded Age Manhattan, it had to be her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Pretending to be lovers...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Swan has plans and they do not involve a loveless marriage with anyone. But when a devastating family secret threatens to destroy her standing in society, suddenly a fake engagement with Theo is just the thing to make all her dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And now it’s time to kiss and make up…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Swan aspires to sell cosmetics that she has created, but this brainy scientist needs a smooth talking charmer’s flair for words and eye for beauty to make it a success. Before long, Daisy and Theo are trading kisses. And secrets. And discovering that despite appearances, they might be the perfect couple after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling author C. J. Box returns with a suspenseful new Joe Pickett novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nate Romanowski is off the grid, recuperating from wounds and trying to deal with past crimes, when he is suddenly surrounded by a small team of elite professional special operators. They’re not there to threaten him, but to make a deal. They need help destroying a domestic terror cell in Wyoming’s Red Desert, and in return they’ll make Nate’s criminal record disappear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they are not what they seem, as Nate’s friend Joe Pickett discovers. They have a much different plan in mind, and it just may be something that takes them all down—including Nate and Joe.</description>

  <description>Overworked and underappreciated, single mom Amy Byler needs a break. So when the guilt-ridden husband who abandoned her shows up and offers to take care of their kids for the summer, she accepts his offer and escapes rural Pennsylvania for New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually grounded and mild mannered, Amy finally lets her hair down in the city that never sleeps. She discovers a life filled with culture, sophistication, and—with a little encouragement from her friends—a few blind dates. When one man in particular makes quick work of Amy’s heart, she risks losing herself completely in the unexpected escape, and as the summer comes to an end, Amy realizes too late that she must make an impossible decision: stay in this exciting new chapter of her life, or return to the life she left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before she can choose, a crisis forces the two worlds together, and Amy must stare down a future where she could lose both sides of herself, and every dream she’s ever nurtured, in the beat of a heart.</description>

  <description>Silence can be &lt;em&gt;deafening&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean McClellan spends her time in almost complete silence, limited to just one hundred words a day. Any more, and a thousand volts of electricity will course through her veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the new government is in power, everything has changed. But only if you’re a &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt;. Almost overnight, bank accounts are frozen, passports are taken away and seventy million women lose their jobs. Even more terrifyingly, young girls are no longer taught to read or write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and for every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice. This is only the beginning…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, don’t miss the thrilling debut that everyone is talking about!</description>

  <description>In a small town in Maine, recently widowed Eveleth "Evvie" Drake rarely leaves her house. Everyone in town, including her best friend, Andy, thinks grief keeps her locked inside, and she doesn't correct them. In New York, Dean Tenney, former major-league pitcher and Andy's childhood friend, is struggling with a case of the "yips": he can't throw straight anymore, and he can't figure out why. An invitation from Andy to stay in Maine for a few months seems like the perfect chance to hit the reset button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dean moves into an apartment at the back of Evvie's house, the two make a deal: Dean won't ask about Evvie's late husband, and Evvie won't ask about Dean's baseball career. Rules, though, have a funny way of being broken--and what starts as an unexpected friendship soon turns into something more. But before they can find out what might lie ahead, they'll have to wrestle a few demons: the bonds they've broken, the plans they've changed, and the secrets they've kept. They'll need a lot of help, but in life, as in baseball, there's always a chance--right up until the last out.</description>

  <description>Nina Redmond is a literary matchmaker. Pairing a reader with that perfect book is her passion… and also her job. Or at least it was. Until yesterday, she was a librarian in the hectic city. But now the job she loved is no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to make a new life for herself, Nina moves to a sleepy village many miles away. There she buys a van and transforms it into a bookmobile—a mobile bookshop that she drives from neighborhood to neighborhood, changing one life after another with the power of storytelling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From helping her grumpy landlord deliver a lamb, to sharing picnics with a charming train conductor who serenades her with poetry, Nina discovers there’s plenty of adventure, magic, and soul in a place that’s beginning to feel like home… a place where she just might be able to write her own happy ending.</description>

  <description>A grand baronial house on Loch Ness, a quirky small-town bookseller, and a single mom looking for a fresh start all come together in this witty and warm-hearted novel by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jenny Colgan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to escape from London, single mother Zoe wants to build a new life for herself and her son Hari. She can barely afford the crammed studio apartment on a busy street where honking horns and shouting football fans keep them awake all night. If she doesn’t find a way out soon, Zoe knows it’s just a matter of time before she has a complete meltdown. On a whim, she answers an ad for a nanny job in the Scottish Highlands, which is about as far away from the urban crush of London as possible. It sounds heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job description asks for someone capable of caring for three “gifted children”, two of which behave like feral wolverines. The children’s widowed father is a wreck, and the kids run wild in a huge tumbledown castle on the heather-strewn banks of Loch Ness. Still, the peaceful, picturesque location is everything London is not—and Zoe rises to the challenges of the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of Nina, the friendly local bookseller, Zoe begins to put down roots in the community. Are books, fresh air, and kindness enough to heal this broken family—and her own…?</description>

  <description>A mesmerizing, moving, and elegantly written debut novel, The Language of Flowers beautifully weaves past and present, creating a vivid portrait of an unforgettable woman whose gift for flowers helps her change the lives of others even as she struggles to overcome her own troubled past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, asters for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what's been missing in her life, and when she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lady’s Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lady Henrietta Sedley declares her twenty-ninth year her own, she has plans to inherit her father’s business, to make her own fortune, and to live her own life. But first, she intends to experience a taste of the pleasure she’ll forgo as a confirmed spinster. Everything is going perfectly…until she discovers the most beautiful man she’s ever seen tied up in her carriage and threatening to ruin the Year of Hattie before it’s even begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bastard’s Proposal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he wakes in a carriage at Hattie’s feet, Whit, a king of Covent Garden known to all the world as Beast, can’t help but wonder about the strange woman who frees him—especially when he discovers she’s headed for a night of pleasure . . . on his turf. He is more than happy to offer Hattie all she desires…for a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Unexpected Passion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Hattie and Whit find themselves rivals in business and pleasure. She won’t give up her plans; he won’t give up his power . . . and neither of them sees that if they’re not careful, they’ll have no choice but to give up everything . . . including their hearts.</description>

  <description>Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience "fear of missing out" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day "digital declutter" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An ancient and dangerous power is being handed down from mother to daughter through some of the most consequential historic events of the last two centuries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Grandmére Ursule gives her life to save her tribe, her magic seems to die with her. Even so, her family keeps the Old Faith, practicing the spells and rites that have been handed from mother to daughter for generations. Until one day, Ursule’s young granddaughter steps into the circle, and magic flows anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From early 19th century Brittany to London during the Second World War, five generations of witches fight the battles of their time, deciding how far they are willing to go to protect their family, their heritage, and ultimately, all of our futures.</description>

  <description>In this lyrical, exuberant follow-up to her 2007 novel, &lt;i&gt;The Bastard of Istanbul&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed Turkish author Elif Shafak unfolds two tantalizing parallel narratives—one contemporary and the other set in the thirteenth century, when Rumi encountered his spiritual mentor, the whirling dervish known as Shams of Tabriz—that together incarnate the poet's timeless message of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ella Rubenstein is forty years old and unhappily married when she takes a job as a reader for a literary agent. Her first assignment is to read and report on &lt;i&gt;Sweet Blasphemy&lt;/i&gt;, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mir­rors her own and that Zahara—like Shams—has come to set her free.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt; will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.</description>

  <description>In the most suspenseful installment of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; nestselling Body Farm series to date, forensic anthropologist Dr. Bill Brockton investigates a bizarre murder—and confronts a deadly enemy he thought he’d put behind bars for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forensic anthropologist Bill Brockton has spent twenty-five years solving brutal murders—but none so bizarre and merciless as his latest case: A ravaged set of skeletal remains is found chained to a tree on a remote mountainside. As Brockton and his assistant Miranda dig deeper, they uncover warning signs of a deadly eruption of hatred and violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the shocking case is only the beginning of Brockton’s trials. Mid-case, the unthinkable happens: The deadliest criminal Brockton has ever foiled—the sadistic serial killer Nick Satterfield—escapes from prison, bent on vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But simply killing Brockton isn’t enough. Satterfield wants to make him suffer first, by destroying everything he holds dear: Brockton’s son, daughter-in-law, grandsons; even Miranda, his longtime graduate assistant, now on the verge of completing her Ph.D. and launching a forensic career of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dangers from all directions force Brockton to question two things on which he’s based his entire career—the justice system, and the quality of mercy—and to wonder: can the two co-exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not, which will Brockton choose in his ultimate moment of truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Tara Westover grew up preparing for the End of Days, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood. She spent her summers bottling peaches and her winters rotating emergency supplies, hoping that when the World of Men failed, her family would continue on, unaffected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in doctors or hospitals. According to the state and federal government, she didn’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she grew older, her father became more radical, and her brother, more violent. At sixteen Tara decided to educate herself. Her struggle for knowledge would take her far from her Idaho mountains, over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d travelled too far. If there was still a way home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDUCATED is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes with the severing of the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has, from her singular experience, crafted a universal coming-of-age story, one that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers – the perspective to see one’s life through new eyes, and the will to change it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her story is a phenomenon. Her life is a disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, she’s LadyConstellation, the anonymous creator of the wildly popular webcomic &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves the online one, and she has no desire to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Wallace Warland, &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;’s biggest fanfiction writer, transfers to her school. Wallace thinks Eliza is just another fan, and as he draws her out of her shell, she begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The runaway bestseller &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt; introduced the real-life heroine Caroline Ferriday. This sweeping new novel, set a generation earlier and also inspired by true events, features Caroline's mother, Eliza, and follows three equally indomitable women from St. Petersburg to Paris under the shadow of World War I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1914 and the world has been on the brink of war so many times, many New Yorkers treat the subject with only passing interest. Eliza Ferriday is thrilled to be traveling to St. Petersburg with Sofya Streshnayva, a cousin of the Romanov's. The two met years ago one summer in Paris and became close confidantes. Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia's Imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their country estate. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortuneteller's daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their household. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya's letters suddenly stop coming she fears the worst for her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg to the avenues of Paris and the society of fallen Russian emigre's who live there, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways, taking readers on a breathtaking ride through a momentous time in history.</description>

  <description>From the creator of Hannibal Lecter and &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt; comes a story of evil, greed, and the consequences of dark obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five million dollars in cartel gold lies hidden beneath a mansion on the Miami Beach waterfront. Ruthless men have tracked it for years. Leading the pack is Hans-Peter Schneider. Driven by unspeakable appetites, he makes a living fleshing out the violent fantasies of other, richer men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cari Mora, caretaker of the house, has escaped from the violence in her native country. She stays in Miami on a wobbly Temporary Protected Status, subject to the iron whim of ICE. She works at many jobs to survive. Beautiful, marked by war, Cari catches the eye of Hans-Peter as he closes in on the treasure. But Cari Mora has surprising skills, and her will to survive has been tested before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monsters lurk in the crevices between male desire and female survival. No other writer in the last century has conjured those monsters with more terrifying brilliance than Thomas Harris. &lt;i&gt;Cari Mora&lt;/i&gt;, his sixth novel, is the long-awaited return of an American master.</description>

  <description>FBI agent Emmy Dockery is absolutely relentless. She's young and driven, and her unique skill at seeing connections others miss has brought her an impressive string of arrests. But a shocking new case-unfolding across the country-has left her utterly baffled. The victims all appear to have died by accident, and have seemingly nothing in common. But this many deaths can't be coincidence. And the killer is somehow one step ahead of every move Dockery makes. &lt;i&gt;How?&lt;/i&gt; To FBI Internal Affairs special agent, Harrison "Books" Bookman, everyone in the FBI is a suspect-particularly Emmy Dockery (the fact that she's his ex-wife doesn't make it easier). But someone else is watching Dockery. Studying, learning, waiting. Until it's the perfect time to strike.</description>

  <description>In the enchanted kingdom of Brooklyn, the fashionable people put on cute shoes, go to parties in warehouses, drink on rooftops at sunset, and tell themselves they’ve &lt;i&gt;arrived&lt;/i&gt;. A whole lot of Brooklyn is like that now—but not Vassa’s working-class neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Vassa’s neighborhood, where she lives with her stepmother and bickering stepsisters, one might stumble onto magic, but stumbling away again could become an issue. Babs Yagg, the owner of the local convenience store, has a policy of beheading shoplifters—and sometimes innocent shoppers as well. So when Vassa’s stepsister sends her out for light bulbs in the middle of night, she knows it could easily become a suicide mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Vassa has a bit of luck hidden in her pocket, a gift from her dead mother. Erg is a tough-talking wooden doll with sticky fingers, a bottomless stomach, and a ferocious cunning. With Erg’s help, Vassa just might be able to break the witch’s curse and free her Brooklyn neighborhood. But Babs won’t be playing fair…</description>

  <description>Set in the glamorous 1920s, &lt;i&gt;A Fine Imitation&lt;/i&gt; is an intoxicating debut that sweeps readers into a privileged Manhattan socialite’s restless life and the affair with a mysterious painter that upends her world, flashing back to her years at Vassar and the friendship that brought her to the brink of ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera Bellington has beauty, pedigree, and a penthouse at The Angelus—the most coveted address on Park Avenue. But behind the sparkling social whirl, Vera is living a life of quiet desperation. Her days are an unbroken loop of empty, champagne-soaked socializing, while her nights are silent and cold, spent waiting alone in her cavernous apartment for a husband who seldom comes home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Emil Hallan arrives at The Angelus to paint a mural above its glittering subterranean pool. The handsome French artist moves into the building, shrouds his work in secrecy, and piques Vera’s curiosity, especially when the painter keeps dodging questions about his past. Is he the man he claims to be? Even as she finds herself increasingly drawn to Hallan’s warmth and passion, Vera can’t supress her suspicions. After all, she has plenty of secrets, too—and some of them involve art forgers like her bold, artistically talented former friend, Bea, who years ago, at Vassar, brought Vera to the brink of catastrophe and social exile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dangerous mysteries of Emil’s past are revealed, Vera faces an impossible choice—whether to cling to her familiar world of privilege and propriety or to risk her future with the enigmatic man who has taken her heart. &lt;i&gt;A Fine Imitation&lt;/i&gt; explores what happens when we realize that the life we’ve always led is not the life we want to have.</description>

  <description>An international bestseller, Kate Lord Brown's debut novel &lt;i&gt;The Perfume Garden&lt;/i&gt; has sold especially well in Canada, where it was selected as Read of the Month for June 2015 and made it to the Globe &amp;amp; Mail bestseller list. &lt;i&gt;The House of Dreams&lt;/i&gt; combines Brown's lovely, lyrical writing and signature interwoven past/present narrative style with an even more commercial time period and a fascinating real-life story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2000, Gabriel Lambert is a celebrated painter who hides a dark secret. Sophie Cass, a journalist struggling to begin her career and with a family connection to Lambert, is determined to find the truth about his past and the little known story of the real &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, an international group of rescue workers, refugee intellectuals, and artists gather in the beautiful old Villa Air Bel just outside Marseilles. American journalist Varian Fry and his remarkable team at the American Relief Center are working to help them escape France, but "the greatest man-trap in history" is closing in on them. Despite their peril, true camaraderie and creativity flourishes - while love affairs spring up and secrets are hidden. At the House of Dreams, young refugee artist Gabriel Lambert changed the course of his life - and now, sixty years later at his home in the Hamptons, the truth is finally catching up with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Gillian Flynn and Daniel Woodrell, a dark, gripping debut novel of literary suspense about two mysterious disappearances, a generation apart, and the meaning of family-the sacrifices we make, the secrets we keep, and the lengths we will go to protect the ones we love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dane family's roots tangle deep in the Ozark Mountain town of Henbane, but that doesn't keep sixteen-year-old Lucy Dane from being treated like an outsider. Folks still whisper about her mother, a bewitching young stranger who inspired local myths when she vanished years ago. When one of Lucy's few friends, slow-minded Cheri, is found murdered, Lucy feels haunted by the two lost girls-the mother she never knew and the friend she couldn't protect. Everything changes when Lucy stumbles across Cheri's necklace in an abandoned trailer and finds herself drawn into a search for answers. What Lucy discovers makes it impossible to ignore the suspicion cast on her own kin. More alarming, she suspects Cheri's death could be linked to her mother's disappearance, and the connection between the two puts Lucy at risk of losing everything. In a place where the bonds of blood weigh heavy, Lucy must decide where her allegiances lie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A feverishly paced action adventure" (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) about a long-lost Shakespeare work and a killer who reenacts the Bard's most bloody murders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of the Globe's production of Hamlet, Shakespeare scholar and theater director Kate Stanley's eccentric mentor Rosalind Howard gives her a mysterious box, claiming to have made a groundbreaking discovery. Before she can reveal it to Kate, the Globe is burned to the ground and Roz is found dead--murdered in the strange manner of Hamlet's father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box, Kate finds the first piece in a Shakespearean puzzle, setting her on a deadly, high-stakes treasure hunt. From London to Harvard to the American West, Kate races to evade a killer and solve a tantalizing string of clues hidden in the words of Shakespeare, which may unlock one of history's greatest secrets. But Kate is not alone in this hunt, and the buried truth threatens to come at the ultimate cost.</description>

  <description>“&lt;i&gt;Blood of the Wicked&lt;/i&gt; manages to pack a huge amount into a spare three hundred pages; power politics, petty violence, sexual scandal, saintly courage, staggering poverty and obscene wealth. A book that makes you care about its large cast of characters, even when you know that they are going to die—frequently horribly. This is a novel as rich and complex as Brazil itself, with villains who make you want to spit, and heroes whose goodness is heartbreaking.”—Rebecca Pawel, Edgar Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Death of a Nationalist&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the remote Brazilian town of Cascatas do Pontal, where landless peasants are confronting the owners of vast estates, the bishop arrives by helicopter to consecrate a new church and is assassinated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mario Silva, chief inspector for criminal matters of the federal police of Brazil, is dispatched to the interior to find the killer. The pope himself has called Brazil’s president; the pressure is on Silva to perform. Assisted by his nephew, Hector Costa, also a federal policeman, Silva must battle the state police and a corrupt judiciary as well as criminals who prey on street kids, the warring factions of the Landless League, the big landowners, and the church itself, in order to solve the initial murder and several brutal killings that follow. Justice is hard to come by. An old priest, a secret liberation theologist, finally metes it out. Here is a Brazil that tourists never encounter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Leighton Gage&lt;/b&gt; is married to a Brazilian woman and spends part of each year in Santana do Parnaiba, Brazil, and the rest of the year in Florida and Belgium. This is his first novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heart-breaking, heart-warming historical novel of love and survival inspired by real resistance workers during World War II Austria, and the mysterious love letter that connects generations of Jewish families. For readers of &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sarah's Key&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Austria, 1938.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristoff is a young apprentice to a master Jewish stamp engraver. When his teacher disappears during Kristallnacht, Kristoff is forced to engrave stamps for the Germans, and simultaneously works alongside Elena, his beloved teacher's fiery daughter, and with the Austrian resistance to send underground messages and forge papers. As he falls for Elena amidst the brutal chaos of war, Kristoff must find a way to save her, and himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles, 1989&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;Katie Nelson is going through a divorce and while cleaning out her house and life in the aftermath, she comes across the stamp collection of her father, who recently went into a nursing home. When an appraiser, Benjamin, discovers an unusual World War II-era Austrian stamp placed on an old love letter as he goes through her dad's collection, Katie and Benjamin are sent on a journey together that will uncover a story of passion and tragedy spanning decades and continents, behind the just fallen Berlin Wall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A beautiful, poignant and devastating novel, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Letter&lt;/i&gt; shows the lasting power of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Great War is over, and change is in the air, in this novel that brings to life the exciting days of early British radio…and one woman who finds her voice while working alongside the brilliant women and men of the BBC. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;London, 1926. American-raised Maisie Musgrave is thrilled to land a job as a secretary at the upstart British Broadcasting Corporation, whose use of radio—still new, strange, and electrifying—is captivating the nation. But the hectic pace, smart young staff, and intimidating bosses only add to Maisie’s insecurity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon, she is seduced by the work—gaining confidence as she arranges broadcasts by the most famous writers, scientists, and politicians in Britain. She is also caught up in a growing conflict between her two bosses, John Reith, the formidable Director-General of the BBC, and Hilda Matheson, the extraordinary director of the hugely popular Talks programming, who each have very different visions of what radio should be. Under Hilda’s tutelage, Maisie discovers her talent, passion, and ambition. But when she unearths a shocking conspiracy, she and Hilda join forces to make their voices heard both on and off the air…and then face the dangerous consequences of telling the truth for a living.</description>

She has no choice, but to accept Samson O’Brien as a new tenant for her office space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dismissed from the police force and facing criminal prosecution, Samson has returned to his home town to set up a detective agency while he fights to clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Samson gets his first case, investigating the supposed suicide of a local man, things take an unexpected turn. Soon he is discovering a trail of deaths that lead back to the door of Delilah’s Dales Dating Agency. With suspicion hanging over someone they both care for, the two feuding neighbors soon realize that they need to work together to solve the mystery of the dating deaths. For Samson and Delilah, however, working together is easier said than done.</description>

  <description>It all begins on a Monday, when four people board an elevator in a Manhattan office tower. Each presses a button for their floor, but the elevator proceeds, non-stop, to the top. Once there, it stops for a few seconds, and then plummets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right to the bottom of the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be a horrific, random tragedy. But then, on Tuesday, it happens again, in a different Manhattan skyscraper. And when Wednesday brings yet another high-rise catastrophe, one of the most vertical cities in the world—and the nation’s capital of media, finance, and entertainment—is plunged into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this is anything but random. This is a cold, calculated bid to terrorize the city. And it’s working. Fearing for their lives, thousands of men in women working in offices across the city refuse leave their homes. Commerce has slowed to a trickle. Emergency calls to the top floors of apartment buildings go unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is behind this? Why are they doing it? What do these deadly acts of sabotage have to do with the fingerless body found on the High Line? Two seasoned New York detectives and a straight-shooting journalist must race against time to find the answers before the city’s newest, and tallest, residential tower has its Friday night ribbon-cutting.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the new stand-alone thriller from the World's Bestselling author comes a Police detective by day, celebrity food truck chef by night, now Caleb Rooney has a new title: Most Wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Carnival days leading up Mardi Gras, Detective Caleb Rooney comes under investigation for a murder he is accused of committing in the line of duty--as a Major Crimes detective for the New Orleans Police Department. Has his sideline at the Killer Chef food truck given him a taste for murder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While fighting the charges against him, Rooney makes a pair of unthinkable discoveries. His beloved city is under threat of attack. And these would-be terrorists may be local. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As crowds of revelers gather, Rooney follows a fearsome trail of clues, racing from outlying districts into city center.

  <description>High in the hills of Valencia, a forgotten house guards its secrets. Untouched since Franco's forces tore through Spain in 1936, the whitewashed walls have crumbled, the garden, laden with orange blossom, grown wild. Emma Temple is the first to unlock its doors in seventy years. Guided by a series of letters and a key bequeathed in her mother's will, she has left her job as London's leading perfumier to restore this dilapidated villa to its former glory. It is the perfect retreat: a wilderness redolent with strange and exotic scents, heavy with the colours and sounds of a foreign time. But for her grandmother, Freya, a British nurse who stayed here during Spain's devastating civil war, Emma's new home evokes terrible memories. As the house begins to give up its secrets, Emma is drawn deeper into Freya's story: one of crushed idealism, lost love, and families ripped apart by war. She soon realises it is one thing letting go of the past, but another when it won't let go of you.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;She investigates missing persons—now she is one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private investigator Jessica Shaw is used to getting anonymous tips. But after receiving a photo of a three-year-old kidnapped from Los Angeles twenty-five years ago, Jessica is stunned to recognize the little girl as herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eager for answers, Jessica heads to LA’s dark underbelly. When she learns that her biological mother was killed the night she was abducted, Jessica’s determined to solve a case the police have forgotten. Meanwhile, veteran LAPD detective Jason Pryce is in the midst of a gruesome investigation into a murdered college student moonlighting as a prostitute. A chance encounter leads to them crossing paths, but Jessica soon realizes that Pryce is hiding something about her father’s checkered history and her mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve her mother’s murder and her own disappearance, Jessica must dig into the past and find the secrets buried there. But the air gets thinner as she crawls closer to the truth, and it’s getting harder and harder to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this powerful entry in the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series, Mercy Thompson must face a deadly enemy to defend all she loves...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Mercedes Athena Thompson Hauptman, and I am a car mechanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a coyote shapeshifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the mate of the Alpha of the Columbia Basin werewolf pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, none of that would have gotten me into trouble if, a few months ago, I hadn't stood upon a bridge and taken responsibility for the safety of the citizens who lived in our territory. It seemed like the thing to do at the time. It should have only involved hunting down killer goblins, zombie goats, and an occasional troll. Instead, our home was viewed as neutral ground, a place where humans would feel safe to come and treat with the fae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that nothing and no one is safe. As generals and politicians face off with the Gray Lords of the fae, a storm is coming and her name is Death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we are pack, and we have given our word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will die to keep it.</description>

Ward comes an unforgettable story of passion and vengeance set in the Black Dagger Brotherhood world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ahmare’s brother is abducted, there is nothing she won’t do to get him back safely. She is unprepared, however, for the lengths she will have to go to save his life. Paired with a dangerous but enticing prisoner, she embarks on an odyssey into another world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duran, betrayed by his father, imprisoned in a dungeon for decades, has survived only because of his thirst for vengeance. He has been biding his time to escape and is shocked to find an unlikely and temporary freedom in the form of a determined young female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battling against deadly forces and facing unforeseen peril, the pair are in a race to save Ahmare’s brother.

  <description>Robin Windsor has spent most of her life under an assumed name, running from her family's ignominious past. She thought she'd finally found sanctuary in her rather unremarkable used bookstore just up the street from the marina in River City, Michigan. But the store is struggling and the past is hot on her heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she receives an eerily familiar book in the mail on the morning of her father's scheduled execution, Robin is thrown back to the long-lost summer she met Peter Flynt, the perfect boy who ruined everything. That book--a first edition &lt;i&gt;Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;--is soon followed by the other books she shared with Peter nearly twenty years ago, with one arriving in the mail each day. But why would Peter be making contact after all these years? And why does she have a sinking feeling that she's about to be exposed all over again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With evocative prose that recalls the classic novels we love, Erin Bartels pens a story that shows that words--the ones we say, the ones we read, and the ones we write--have more power than we imagine.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;THE NEW SHORT STORY FROM KARIN SLAUGHTER AND LEE CHILD! &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Jack Reacher and Will Trent&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Twice the action.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Twice the drama.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Double the trouble. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Trent is undercover at Fort Knox. His assignment: to investigate a twenty-two-year-old murder.  His suspect's name: Jack Reacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Reacher is in Fort Knox on his own mission: to bring down a dangerous criminal ring operating at the heart of America’s military.  Except now Will Trent is on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a bigger conspiracy at play – one that neither the special agent nor the ex-military cop could have anticipated. And the only option is for Jack Reacher and Will Trent to team up and play nicely. If they can…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the # 1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/i&gt;, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a &lt;i&gt;good girl&lt;/i&gt; to be a good person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves-and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. &lt;i&gt;At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,&lt;/i&gt; she muses. &lt;i&gt;After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.&lt;/i&gt; Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; is a love story like no other.</description>

  <description>Newly minted FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid is settling into her job in San Antonio, Texas, when the corpse of Harper Worthington, the husband of a sitting congresswoman, is found naked in a motel on the wrong side of town. It’s up to Lucy to locate the last person to see him alive: a teenage prostitute who seems to have vanished into thin air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When forensics determines that Harper was poisoned, Lucy and her new by-the-book partner dig deep into his life to find out who might want him dead. Why did Harper lie to his wife and his staff? Was he involved in an illicit affair? Embezzling money? Laundering money for a drug cartel? Or was he simply a pawn in someone else’s dangerous game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy’s boyfriend, Sean Rogan, is hired by Harper’s company to run a security audit, causing friction between Lucy and the FBI. But when Sean finds a high-tech bug in Harper’s office, an entirely new threat emerges—a far-reaching conspiracy run by a ruthless killer who will do anything to get what he wants, and kill anyone who gets in his way. And the person between him and victory is Lucy Kincaid.</description>

  <description>There is a stranger outside Caroline's house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her spectacular new beach house, built for hosting expensive parties and vacationing with the family she thought she'd have. But her husband is lying to her and everything in her life is upside down, so when the stranger, Aiden, shows up as a bartender at the same party where Caroline and her husband have a very public fight, it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her marriage collapses around her and the lavish lifestyle she's built for herself starts to crumble, Caroline turns to Aiden for comfort...and revenge. After a brief and desperate fling that means nothing to Caroline and everything to him, Aiden's obsession with Caroline, her family, and her house grows more and more disturbing. And when Caroline's husband goes missing, her life descends into a nightmare that leaves her accused of her own husband's murder.</description>

  <description>From the author of the New York Times and USA Today bestselling novel, The Alice Network, comes another fascinating historical novel about a battle-haunted English journalist and a Russian female bomber pilot who join forces to track the Huntress, a Nazi war criminal gone to ground in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of war, the hunter becomes the hunted…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, reckless Nina Markova grows up on the icy edge of Soviet Russia, dreaming of flight and fearing nothing. When the tide of war sweeps over her homeland, she gambles everything to join the infamous Night Witches, an all-female night bomber regiment wreaking havoc on Hitler’s eastern front. But when she is downed behind enemy lines and thrown across the path of a lethal Nazi murderess known as the Huntress, Nina must use all her wits to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;British war correspondent Ian Graham has witnessed the horrors of war from Omaha Beach to the Nuremberg Trials. He abandons journalism after the war to become a Nazi hunter, yet one target eludes him: the Huntress. Fierce, disciplined Ian must join forces with brazen, cocksure Nina, the only witness to escape the Huntress alive. But a shared secret could derail their mission, unless Ian and Nina force themselves to confront it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Jordan McBride grows up in post WWII Boston, determined despite family opposition to become a photographer. At first delighted when her long-widowed father brings home a fiancée, Jordan grows increasingly disquieted by the soft-spoken German widow who seems to be hiding something. Armed only with her camera and her wits, Jordan delves into her new stepmother’s past and slowly realizes there are mysteries buried deep in her family. But Jordan’s search for the truth may threaten all she holds dear.</description>

  <description>When Detroit Free Press reporter Elizabeth Balsam meets James Rich, his strange request--that she look up a relative she didn't know she had in order to deliver an old camera and a box of photos--seems like it isn't worth her time. But when she loses her job after a botched investigation, she suddenly finds herself with nothing but time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At her great-aunt's 150-year-old farmhouse, Elizabeth uncovers a series of mysterious items, locked doors, and hidden graves. As she searches for answers to the riddles around her, the remarkable stories of two women who lived in this very house emerge as testaments to love, resilience, and courage in the face of war, racism, and misunderstanding. And as Elizabeth soon discovers, the past is never as past as we might like to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut novelist Erin Bartels takes readers on an emotional journey through time--from the volatile streets of 1960s Detroit to the Underground Railroad during the Civil War--to uncover the past, confront the seeds of hatred, and discover where love goes to hide.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Althea Bell is still heartbroken by her mother’s tragic, premature death—and tormented by the last, frantic words she whispered into young Althea’s ear: &lt;i&gt;Wait for her. For the honeysuckle girl. She’ll find you, I think, but if she doesn’t, you find her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrift ever since, Althea is now fresh out of rehab and returning to her family home in Mobile, Alabama, determined to reconnect with her estranged, ailing father. While Althea doesn’t expect him, or her politically ambitious brother, to welcome her with open arms, she’s not prepared for the chilling revelation of a grim, long-buried family secret. Fragile and desperate, Althea escapes with an old flame to uncover the truth about her lineage. Drawn deeper into her ancestors’ lives, Althea begins to unearth their disturbing history…and the part she’s meant to play in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping and visceral, this unforgettable debut delves straight into the heart of dark family secrets and into one woman’s emotional journey to save herself from a sinister inheritance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I was issued a warning: stay away from Ben Rosenberg.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clifton Cove’s resident “king”, he thinks he’s entitled to anyone and anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, I’ve spent my whole life following the rules and playing it safe. I know what it feels like to be the good girl. I’m the police chief’s daughter and a librarian—&lt;i&gt;for adorable children&lt;/i&gt;, no less. My wardrobe consists of colorful sundresses and baggy jeans. I might as well have a Post-it stuck to my forehead that reads: &lt;i&gt;Yup, she’s a virgin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-nighter with a fictional hunk is about as exciting as my life gets, until one day, fate decides to take pity on me and shove me straight into the path of Mr. Off-Limits himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oof.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I suspected, every inch of him promises to be my demise. Up close, he’s tall, menacing, dangerously handsome—the type of man who’s never spent a single moment worrying about the opinions of others. A well-behaved girl would do as she’s told and avoid him at all costs, but I’m overdue for a little rebellion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more Friday nights sprawled out on the couch in my comfiest pajamas. No more wishing I had the courage to misbehave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Ben is going to ruin me.&lt;br /&gt;They think he’ll chew me up and spit me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Ben…go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;Tempt me. Taunt me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make me bad.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;We thought the war was over.&lt;br /&gt;We were wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They decimated Earth during the Long Winter.&lt;br /&gt;Now the grid has returned, and they won't stop until the human race is extinct.&lt;br /&gt;On a ruined world, humanity's last survivors fight against impossible odds.&lt;br /&gt;In their darkest hour, they discover a new hope for survival. But it comes at an unthinkable price, with consequences that will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Long Winter, Emma Matthews and James Sinclair hoped life would get back to normal. They've settled down in Camp Seven and welcomed their first child, a daughter. And they have waited and watched the sky for any signs of the grid's return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When NASA discovers that several asteroids have broken from the Kuiper Belt and are headed for Earth, James instantly realizes the truth: the grid is back. And this battle will be one to the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he and his team prepare for humanity's last stand in space and on the ground, Emma makes a discovery closer to home, one that will change life for her and James once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war raging around them, Emma and James fight to keep their family alive. In the cold darkness, humanity splinters. New alliances emerge. At every turn, Emma and James face new dangers--and question whom to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that all hope is lost, James uncovers what may be the key to humanity's survival. But it comes with enormous risks. To implement his plan, he and Emma will have to survive the grid and another, even more deadly enemy. One thing is certain: their gambit will change the future of the human race forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>* &lt;i&gt;Longlisted for the 2019 Wilbur Smith Prize for best published novel&lt;/i&gt;. *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new ice age... and a ground-breaking discovery... will change everything.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the near future, an ice age pushes humanity to the edge of extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists search for the cause--and any hope of stopping the Long Winter. They send probes into the solar system to take readings. Near Mars, one of the probes makes a shocking discovery: a mysterious object, drifting toward the Sun. Is it the cause of the Long Winter? Or could it be our only hope of survival?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, NASA launches a mission to make contact with the artifact. But it isn't what anyone thought. Humanity faces a new kind of threat--and an event that will reveal a dark truth about our future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From A.G. Riddle, the worldwide bestselling author with &lt;b&gt;OVER 4 MILLION COPIES SOLD&lt;/b&gt;, comes a new sci-fi thriller that will forever change the way you look at Earth's place in the solar system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for A.G. Riddle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...reads like a superior collaboration between Dan Brown and Michael Crichton."&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Pandemic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I finished the book fast because I just couldn't wait..."&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;i&gt;WIRED&lt;/i&gt; GeekDad on &lt;i&gt;Departure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Riddle... keep(s) the focus on his characters... rather than the technological marvels"&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;i&gt;Publisher's Weekly&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Departure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well-constructed and tightly-wound as a fine Swiss watch--DEPARTURE has non-stop action, an engaging plot and, of course, wheels within wheels."&lt;br /&gt;-- Diana Gabaldon, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE ABOUT &lt;i&gt;WINTER WORLD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each month, Earth grows colder. Snow falls in summer. Glaciers trample cities across North America, Europe, and Asia. The new ice age shows no signs of stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaos erupts. Around the world, people abandon their homes and flock to regions where they can survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nations prepare to go to war for the world's last habitable zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientific organizations search for the reason Earth is cooling. They send probes into the solar system to collect readings. Near Mars, one of the probes finds a mysterious object, drifting toward the sun. Is it responsible for the new ice age? And if so, can we stop it? Or is the artifact merely an observer? Or neither? Could it be a relic from a long-extinct civilization? One thing is certain: investigating the artifact is humanity's best hope of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the ice age claims more lives and the world slides into anarchy, an international consortium launches a mission into space to study the object and make contact. But the first contact mission doesn't go as planned. What the crew discovers out there is beyond anyone's imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two members of the first contact mission may hold the keys to humanity's salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Emma Matthews is the commander aboard the International Space Station. For months, she has watched the world below freeze and civilization unravel. The headlines tell only half of the story. The messages from her sister tell the rest, of a world witnessing mass migrations, fighting for survival, struggling to provide a future for their children. When a catastrophe strikes the ISS, Emma faces her own fight for survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. James Sinclair is one of the greatest scientists alive. A mind before his time. Years ago, he invented something with the potential to change the world--an invention that would upset the balance of power in the world forever. Fearing that change, his enemies sent him to prison for a crime he didn't commit. But with humanity's future at stake, NASA asks him to join the first contact mission. His expertise is vital to the mission's success--and to saving Emma. With the clock ticking down to humanity's final days on Earth, James makes a decision that will change his life forever and may determine the fate of the entire human race.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Danielle Steel comes the gripping story of a woman who loses everything—her husband, her home, her sense of self and safety, and her freedom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney Wells’s perfect life with her wealthy, devoted husband vanishes when he dies suddenly in an accident. Widowed at forty-nine, she discovers he has failed to include her in his will. With Andrew’s vicious daughters in control of his estate, and no home or money, Sydney finds a job in fashion, despite her own designer daughters’ warnings. Naïve, out of her element, and alone in a world of shady international deals and dishonest people, she is set up by her boss and finds herself faced with criminal prosecution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you lose everything? Husband, safety, protection, money, and reputation gone, faced with prison, she must rebuild her own life from the bottom to the top again, with honor, resourcefulness, and dignity. Sydney finds herself, as well as courage and resilience. Taking life by the horns, she revives her own career as a talented designer, from New York to Hong Kong, risking all in an exotic, unfamiliar world. She is determined to forge a new life she can be proud of.</description>

  <description>Four brides. One Dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of faith, redemption, and timeless love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte owns a chic Birmingham bridal boutique. Dressing brides for their big day is her gift . . . and her passion. But with her own wedding day approaching, why can't she find the perfect dress...or feel certain she should marry Tim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlotte discovers a vintage dress in a battered trunk at an estate sale. It looks brand-new-shimmering with pearls and satin, hand-stitched and timeless in its design. But where did it come from? Who wore it? Who welded the lock shut and tucked the dog tags in that little sachet? Who left it in the basement for a ten-year-old girl? And what about the mysterious man in the purple vest who insists the dress had been "redeemed."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte's search for the gown's history-and its new bride-begins as a distraction from her sputtering love life. But it takes on a life of its own as she comes to know the women who have worn the dress. Emily from 1912. Mary Grace from 1939. Hillary from 1968. Each with her own story of promise, pain, and destiny. And each with something unique to share. For woven within the threads of the beautiful hundred-year-old gown is the truth about Charlotte's heritage, the power of courage and faith, and the timeless beauty of finding true love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They call him the Duke of Ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To an undaunted wallflower, he's just the beast next door.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy and ruthless, Gabriel Duke clawed his way from the lowliest slums to the pinnacle of high society—and now he wants to get even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyal and passionate, Lady Penelope Campion never met a lost or wounded creature she wouldn’t take into her home and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her imposing—and attractive—new neighbor demands she clear out the rescued animals, Penny sets him a challenge. She will part with her precious charges, if he can find them loving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done, Gabriel says. How hard can it be to find homes for a few kittens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a two-legged dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a foul-mouthed parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a goat, an otter, a hedgehog . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done, for a cold-blooded bastard who wouldn’t know a loving home from a workhouse. Soon he’s covered in cat hair, knee-deep in adorable, and bewitched by a shyly pretty spinster who defies his every attempt to resist. Now she’s set her mind and heart on saving him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if he ruins her first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a witty romance about first love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned by her dream job in New York City, sports journalist Neely Kimber suddenly finds herself jobless and paying a long-overdue visit to her hometown in Tennessee. Her plan? Relax, reset, and head back up the corporate ladder. There’s just one unexpected step. Neely’s back in Dogwood Lane for barely a day when she sees the man she ran from nine years ago: the bad boy next door who was her first kiss, her first love, and her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted single dad Dane Madden knows he hurt Neely in the worst way. He’s got a lot to make up for. And as passionate as their reconnection is, it’s a lot to hope for. Having her back in his arms feels so right. But falling in love all over again with a woman who wants to live a world away is bound to go so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s it going to take for Neely to give him—and Dogwood Lane—just one more chance?</description>

  <description>Gideon Crew--brilliant scientist, master thief--is living on borrowed time. When his mysterious employer, Eli Glinn, gives him an eyebrow-raising mission, he has no reason to refuse. Gideon's task: steal a page from the priceless Book of Kells, now on display in New York City and protected by unbreakable security. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accomplishing the impossible, Gideon steals the parchment--only to learn that hidden beneath the gorgeously illuminated image is a treasure map dating back to the time of the ancient Greeks. As they ponder the strange map, they realize that the treasure it leads to is no ordinary fortune. It is something far more precious: an amazing discovery that could perhaps even save Gideon's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with his new partner, Amy, Gideon follows a trail of cryptic clues to an unknown island in a remote corner of the Caribbean Sea. There, off the hostile and desolate Mosquito Coast, the pair realize the extraordinary treasure they are hunting conceals an even greater shock-a revelation so profound that it may benefit the entire human race . . . if Gideon and Amy can survive.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Though she doesn’t want to get married, her grandparents give her no choice. History is repeating itself: Deya’s mother, Isra, also had no choice when she left Palestine as a teenager to marry Adam. Though Deya was raised to believe her parents died in a car accident, a secret note from a mysterious, yet familiar-looking woman makes Deya question everything she was told about her past.

  <description>The new must-read standalone crime thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Widow&lt;/i&gt;, and the Richard &amp;amp; Judy No. 1 bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt; - featuring unforgettable journalist, Kate Waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The police belonged to another world – the world they saw on the television or in the papers. Not theirs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two eighteen-year-old girls go missing on their gap year in Thailand, their families are thrust into the international spotlight: desperate, bereft and frantic with worry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Kate Waters always does everything she can to be first to the story, first with the exclusive, first to discover the truth – and this time is no exception. But she can’t help but think of her own son, who she hasn’t seen in two years since he left home to go traveling. This time it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think . . .</description>

  <description>Content:&lt;br /&gt;- An elderly lady has accommodation problems &lt;br /&gt;- An elderly lady on her travels &lt;br /&gt;- An elderly lady seeks peace at Christmas time &lt;br /&gt;- The antique dealer's death &lt;br /&gt;- An elderly lady is faced with a difficult dilemma&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maud is an irascible 88-year-old Swedish woman with no family, no friends, and…no qualms about a little murder. This funny, irreverent story collection by Helene Tursten, author of the Irene Huss investigations, features two-never-before translated stories that will keep you laughing all the way to the retirement home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her darling father’s untimely death when she was only eighteen, Maud has lived in the family’s spacious apartment in downtown Gothenburg rent-free, thanks to a minor clause in a hastily negotiated contract. That was how Maud learned that good things can come from tragedy. Now in her late eighties, Maud contents herself with traveling the world and surfing the net from the comfort of her father’s ancient armchair. It’s a solitary existence, but she likes it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of her adventures—or misadventures—this little bold lady will handle a crisis with a local celebrity who has her eyes on Maud’s apartment, foil the engagement of her long-ago lover, and dispose of some pesky neighbors. But when the local authorities are called to investigate a murder in her apartment complex, will Maud be able to avoid suspicion, or will Detective Inspector Irene Huss see through her charade?</description>

  <description>During the worst blizzard in memory, an FBI agent in a moving SUV in New York City is killed by a nearly impossible sniper shot. Unable to pinpoint where the shot came from, as the storm rapidly wipes out evidence, the agent-in-charge Brett Kehoe turns to the one man who might be able to help them--former FBI agent Lucas Page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Page, a university professor and bestselling author, left the FBI years ago after a tragic event robbed him of a leg, an arm, an eye, and the willingness to continue. But he has an amazing ability to read a crime scene, figure out angles and trajectories in his head, and he might be the only one to be able to find the sniper's nest. With a new wife and family, Lucas Page has no interest in helping the FBI--except for the fact that the victim was his former partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to help for his partner's sake, Page finds himself hunting a killer with an unknown agenda and amazing sniper skills in the worst of conditions. And his partner's murder is only the first in a series of meticulously planned murders carried out with all-but-impossible sniper shots. The only thing connecting the deaths is that the victims are all with law enforcement--that is until Page's own family becomes a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To identify and hunt down this ruthless, seemingly unstoppable killer, Page must discover what hidden past connects the victims before he himself loses all that is dear to him.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gripping thriller about three young girlfriends, a dark obsession and a chilling crime that shakes up a quiet Iowa town, from the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Weight of Silence&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For twelve-year-old Cora Landry and her friends Violet and Jordyn, it was supposed to be an ordinary sleepover--movies and Ouija and talking about boys. But when they decide to sneak out to go to the abandoned rail yard on the outskirts of town, little do they know that their innocent games will have dangerous consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night, Cora Landry is discovered on the tracks, bloody and clinging to life, her friends nowhere to be found. Soon their small rural town is thrust into a maelstrom. Who would want to hurt a young girl like Cora--and why? In an investigation that leaves no stone unturned, everyone is a suspect and no one can be trusted--not even those closest to Cora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before She Was Found&lt;/i&gt; is a timely and gripping thriller about friendship and betrayal, about the power of social pressure and the price of needing to fit in. It is about the great lengths a parent will go to protect their child and keep them safe--even if that means burying the truth, no matter the cost.</description>

  <description>Renée Knight follows up her international sensation &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt; with this shivery tale of psychological suspense, featuring a character as disturbing and compelling as Mrs. Danvers in Daphne Du Maurier’s &lt;em&gt;Rebecca.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her first day as Personal Assistant to the celebrated Mina Appleton, Christine Butcher understands what is expected of her. Absolute loyalty. Absolute discretion. For twenty years, Christine has been a most devoted servant, a silent witness to everything in Mina’s life. So quiet, you would hardly know she is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day after day, year after year, Christine has been there, invisible—watching, listening, absorbing all the secrets floating around her. Keeping them safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christine is trusted. But those years of loyalty and discretion come with a high price. And eventually Christina will pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, it would be a mistake to underestimate such a steadfast woman. Because as everyone is about to discover, there’s a dangerous line between obedience and obsession.</description>

  <description>‘Welcome to the escape room. Your goal is simple. Get out alive.’ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the lucrative world of Wall Street finance, Vincent, Jules, Sylvie and Sam are the ultimate high-flyers. Ruthlessly ambitious, they make billion-dollar deals and live lives of outrageous luxury. Getting rich is all that matters, and they'll do anything to get ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the four of them become trapped in an elevator escape room, things start to go horribly wrong. They have to put aside their fierce office rivalries and work together to solve the clues that will release them. But in the confines of the elevator the dark secrets of their team are laid bare. They are made to answer for profiting from a workplace where deception, intimidation and sexual harassment thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempers fray and the escape room’s clues turn more and more ominous, leaving the four of them dangling on the precipice of disaster. If they want to survive, they’ll have to solve one final puzzle: which one of them is a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Fantastic – one of my favorite books of the year.' Lee Child</description>

When Tuva Moodyson investigates the story that could make her career she stumbles on a web of secrets that knit Gavrik town together.

  <description>Every Winter, the human population hibernates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During those bitterly cold four months, the nation is a snow-draped landscape of desolate loneliness, and devoid of human activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your name is Charlie Worthing and it's your first season with the Winter Consuls, the committed but mildly unhinged group of misfits who are responsible for ensuring the hibernatory safe passage of the sleeping masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are investigating an outbreak of viral dreams which you dismiss as nonsense; nothing more than a quirky artefact borne of the sleeping mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dreams start to kill people, it's unsettling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the dreams too, it's weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they start to come true, you begin to doubt your sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But teasing truth from Winter is never easy: You have to avoid the Villains and their penchant for murder, kidnapping and stamp collecting, ensure you aren't eaten by Nightwalkers whose thirst for human flesh can only be satisfied by comfort food, and sidestep the increasingly less-than-mythical WinterVolk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so long as you remember to wrap up warmly, you'll be fine.</description>

  <description>This collection has five clean romances in it. They are full books, not samples or novellas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book 1: Accidentally Married&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Madison get swindled into pretending to be Jared's girlfriend for a family dinner. When she finds out he lied to her, she gets him back by telling his family they are engaged. A hilarious rom com with a great cast of characters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Book 2: Reluctantly Married&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Megan and Adam have knocked heads for some time. When forced to pretend to date on a TV show, real feelings get in the way. And when they say I do, Megan worries her heart will not be able to take it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Book 3: Mistakenly Married&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things get a little crazy when Penny accidentally marries the wrong man. Then when he convinces her to stay married just until he gets his inheritance, she agrees.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next charming mystery from Carolyn Haines featuring spunky southern private investigator Sarah Booth Delaney. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a ritually murdered corpse is discovered at the new-found Native-American temple site smack in the middle of Sunflower County, Mississippi, the archaeology crew on the dig is immediately under suspicion -- with particular focus on its handsome, flirtatious leader, Dr. Frank Hafner. So when Sheriff Coleman Peters closes in on him, Hafner does the only logical thing: he hires the Delaney Detective Agency to clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors swirl around Mount Salla, the burial mound created centuries before by the local Native tribes, and no one is sure what the site contains -- bones, pottery, treasures, or a curse -- but the victims start to add up. Sarah Booth and her partner, Tinkie, have too many likely suspects to whittle down the list. It's a race against time once Sarah Booth's resident ghost, Jitty, in the guise of various Native American warrior women, points to the waxing of the coming Crow Moon as the time of maximum danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death and mystery cloak the site, and Sarah Booth isn't sure who to trust or what to believe. But she won't rest until she's dug up the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man's disappearance throws four women's lives into chaos--who will survive?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki works as an aromatherapist, healing her clients out of her home studio with her special blends of essential oils. She's just finishing a session when the police arrive on her doorstep--her ex-husband David has gone missing. Vicki insists she last saw him years ago when they divorced, but the police clearly don't believe her. And her memory's hardly reliable--what if she &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have something to do with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Scarlet and her mother Zelda are down on their luck, and at eight years old, Scarlet's not old enough to know that the "game" her mother forces her to play is really just a twisted name for dealing drugs. Soon, Zelda is caught, and Scarlet is forced into years of foster care--an experience that will shape the rest of her life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David's new wife, Tanya, is the one who reported him missing, but what really happened on the night of David's disappearance? And how can Vicki prove her innocence, when she's not even sure of it herself? The answer lies in the connection among these four women--and the one person they can't escape.</description>

  <description>In the most explosive and twisted psychological thriller since &lt;i&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/i&gt;, a beautiful marriage turns beautifully bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things that make me scared: When Charlie cries. Hospitals and lakes. When Ian drinks vodka in the basement. ISIS. When Ian gets angry... That something is really, really wrong with me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie and Ian's romance began with a chance encounter at a party overseas; he was serving in the British army and she was a travel writer visiting her best friend, Jo. Now almost two decades later, married with a beautiful son, Charlie, they are living the perfect suburban life in Middle America. But when a camping accident leaves Maddie badly scarred, she begins attending writing therapy, where she gradually reveals her fears about Ian's PTSD; her concerns for the safety of their young son, Charlie; and the couple's tangled and tumultuous past with Jo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Balkans to England, Iraq to Manhattan, and finally to an ordinary family home in Kansas, sixteen years of love and fear, adventure and suspicion culminate in The Day of the Killing, when a frantic 911 call summons the police to the scene of a shocking crime.</description>

  <description>A seemingly perfect marriage is threatened by the deadly secrets husband and wife keep from each other, for fans of B.A. Paris and Paula Hawkins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susannah, a young widow and single mother, has remarried well: to Max, a charismatic artist and popular speaker whose career took her and her fifteen-year-old son out of New York City and to a quiet Vermont university town. Strong-willed and attractive, Susannah expects that her life is perfectly in place again. Then one quiet morning she finds a note on her door: I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max dismisses the note as a prank. But days after a neighborhood couple comes to dinner, the husband mysteriously dies in a tragic accident while on a run with Max. Soon thereafter, a second note appears on their door: DID YOU GET AWAY WITH IT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Susannah and Max are keeping secrets from the world and from each other —secrets that could destroy their family and everything they have built. &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Liar&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling novel told through the alternating perspectives of Susannah and Max with a shocking climax that no one will expect, from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Headmaster’s Wife&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>When a mysterious text message summons May Wexler to a biker bar in downtown New Orleans, she knows something is very wrong. Her sister has sent out an SOS, but when May gets there, she’s nowhere to be found and May is the one in trouble—she’s wearing pink espadrilles, she’s got a Chihuahua in her purse, and she’s in the middle of a shootout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tall, muscular Ozzie comes to her rescue, May has no choice but to follow him to safety. At the headquarters of his private security firm, the Bourbon Street Boys, she finds a refuge for the night—and the offer of a job. But it’s not long before a gun-toting stalker isn’t the only complication in May’s life: the more time she spends with Ozzie, the less she can deny that they’ve got some serious chemistry. A wrong number got her into this mess…Will it also get her the right guy?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Truths and Roses &lt;br /&gt;First love. Second chances. Secrets with the power to change lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Will Kincaid’s professional football career comes to an abrupt end in a single night, he’s left to figure out what he’s going to do with the rest of his life. He heads home to the small Virginia town where he grew up and crosses paths with Hannah Jacobs, the only girl in high school who had ever rejected him. It’s Hannah who once made him question the choices he had made, and it’s Hannah who’s making him question them all over again. But with the weight of a secret he’s managed to hide from the world his entire adult life hanging over him, he can’t afford to question his choices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hannah Jacobs had once made the choice to deny her feelings for Will Kincaid, at the time finding it the only possible option for a young girl intent on burying a nightmare she only wanted to forget. The life she’s made for herself as a librarian in Lake Perdue is a quiet one, and she’s hardly prepared for the day when Will rams his fancy Ferrari into her dependable old clunker. But for Hannah, Will Kincaid can only stir up memories she had long ago put away forever. And there’s nothing at all good that can come from bringing them back to life again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nashville - Part One - Ready to Reach &lt;br /&gt;Nineteen-year old CeCe Mackenzie leaves Virginia for Nashville with not much more to her name than a guitar, a Walker Hound named Hank Junior and an old car she'd inherited from her grandma called Gertrude. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Gertrude ends up on the side of I-40 in flames, and Nashville has never seemed farther away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Help arrives in the form of two Georgia football players headed for the Nashville dream as well. When Holden Ashford and Thomas Franklin stop to offer CeCe and Hank Junior a ride, fate may just give a nod to serendipity and meant to be.</description>

  <description>Billionaire CEO Luke Ryder doesn’t want to hire his best friend, Brooke, as his matchmaker. Not when he’s been in love with her for eight years. Too bad she doesn’t see him as relationship material and is engaged to another man. If the matchmaking company she works for closes, Brooke is out of a job, and Luke is out a best friend. There will be nothing stopping her from moving to Italy with her fiancé. And Luke isn’t about to let that happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke’s dream career may be crumbling, and she will do anything to keep Toujour in the black. Even recruit Luke, America’s favorite bachelor, as her next client. Surely his perfect smile and swollen bank account will send clients swarming to their doors. But when matching up Luke works a little too well, Brooke wonders if she’s with the right man. Maybe she should finally forget Luke’s playboy image and admit he’s changed. All Brooke has to decide is if she’s willing to risk her heart.</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling Author Ginny Baird, a heartwarming story about the power of love, the dedication of family, and the realization of dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Get 13 sweet love stories all in one!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginny Baird's The Calendar Brides &lt;br /&gt;Twelve granddaughters share one goal, all in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve women with big hearts and slim wallets want to do something special for their grandmother. At eighty-seven, the family matriarch has reconnected with her childhood sweetheart, and wants to elope to Sicily. The catch is her intended is poor, and Mama D'Amato doesn't have the travel cash herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they put their heads together, can her twelve granddaughters help their Nona achieve her dream? All it takes is a little ingenuity and a very clever plan. Meet Emma, Claire, Angie, Haley, Bev, Jane, Tiny, Zoe, Lena, Trish, Susan and Rachel, as they embark on the adventure of a lifetime--all in the name of l'amore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the D'Amato women and their men! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma is the oldest and a smart mouth. She loves late-night pizza, her puppy, and Donny--whom she hated in high school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma's sweet sister Claire reports the weather and collects seashells. Brainy Brad helps her see stars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay-at-home mom Angie pretends to Zumba. Hot hubby Jason doesn't miss a step. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angie's athletic twin Haley is a baker on the move. Mountain biker Peter grooves with her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World traveler Bev craves adventure. Photojournalist Will has a passport, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane is a serious-minded thinker. Dry-witted Richard makes her laugh--and sigh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feisty Tiny has loved Jimmy for decades. Now, they're building a future together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny's artist sister Zoe has a secret wish. Does sexy Dillon share it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bev's sister Lena sings for her supper. Unconventional Randy digs her act. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only child Trish speaks her mind. Laid-back Leo knows how to listen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane's shy sister Susan is a lonely knitter... Then handsome Kyle smiles her way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel is the baby and a dreamer. Kindly, older Tom wants to give her the moon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucia vowed to marry Luigi at fourteen. He still waits for her in Italy. It's never too late for love! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join them all in this lively, romantic tale, just in time for the New Year! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginny Baird's The Calendar Brides&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Releasing January 2015</description>

  <description>They say your first kiss should be earned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine were broken before we left church. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say your heart only beats for one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father’s sins over his head to force me into marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;Three lives. &lt;br /&gt;Entwined together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.</description>

  <description>Georgeanne Howard, charm school graduate and Southern belle extraordinaire, leaves her fiancé at the altar when she realizes she just can't marry a man old enough to be her grandfather, no matter how rich he is. John Kowalsky unknowingly helps her escape, and only when it's too late does he realize that he's absconded with his boss's bride. At the height of his hockey career, this bad boy isn't looking to be anybody's savior but his own, no matter how beautiful this angel may be. But a long night stretches ahead of them--a night too sultry to resist temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Georgeanne and John meet again, she is on her way to becoming Seattle's domestic darling and he is past his hellraising days. But he is shocked to learn that their single unforgettable night in paradise produced a daughter, and he is determined to be part of her life. Georgeanne has loved John since the moment she jumped into his little red Corvette seven years ago, but she doesn't want to risk her heart again. Is he really a changed man? And will he risk the wrath of his boss, and one final chance at glory, to prove that this time his love will be everlasting?</description>

  <description>Four years ago, air force sweethearts Franci Duncan and Sean Riordan reached an impasse. She wanted marriage and a family. He didn't. But a chance meeting proves that the bitter breakup hasn't cooled their sizzling chemistry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean has settled down in spite of himself—he's not the cocky young fighter pilot he was when Franci left, and he wants them to try again. After all, they have a history... but that's not all they share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franci's secret reason for walking away when Sean refused to commit is now three and a half: a redheaded cherub named Rosie who shares her daddy's emerald-green eyes. Sean is stunned—and furious with Franci for the deception. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News travels fast in Virgin River, and soon the whole town is taking sides. Rebuilding their trust could take a small miracle—and the kind of love that can move mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording (11 hours, 18 minutes).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes an unexpected love story of secondhand hearts and second chances…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with a mysterious blue note sewn into a wedding dress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something blue. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d gone to sell my own unworn bridal gown at a vintage clothing store. That’s when I found another bride’s “something old.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stitched into the lining of a fabulously feathered design was the loveliest message I’d ever read: &lt;i&gt;Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name embossed on the blue stationery: &lt;i&gt;Reed Eastwood&lt;/i&gt;, obviously the most romantic man who ever lived. I also discovered he’s the most gorgeous. If only my true-love fantasies had stopped there. Because I’ve since found out something else about Mr. Starry-Eyed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s arrogant, cynical, and demanding. I should know. Thanks to a twist of fate, he’s my new boss. But that’s not going to stop me from discovering the story behind his last love letter. A love letter that did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; result in a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; story is nothing compared to the one unfolding between us. It’s getting hotter, sweeter, and more surprising than anything I could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something new. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have no idea how this one is going to end...</description>

  <description>Tess Dougherty plans every aspect of her life right down to the last detail. But she doesn’t plan on running her boyfriend off by bringing up the topic of marriage before he’s ready. And she doesn’t plan to lose her job on the day she’s set to receive a huge promotion. So when her perfect world unravels, Tess makes a new plan: disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess packs her bags and leaves her city apartment for a remote vineyard in North Carolina. At first, she’s put off by the slow pace of small-town life in the South. She’s especially irritated by Thatcher, the vineyard’s smart-mouth, dimple-faced farmhand. But she soon begins to appreciate the area’s charm, and Thatcher’s charm, too. She even swaps her trademark heels for a pair of cowboy boots. As Tess spends more time getting to know Thatcher, she finds herself loosening her grip on her old life little by little. Unfortunately, things on the vineyard aren’t as simple as they seem. There’s a secret here, and when the truth comes to light, Tess is forced to reconsider every plan she’s ever made.</description>

  <description>Waitress and single mom Jessica “Jessie” Mann is practical to a fault. Even if she had time to date, which she doesn’t, she’d be determined to provide her son with a more secure upbringing than the one she had—and that would mean a husband with big bucks. When Jack Morrison—a sexy-as-sin, seemingly broke customer with a cowboy hat and a seductive grin—tries to flirt with her, she shoots him down. She doubts a carefree dreamer like Jack can provide the financial stability she needs. Yet with Christmas just weeks away, and Jessie not wanting to spend it alone, the charming Texan is proving hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the heir to the Morrison luxury hotel empire, Jack is used to being fawned over. But Jack needs someone who will fall in love with him—not his wealth. He’s set his sights on Jessie, though her hardened heart just might get in the way…To be sure, he conceals his true identity and offers to help Jessie find the rich husband she seeks. But Jack’s daring charade may rob him of the holiday wish he wants most of all…</description>

  <description>Molly Bishop loves living in Manhattan and managing a boutique luxury hotel. She's about to be promoted to her dream job of General Manager, the role she's been striving for her entire career. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's only one thing standing in her way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The will of her childhood friend, Christian Ford's grandfather. She hasn't even seen Christian in over ten years, but a recent run-in with his grandfather during a rare visit home, resulted in a new condition to the will. Christian will only inherit the ranch he's been running and the real estate development business that he has expanded, if he marries Molly and stays married for at least six months.</description>

  <description> Can one summer together make up for eight years of separation?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Commander Brett Murphy left his family’s construction firm in Oklahoma City for a life of hard work at Three Rivers Ranch. Alone, without a wife and kids, Brett needs the camaraderie he enjoyed while serving overseas with his Army buddies, Squire Ackerman and Peter Marshall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Brett doesn’t need is the reappearance of his ex-wife. Fiery Kate Donnely has come to Three Rivers to confess to Brett that they’re still married, and oh, he has a seven-year-old son she never told him about. At least not in letters she mailed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eight years ago, Kate left Oklahoma City only weeks after Brett’s first deployment, shamed because of her bad choices and the unborn child of a man she’d already asked for a divorce. She needs him to sign the papers now or she can’t have access to her hefty inheritance. But Brett absolutely does not want Kate to take his son away from him again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They strike a deal: She’ll stay at Three Rivers for the summer so Brett can have the opportunity to get to know his son. How far will they have to go and how much will they have to forgive in order to become a family? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A man's quest to find answers for those who are haunted by the past leads him deeper into the shadows in this electrifying novel from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Promise Not to Tell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinton Zane is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Lancaster, consultant to the FBI, has always been drawn to the coldest of cold cases, the kind that law enforcement either considers unsolvable or else has chalked up to accidents or suicides. As a survivor of a fire, he finds himself uniquely compelled by arson cases. His almost preternatural ability to get inside the killer's head has garnered him a reputation in some circles--and complicated his personal life. The more cases Jack solves, the closer he slips into the darkness. His only solace is Winter Meadows, a meditation therapist. After particularly grisly cases, Winter can lead Jack back to peace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as long as Quinton Zane is alive, Jack will not be at peace for long. Having solidified his position as the power behind the throne of his biological family's hedge fund, Zane sets out to get rid of Anson Salinas's foster sons, starting with Jack.</description>

  <description>Nikki Griffin isn't your typical private investigator. In her office above her bookstore’s shelves and stacks, where she luxuriates in books and the comfort they provide, she also tracks certain men. Dangerous men. Men who have hurt the women they claim to love. And Nikki likes to teach those men a lesson, to teach them what it feels like to be hurt and helpless, so she can be sure that their victims are safe from them forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a regular PI job tailing Karen, a tech company's disgruntled employee who might be selling secrets, turns ugly and Karen's life is threatened, Nikki has to break cover and intervene. Karen tells Nikki that there are people after her. Dangerous men. She says she'll tell Nikki what's really going on. But then something goes wrong, and suddenly Nikki is no longer just solving a case—she's trying hard to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part Lisbeth Salander, part Jack Reacher, part Jessica Jones, Nikki Griffin is a kickass character who readers will root for as she seeks to right the world's wrongs. S.A. Lelchuk’s &lt;i&gt;Save Me From Dangerous Men&lt;/i&gt; marks the beginning of a gripping new series and the launch of a fabulous new character.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt; in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My daughter learned to walk in a homeless shelter."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the gap between upper middle-class Americans and the working poor widens, grueling low-wage domestic and service work--primarily done by women--fuels the economic success of the wealthy. Stephanie Land worked for years as a maid, pulling long hours while struggling as a single mom to keep a roof over her daughter's head. In &lt;i&gt;Maid,&lt;/i&gt; she reveals the dark truth of what it takes to survive and thrive in today's inequitable society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she worked hard to scratch her way out of poverty as a single parent, scrubbing the toilets of the wealthy, navigating domestic labor jobs, higher education, assisted housing, and a tangled web of government assistance, Stephanie wrote. She wrote the true stories that weren't being told. The stories of overworked and underpaid Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in honest, heart-rending prose and with great insight, &lt;i&gt;Maid&lt;/i&gt; explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. "I'd become a nameless ghost," Stephanie writes. With this book, she gives voice to the "servant" worker, those who fight daily to scramble and scrape by for their own lives and the lives of their children.</description>

  <description>In her career as an Army intelligence officer, Amy Cornwall has seen haunting sights half a world away. None compare to the chilling scene at her Virginia home. A phone rings with a terrifying ultimatum: locate and liberate an unnamed captive in forty-eight hours, or her kidnapped husband and ten-year-old daughter are dead. Now, and in open defiance of Army Command, Amy must employ every lethal tactic she has to save them. To succeed, she must discover not only who dispatched her on this mission, but why. Without her family, she's dead either way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Erin Kelly, the masterful author of &lt;i&gt;He Said/She Said&lt;/i&gt;, delivers another irresistible, unputdownable novel of psychological suspense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't keep &lt;b&gt;the secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't tell &lt;b&gt;the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't escape &lt;b&gt;the past&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne was seventeen when she fled her home in Nusstead – leaving behind her family, her boyfriend, Jesse, and the body they buried. Now, thirty years later, forced to return to in order to help care for her sick mother, she can feel the past closing around her. And Jesse, who never forgave her for leaving in the first place, is finally threatening to expose the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne will do anything to protect the life she's built, the husband and daughter who must never know what happened all those years ago. Even if it means turning to her worst enemy for help... But Marianne may not know the whole story – and she isn't the only one with secrets they'd kill to keep.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Stone Barrington uncovers a societal minefield in the exhilarating new adventure from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author Stuart Woods.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an old acquaintance reaches out to Stone Barrington requesting assistance, the job seems easy enough. She needs an expert in an esoteric field, someone with both the knowledge and careful dexterity to solve a puzzle. But the solution to one small problem blows the lid open on a bigger scandal going back decades, and involving numerous prominent New Yorkers who would prefer the past stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this explosive information in-hand, Stone Barrington is caught between a rock and a hard place, his only options either to play it safe to the detriment of others, or to see justice done and risk fatal exposure. But when it comes to Stone Barrington, danger is usually just around the corner... so he may as well throw caution to the wind.</description>

  <description>Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?</description>

  <description>A shocking accident. A little girl struggling to survive. And the childless aunt who transforms her own world to help her . . . Danielle Steel’s latest novel is a deeply moving story of resilience and hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige Watts is the ultimate stage mother. The daughter of Hollywood royalty, Paige channels her acting dreams into making her own daughter, Emma, a star. By the age of nine, Emma is playing a central role in a hit TV show. Then everything is shattered by unforeseeable tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Emma is living with her aunt Whitney, who had chosen a very different path from her sister’s. Whitney was always the studious older sister, hating the cult of celebrity that enveloped their childhood. Instead, she is a psychiatrist who lives for her work and enjoys a no-strings-attached love affair with a wealthy venture capitalist. But at a moment’s notice, Whitney drops everything to help her niece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once famous, outgoing, and charismatic, Emma is now a shadow of her former self—without speech, without memory, lost and terrified. But with her aunt Whitney’s help, along with a team of caregivers and doctors, Emma begins to find her way, starting her young life all over again—and changing the lives of everyone around her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this moving story two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within five feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Don’t miss #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.R. Ward’s three-part ebook serialization: &lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell&lt;/i&gt;. This exclusive prequel to her upcoming standalone suspense &lt;i&gt;Consumed &lt;/i&gt;(available in October 2018&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; takes us back to where it all started between arson investigator Anne Ashburn and ‘bad boy’ firefighter Danny Maguire. &lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell&lt;/i&gt; is a sexy standalone novella that sets up C&lt;i&gt;onsumed&lt;/i&gt;’s storyline, leaving fans hungry for more and dying to snatch it up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell, Part 1: The Rehearsal Dinner&lt;/i&gt;: It’s a classic recipe for disaster: Take one bridesmaid who thinks pink is the root of all evil, mix with a best man who’s hotter than a four-alarm fire, add in their explosive sexual attraction, a nightmare bridezilla, two cat fights, and an emergency call, and you have the wedding from hell.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Experience the sizzling start of Anne and Danny’s intense relationship. Is this the start of something good...or just an erotic one-night stand that rocks their world, but must never be repeated?</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Sister, the Serial Killer &lt;/i&gt;is a blackly comic novel about how blood is thicker - and more difficult to get out of the carpet - than water...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Korede's dinner is interrupted one night by a distress call from her sister, Ayoola, she knows what's expected of her: bleach, rubber gloves, nerves of steel and a strong stomach. This'll be the third boyfriend Ayoola's dispatched in, quote, self-defence and the third mess that her lethal little sibling has left Korede to clear away. She should probably go to the police for the good of the menfolk of Nigeria, but she loves her sister and, as they say, family always comes first. Until, that is, Ayoola starts dating the doctor where Korede works as a nurse. Korede's long been in love with him, and isn't prepared to see him wind up with a knife in his back: but to save one would mean sacrificing the other...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel tells the uplifting story of an ordinary woman embracing an extraordinary adventure, and the daring choice that transforms her world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winona Farmington once dreamed of graduating from college, moving to New York City, and pursuing a career in publishing. Then real life got in the way when she left college and returned to her small Michigan hometown to care for her sick mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, stuck in a dead-end job and an unsatisfying relationship, Winnie has concluded that dreams were meant for others. She consoles herself with binge-watching the British television series that she loves, Beauchamp Hall, enthralled by the sumptuous period drama set on a great Norfolk estate in the 1920s. The rich upstairs-downstairs world brilliantly brought to life by superb actors is the ultimate in escapism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day Winnie is passed over for a long-overdue promotion, she is also betrayed by her boyfriend and her best friend. Heartbroken, she makes the first impulsive decision of her conventional life—which changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She packs her bags and flies to England to see the town where Beauchamp Hall is filmed. The quaint B &amp;amp; B where she stays feels like home. The brother and sister who live in the castle where the show is filmed, rich in titles but poor in cash, are more like long-lost friends than British nobility. And the show itself, with its colorful company and behind-the-scenes affairs, is a drama all its own. Winnie’s world comes alive on the set of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens next is the stuff of dreams, as Winnie takes the boldest leap of all. Beauchamp Hall reminds us to follow our dreams. . . . You never know what magic will happen!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

  <description>In the venerable history of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, only one male has ever been expelled—but Murhder’s insanity gave the Brothers no choice. Haunted by visions of a female he could not save, he nonetheless returns to Caldwell on a mission to right the wrong that ruined him. However, he is not prepared for what he must face in his quest for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Sarah Watkins, researcher at a biomedical firm, is struggling with the loss of her fellow scientist fiancé. When the FBI starts asking about his death, she questions what really happened and soon learns the terrible truth: Her firm is conducting inhumane experiments in secret and the man she thought she knew and loved was involved in the torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Murhder and Sarah’s destinies become irrevocably entwined, desire ignites between them. But can they forge a future that spans the divide separating the two species? And as a new foe emerges in the war against the vampires, will Murhder return to his Brothers... or resume his lonely existence forevermore?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a new short story available exclusively as an ebook, Jack Reacher’s spending the holidays in California. The last thing he expects is a blizzard—or a visit from the world’s deadliest assassin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss a thrilling preview of Lee Child’s highly anticipated new Jack Reacher novel, &lt;i&gt;Past Tense&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; On Christmas Eve, Jack Reacher stumbles into a no-name bar in the California desert, desperate to take refuge from an unexpected snowstorm. Reacher came to Barstow for a little R&amp;amp;R. Instead, he’s sequestered in a dark little roadhouse with a bartender, a bewildered elderly couple—and two members of Britain’s Royal Military Police. They tell Reacher they were escorting a VIP to a top-secret meeting at a U.S. military base when they became separated from their charge. That’s when the threat came in from a notorious assassin: the Christmas Scorpion. Now they need a miracle to save the day. Or maybe all they need is Jack Reacher.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This time it's Alex Cross on trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Alex Cross is on the wrong side of the law. Serving a suspension from the force while he awaits trial for murder, Cross has been branded as a trigger-happy cop, another bad apple walking the streets with a gun, an accusation that Cross will do anything to refute. To make himself feel useful again, Cross opens a counseling office in the basement of his home. When his former partner Sampson shows up needing his help, Cross jumps at the chance, even if it may end up costing him what's left of his career. When a string of young, blonde women go missing, the investigation leads Cross and Sampson to the most depraved, darkest corners of the internet. Struggling to prove his own innocence and uncover the truth lurking online, Cross must risk everything to save his most at-risk patient of all...himself.&lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci introduces a remarkable new character: Atlee Pine, an FBI special agent assigned to the remote wilds of the western United States. Ever since her twin sister was abducted by a notorious serial killer at age five, Atlee has spent her life hunting down those who hurt others. And she’s the best at it. She could be one of the Bureau’s top criminal profilers, if she didn’t prefer catching criminals in the vast wilderness of the West to climbing the career ladder in the D.C. office. Her chosen mission is a lonesome one–but that suits her just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Atlee is called in to investigate the mutilated carcass of a mule found in the Grand Canyon–and hopefully, solve the disappearance of its rider. But this isn’t the only recent disappearance. In fact, it may be just the first clue, the key to unraveling a rash of other similar missing persons cases in the canyon. . .</description>

  <description>EVEN THE DEAD WANT REVENGE! Cliburn Plantation is a ruin. Cursed by a voodoo priestess because of the cruelty of Ezekiel Cliburn, it’s home to the ghosts of Haitian mourners, slaves, river pirates, and tragedy. When Jitty, the resident ghost of Dahlia House and Sarah Booth Delaney’s nemesis and friend, asks for help, Sarah Booth takes on the nether world in this creepy Halloween tale. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jitty’s husband, who was killed in the Civil War, has disappeared from the Great Beyond. He’s on a mission of revenge that will get him banished from the heavenly world, unless Sarah Booth can stop him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On All Hallow’s Eve, when the veil between living and dead is thinnest, Sarah Booth travels to the old plantation to halt a showdown between Coker and the last living heir of the Cliburn family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Coker and Thom Cliburn face off on the dusty road that fronts the slave quarters of the old plantation, can Sarah Booth save Jitty’s man? Can she survive an encounter no living person should ever see?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A gripping story of friendship and betrayal from international best-selling author Adele Parks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;‘I invited her in… and she took everything.’ &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mel hears from a long-lost friend in need of help, she doesn’t hesitate to invite her to stay. Mel and Abi were best friends back in the day, sharing the highs and lows of student life, until Mel’s unplanned pregnancy made her drop out of her studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, seventeen years later, Mel and Abi’s lives couldn’t be more different. Mel is happily married, having raised her son on her own before meeting her husband, Ben. Now they share gorgeous girls and have a chaotic but happy family home, with three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abi, meanwhile, followed her lover to LA for a glamorous life of parties, celebrity and indulgence. Everything was perfect, until she discovered her partner had been cheating on her. Seventeen years wasted, and nothing to show for it. So what Abi needs now is a true friend to lean on, to share her grief over a glass of wine, and to have some time to heal. And what better place than Mel’s house, with her lovely kids, and supportive husband…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dark, unsettling tale of the reunion of long-lost friends is thoroughly gripping exploration of wanting what you can’t have, jealousy and revenge from&lt;em&gt; Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Adele Parks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A legendary hotel on the Pacific becomes a haven where dreams, love, and a beguiling mystery come alive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1958. Kate Morgan, tethered to her family’s failing San Francisco restaurant, is looking for an escape. She gets her chance by honoring a cryptic plea from her grandfather: &lt;i&gt;find the beautiful stranger&lt;/i&gt;. The search takes her to Hotel del Coronado, the beachfront landmark on the Southern California coast where filming is underway on the movie &lt;i&gt;Some Like It Hot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a movie lover like Kate, it’s a fantasy come true. So is the offer of a position at the glamorous hotel. And a new romance is making her heart beat just as fast. But as sure as she is that the Coronado is her future, Kate discovers it’s also where the ghosts of the past have come to stay. Sixty years ago a guest died tragically, and she still haunts the hotel’s halls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the lives of two women—generations apart—intertwine, Kate’s courageous journey could change more than she ever imagined. And with the Coronado wending its way through her soul, she must follow her dreams…wherever they may lead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two hearts. Twice as vulnerable.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manhattan, 1850. Born out of wedlock to a wealthy socialite and a nameless immigrant, Cora Lee can mingle with the rich just as easily as she can slip unnoticed into the slums and graveyards of the city. As the only female resurrectionist in New York, she’s carved out a niche procuring bodies afflicted with the strangest of anomalies. Anatomists will pay exorbitant sums for such specimens—dissecting and displaying them for the eager public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora’s specialty is not only profitable, it’s a means to keep a finger on the pulse of those searching for &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. She’s the girl born with two hearts—a legend among grave robbers and anatomists—sought after as an endangered prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a series of murders unfolds closer and closer to Cora, she can no longer trust those she holds dear, including the young medical student she’s fallen for. Because someone has no intention of waiting for Cora to die a natural death.</description>

  <description>Just beyond the Gilded Age, in the mist-covered streets of New York, the deadly Spanish influenza ripples through the city. But with so many victims in her close circle, young socialite Allene questions if the flu is really to blame. All appear to have been poisoned—and every death was accompanied by a mysterious note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for answers and dreading her own engagement to a wealthy gentleman, Allene returns to her passion for scientific discovery and recruits her long-lost friends, Jasper and Birdie, for help. The investigation brings her closer to Jasper, an apprentice medical examiner at Bellevue Hospital who still holds her heart, and offers the delicate Birdie a last-ditch chance to find a safe haven before her fragile health fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more of their friends and family die, alliances shift, lives become entangled, and the three begin to suspect everyone—even each other. As they race to find the culprit, Allene, Birdie, and Jasper must once again trust each other, before one of them becomes the next victim.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Someone once told me that you have two families in your life - the one you are born into and the one you choose. Yes, you may get to choose your partner, but you don't choose your mother-in-law. The cackling mercenaries of fate determine it all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Lucy met Diana, she was kept at arm's length. Diana is exquisitely polite, but Lucy knows, even after marrying Oliver, that they'll never have the closeness she'd been hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who could fault Diana? She was a pillar of the community, an advocate for social justice, the matriarch of a loving family. Lucy had wanted so much to please her new mother-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was ten years ago. Now, Diana has been found dead, leaving a suicide note. But the autopsy reveals evidence of suffocation. And everyone in the family is hiding something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Family Next Door&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; comes a new page-turner about that trickiest of relationships.</description>

  <description>“&lt;i&gt;Forget You Know Me&lt;/i&gt; is that book you can’t put down, and can’t stop thinking about when you are finished.” —&lt;b&gt;Sally Hepworth, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Family Next Door&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a video call between friends captures a shocking incident no one was supposed to see, the secrets it exposes threaten to change their lives forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly and Liza have always been enviably close. Even after Molly married Daniel, the couple considered Liza an honorary family member. But after Liza moved away, things grew more strained than anyone wanted to admit—in the friendship and the marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Daniel goes away on business, Molly and Liza plan to reconnect with a nice long video chat after the kids are in bed. But then Molly leaves the room to check on a crying child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Liza sees next will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing is certain: Molly needs her. Liza drives all night to be at Molly’s side—but when she arrives, the reception is icy, leaving Liza baffled and hurt. She knows there’s no denying what she saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In disbelief that their friendship could really be over, Liza is unaware she’s about to have a near miss of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Molly, refusing to deal with what’s happened, won’t turn to Daniel, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But none of them can go on pretending. Not after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Strawser's &lt;i&gt;Forget You Know Me&lt;/i&gt; is a “twisty, emotionally complex, powder keg of a tale” (bestselling author Emily Carpenter) about the wounds of people who’ve grown apart. Best, friends, separated by miles. Spouses, hardened by neglect. A mother, isolated by pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One moment will change things for them all.</description>

  <description>TARGET: HEAD OF STATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A leader has fallen, and the procession route from Capitol Hill to the White House is lined with hundreds of thousands of mourners. None feel the loss of a President more keenly than Alex Cross, who has devoted his life to the public good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TARGET: UNITED STATES CABINET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sniper’s bullet strikes a target in the heart of DC. Alex Cross’s wife, Bree Stone, newly elevated chief of DC detectives, faces an ultimatum: solve the case, or lose the position for which she’s worked her entire career. The Secret Service and the FBI deploy as well in the race to find the shooter. Alex is tasked by the new President to take a personal role with the FBI, leading an investigation unprecedented in scale and scope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TARGET: ALEX CROSS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex has a horrible premonition: is the sniper’s strike only the beginning of a larger attack on the nation? It isn’t long before his fears explode into life, and the nation plunges into a full-blown Constitutional crisis. His ingenuity, his training, and his capacity for battle are tested beyond limits in the most far-reaching and urgently consequential case of his life. As the rule of law is shattered by chaos, and Alex fights to isolate a suspect, Alex’s loyalty may be the biggest danger of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;October 1946, Clanton, Mississippi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pete Banning was Clanton, Mississippi's favorite son--a decorated World War II hero, the patriarch of a prominent family, a farmer, father, neighbor, and a faithful member of the Methodist church. Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, walked into the church, and calmly shot and killed his pastor and friend, the Reverend Dexter Bell. As if the murder weren't shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete's only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: "I have nothing to say." He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave.&lt;br /&gt; In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete's defense attorney tries desperately to save him. &lt;br /&gt; Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, &lt;i&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/i&gt; would not be complete without Grisham's signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the romantic tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nights in Rodanthe&lt;/i&gt;, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nicholas Sparks returns with a story about a chance encounter that becomes a touchstone for two vastly different individuals -- transcending decades, continents, and the bittersweet workings of fate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Anderson is at a crossroads. At thirty-six, she's been dating her boyfriend, an orthopedic surgeon, for six years. With no wedding plans in sight, and her father recently diagnosed with ALS, she decides to use a week at her family's cottage in Sunset Beach, North Carolina, to ready the house for sale and mull over some difficult decisions about her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tru Walls has never visited North Carolina but is summoned to Sunset Beach by a letter from a man claiming to be his father. A safari guide, born and raised in Zimbabwe, Tru hopes to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding his mother's early life and recapture memories lost with her death. When the two strangers cross paths, their connection is as electric as it is unfathomable . . . but in the immersive days that follow, their feelings for each other will give way to choices that pit family duty against personal happiness in devastating ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illuminating life's heartbreaking regrets and enduring hope, &lt;i&gt;Every Breath&lt;/i&gt; explores the many facets of love that lay claim to our deepest loyalties -- and asks the question, &lt;i&gt;How long can a dream survive?&lt;/i&gt;</description>
