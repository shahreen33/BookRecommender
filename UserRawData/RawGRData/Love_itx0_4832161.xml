  <description>Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist. After all, life isn't a scene from the movies, is it? But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie thinks she'll never see the boy from the bus again. But at their Christmas party a year later, her best friend Sarah introduces her to the new love of her life. Who is, of course, the boy from the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to let him go, Laurie gets on with her life. But what if fate has other plans?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following Laurie, Sarah and Jack through ten years of love, heartbreak and friendship, &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting, heart-warming and immensely moving love story that you'll want to escape into forever, for fans of Jojo Moyes, Lucy Diamond and Nicholas Sparks.</description>

  <description>Imagine you meet a man, spend six glorious days together, and fall in love. And it’s mutual: you’ve never been so certain of anything. &lt;p&gt;So when he leaves for a long-booked holiday and promises to call from the airport, you have no cause to doubt him.&lt;br /&gt;But he doesn’t call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your friends tell you to forget him, but you know they're wrong: something &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have happened; there &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be a reason for his silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you finally discover you're right? That there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a reason -- and that reason is the one thing you didn't share with each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The truth.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone makes mistakes. But does everyone deserve to be forgiven?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She runs past the tinkling of children’s laughter that fills the park. Heart hammering, she reaches the riverbank, breath catching in her throat as her eyes take in the small body, tangled in the reeds, pale and lifeless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three years later.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Claire’s life is picture perfect. A new home in the countryside. A new-born baby. A doting husband by her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But behind closed doors, her life is falling apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when a threatening note is posted through her letterbox, saying she doesn’t deserve her daughter, it’s clear that someone knows about her past… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone knows that Claire doesn’t deserve her perfect life. Someone’s going to do everything in their power to destroy it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An atmospheric, chilling and absolutely unputdownable psychological thriller about a mother’s worst nightmare. Fans of K.L. Slater, Shalini Boland and &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; will love the twists, turns and gasp-worthy shocks of this stunning debut from Ruth Heald.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Meet Zoe and Greg Milton, a married couple who have let themselves go a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe was a stunner in her college days, but the intervening decades have added five stone, and removed most of her self-esteem. Greg's rugby-playing days are well and truly behind him, thanks to countless pints of beer and chicken curry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elise, a radio DJ and Zoe's best friend, tells them about a new competition, it seems like the perfect opportunity to turn their lives around. Fat Chance will pit six hefty couples against one another to see who can collectively lose the most weight and walk away with a £50,000 prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins six months of abject misery, tears, and frustration--that just might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to them--in another laugh-out-loud look at the way we live now from bestselling author Nick Spalding.</description>

  <description>With her fortieth birthday approaching, Lucy Carpenter dares to hope that she finally has it all: a wonderful new husband, Jonah, a successful career and the chance of a precious baby of her own. Life couldn’t be more perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reality of becoming parents proves much harder than Lucy and Jonah imagined. Jonah’s love and support is unquestioning, but as Lucy struggles with work and her own failing dreams, the strain on their marriage increases. Suddenly it feels like Lucy is close to losing everything…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heart-wrenching and poignant, this latest work by bestselling author Amanda Prowse asks the question: what does it mean to be a mother in today’s hectic world? And what if it’s asking too much to want it all?</description>

  <description>Freya Braithwaite knows she is lucky. Nineteen years of marriage to a man who still warms her soul and two beautiful teenage daughters to show for it: confident Charlotte and thoughtful Lexi. Her home is filled with love and laughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Lexi’s struggles with weight take control of her life, everything Freya once took for granted falls apart, leaving the whole family with a sense of helplessness that can only be confronted with understanding, unity and, above all, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling and heart-wrenching new work by bestselling author Amanda Prowse, one ordinary family confronts unexpected difficulties and discovers that love can find its way through life’s darkest moments.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Finally we’re playing a game. A game that I have chosen. I give one last push of the roundabout and stand back. 'You really should have played with me,’ I tell her again although I know she can no longer hear.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Late one summer evening, &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; arrives at Haden Hill Park to the scene of a horrific crime: a woman in her sixties tied to a swing with barbed wire and an X carved into the back of her neck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The victim, Belinda Evans, was a retired college Professor of Child Psychology. As Kim and her team search her home, they find an overnight bag packed and begin to unravel a complex relationship between Belinda and her sister Veronica. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then two more bodies are found bearing the same distinctive markings, and Kim knows she is on the hunt for a ritualistic serial killer. Linking the victims, Kim discovers they were involved in annual tournaments for gifted children and were on their way to the next event. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With DS Penn immersed in the murder case of a young man, Kim and her team are already stretched and up against one of the most ruthless killer’s they’ve ever encountered. The clues lie in investigating every child who attended the tournaments, dating back decades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faced with hundreds of potential leads and a bereaved sister who is refusing to talk, can Kim get inside the mind of a killer and stop another murder before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The addictive new crime thriller from multi-million copy, number one bestseller Angela Marsons explores the dark side of child prodigies and will have you absolutely hooked.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers love the Detective Kim Stone series:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Marsons for me is the QUEEN of this genre&lt;/b&gt;. She knows how to add the human touch to each story and I just adore her. &lt;b&gt;Bloody FABULOUS&lt;/b&gt;.' &lt;i&gt;Postcard Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'&lt;b&gt;I absolutely loved it!&lt;/b&gt;...This one is &lt;b&gt;one of the best crime thrillers I've read in a long time&lt;/b&gt;, and that includes mainstream authors such as James Patterson! I would seriously put this book in the same league.' &lt;i&gt;Fiona’s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘The &lt;b&gt;uber-sharp Kim Stone has to be one of the best detectives out there&lt;/b&gt;. A &lt;b&gt;twisty, fast-paced&lt;/b&gt; plot stocked with red herrings.’ &lt;i&gt;Bookpreneur&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘The author writes to such a consistently high level. Yet again, &lt;b&gt;gripping plot line, strong characters and a well-paced story that builds to a crescendo&lt;/b&gt;. If you haven't already tried this author &lt;b&gt;do yourself a favour and start reading now&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Worcester Source&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'I blooming love this series.&lt;/b&gt; I &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; Kim, her vulnerability and tenacity, I &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; the interaction and banter between the characters…. &lt;b&gt;another cracking addition to an already brilliant and well established series&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Angela Marsons is fast becoming one of the best crime fiction authors going.'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Laughing Librarian&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;DI Kim Stone is the most fascinating character to arrive on the scene since Val McDermid gave us Tony Hill&lt;/b&gt;.'

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘I’m your husband, Chloe. We’re a partnership now and we do what’s best for us as a couple. Staying here is going to be the best option.’ He picked up his drink and took a sip. ‘It’s not open for discussion. We’re not going home.’ &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chloe had the dream wedding. Dan is her perfect man. They haven’t known each other for long, but as she walked down the aisle and saw him standing by the altar, tears glistening in his eyes, she knew this was forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Later, as they relax on a beautiful island, settling in to their new married life together, they congratulate themselves on their lovely wedding day, and Dan jokes that he’d like them to stay there forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as the honeymoon goes on, he becomes increasingly adamant. They shouldn’t leave. In fact, he won’t let her… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An utterly gripping psychological thriller for fans of Gillian Flynn, Clare Mackintosh, and &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Nadia gets the 7.30 train every morning without fail. Well, except if she oversleeps or wakes up at her friend Emma’s after too much wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get the 7.30 train every morning, which is easy because he hasn’t been able to sleep properly since his dad died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, Nadia’s eye catches sight of a post in the daily paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;To the cute girl with the coffee stains on her dress. I’m the guy who’s always standing near the doors… Drink sometime?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins a not-quite-romance of near-misses, true love, and the power of the written word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. In this deft exploration of love, loyalty, race, justice, and both Black masculinity and Black womanhood in 21st century America, Jones achieves that most-illusive of all literary goals: the Great American Novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;From the author of the bestselling debut novel of 2015 &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luckiest Girl Alive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; comes Jessica Knoll's new thriller, featuring a pair of competitive and uber-successful sisters whose secrets and lies result in murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When five hyper-successful, beautiful, and hugely competitive women agree to appear on a new TV show set in New York City called "Goal Diggers", executives expect a season filled with the petty grievances, vicious social media attacks, and outrageous posturing that makes these shows catnip to the viewing public. But they can't anticipate the second season of "Goal Diggers" will feature murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured as a series of episodes, Jessica Knoll's second novel again delivers a deliciously scathing expose and the same hair-raising plot twists readers loved in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luckiest Girl Alive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;l Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt; is the brilliant tale of two stories. One is about Aimee Sinclair—well-known actress on the verge of being full-on famous. If you saw her, you’d think you knew her. One day towards the near-end of her shoot on her latest film, Aimee comes home from filming to find her husband’s cell phone and wallet on the dining room table. He never goes anywhere without them. But he’s nowhere to be found. She’s not too concerned—they had a huge fight the night before. They both said things they didn’t mean. He might have done things he didn’t mean, things she can’t forget. Even though she has a history of supposedly forgetting. After all, she’s a very good actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning she goes for her morning run and then goes to her favorite coffee shop. But her card is denied. When she calls the bank they say her account has been emptied of $10,000. She immediately suspects her husband. But they say no, it was Aimee herself who closed out the account. And thus begins a bizarre rabbit hole into which Aimee finds herself falling where nothing is at it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating with Aimee’s story is that of a little girl who wandered away from home. We always tell our kids not to talk to strangers or bad things will happen. Well, bad things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;I Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt;, Alice Feeney proves that she is a master at brilliantly complicated plots and twists after twists.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;May Rosevere has reached the grand old age of one-hundred-and-ten, thanks to a slice of toast with butter every morning, a glass (or two) of sherry in the evening, and the wonders of the Cornish sea breeze – or so she tells everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But May has a secret. One that no one has ever discovered, not even her late husband Charles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A treasure trove of long-forgotten letters, just waiting to reveal their secrets, and frosty neighbour Julia are changing everything…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tiffy Moore and Leon Twomey each have a problem and need a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy’s been dumped by her cheating boyfriend and urgently needs a new flat. But earning minimum wage at a quirky publishing house means that her choices are limited in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon, a palliative care nurse, is more concerned with other people’s welfare than his own. Along with working night shifts looking after the terminally ill, his sole focus is on raising money to fight his brother’s unfair imprisonment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon has a flat that he only uses 9 to 5. Tiffy works 9 to 5 and needs a place to sleep. The solution to their problems? To share a bed of course...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Leon and Tiffy’s unusual arrangement becomes a reality, they start to connect through Post-It notes left for each other around the flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can true love blossom even in the unlikeliest of situations?&lt;br /&gt;Can true love blossom even if you never see one another?&lt;br /&gt;Or does true love blossom when you are least expecting it?</description>

  <description>A serial killer is burning people alive in the Lake District's prehistoric stone circles. He leaves no clues and the police are helpless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his name is found carved into the charred remains of the third victim, disgraced detective Washington Poe is brought back from suspension and into an investigation he wants no part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reluctantly partnered with the brilliant but socially awkward civilian analyst, Tilly Bradshaw, the mismatched pair uncover a trail that only he is meant to see. The elusive killer has a plan and for some reason Poe is part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises, Poe discovers he has far more invested in the case than he could have possibly imagined. And in a shocking finale that will shatter everything he's ever believed about himself, Poe will learn that there are things far worse than being burned alive...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are things I need to know...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a farm in southern Ireland, the dismembered bones of eleven women are found in a common grave, buried eight decades ago. Detective Superintendent Katie Maguire is used to bloodshed, but this ivory litter of human remains is unimaginable butchery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of other worlds apart from this...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In isolated darkness not far away, an American tourist is at the mercy of a serial killer. His tools are a boning knife, twine, and a doll fashioned from nails and fishhooks. The murder of his victims is second only to the pleasure of their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darker places inhabited by evil monstrosities...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As an eighty-year-old mystery unfolds, so does a modern-day ritual that's marked Katie Maguire as its next victim. For what happened once in this small picturesque village is happening again. It's more than a series of horrifying crimes. It's tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take me there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Insidious Intent&lt;/i&gt;, Tony and Carol are on the hunt for a serial killer who victimizes women at weddings without a date--and forces the duo to confront their most haunting moral dilemma so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the north of England, single women are beginning to disappear from weddings. A pattern soon becomes clear: Someone is crashing the festivities and luring the women away--only to leave the victims' bodies in their own burned-out cars in remote locations. Tony and Carol are called upon to investigate--but this may be the toughest case they've ever had to face. Meanwhile, Detective Sergeant Paula McIntyre and her partner Elinor must deal with a cruel cyber-blackmailer targeting their teenage ward, Torin.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Splinter the Silence&lt;/i&gt; is a novel centered on the mysterious deaths of several women who were the victims of vicious cyberbullying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it violence if it’s virtual? The outspoken women targeted by the increasingly cruel internet trolls and bullies would probably say so. For some of them, the torrents of bile and vicious threats prove too much. They begin to silence themselves in a series of high-profile suicides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or do they? Tony Hill isn’t convinced. But he’s the only one. Former cop Carol Jordan is too busy messing up her life to care. Until she gets an unexpected second chance. Now it’s game on, and the stakes have never been higher.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Guilt and grief have driven a wedge between long time crime-fighting partners psychologist Tony Hill and ex-DCI Carol Jordan. But just because they’re not talking doesn’t mean the killing stops.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is killing women. Women who bear an unsettling resemblance to Carol Jordan. And when the evidence begins to point in a disturbing direction, thinking the unthinkable seems the only possible answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cornered by events, Tony and Carol are forced to fight for themselves and each other as never before.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sophie Mayhew &lt;/b&gt;looks like she has the perfect life. Wife of rising political star John F Mayhew, a man who is one step away from the top job in the government, her glamour matches his looks, power, breeding and money. But John has made some stupid mistakes along the way, some of which are threatening to emerge. Still, all this can still be swept under the carpet as long as Sophie 'the trophy' plays her part in front of the cameras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the words that come out of Sophie’s mouth one morning on the doorstep of their country house are not the words the spin doctors put in there.  Bursting out of the restrictive mould she has been in since birth, Sophie flees to a place that was special to her as a child, a small village on the coast where she intends to be alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But once there, she finds she becomes part of a community that warms her soul and makes her feel as if she is breathing properly for the first time. Sophie knows she won't be left in peace for long. Now she must decide: where does her real future lie? </description>

  <description>Clinical psychologist Tony Hill has had a good run. He and police detective Carol Jordan have put away scores of dangerous criminals and have a clearance rate that colleagues envy or resent. But there is one serial killer who has shaped and defined their careers, a person whose evil surpasses all others: Jacko Vance, an ex-celebrity and sociopath whose brilliance and utter lack of remorse have never left Tony’s mind in the ten years Vance has been locked up. Now Jacko has broken out of prison and, with a mind even more twisted and cunning than before, he is focused on wreaking revenge on Tony and Carol for the years he has spent in prison. They don’t know when Jacko will strike, or where. All they know is that he will cause them to feel fear like they’ve never known.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She ruined their lives. Now they’re going to destroy hers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Someone is recreating every traumatic point in your life. They are doing this to make you suffer, to make you hurt and the only possible end game can be death. Your death.’&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the fourth floor of Chaucer House, two teenagers are found chained to a radiator. The boy is dead but the girl is alive. For &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; every detail of the scene mirrors her own terrifying experience with her brother Mikey, when they lived in the same tower block thirty years ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the bodies of a middle-aged couple are discovered in a burnt-out car, Kim can’t ignore the chilling similarity to the deaths of Erica and Keith – the only loving parents Kim had ever known. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faced with a killer who is recreating traumatic events from her past, Kim must face the brutal truth that someone wants to hurt her in the worst way possible. Desperate to stay on the case, she is forced to work with profiler Alison Lowe who has been called in to observe and monitor Kim’s behaviour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kim has spent years catching dangerous criminals and protecting the innocent. But with a killer firmly fixed on destroying Kim, can she solve this complex case and save her own life or will she become the final victim?</description>

  <description>The residents of Bradfield are devastated when their star midfielder dies, the victim of a bizarre, seemingly motiveless murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a hospital, recovering from injuries, criminal profiler and psychologist Dr. Tony Hill struggles to make sense of the fragments of information he can gather in order to help his ally, Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan, bring a killer to justice. Then an explosion rips through a soccer stadium, leaving dozens dead and many more injured, and Jordan finds herself pushed to the margins of the investigation by the intelligence services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the dark places in their relationship, Tony and Carol remain the best hope for uncovering the truth about an ever-increasing series of unspeakable crimes. Are they terrorist attacks, a personal vendetta . . . or something even more sinister?</description>

  <description>Nach dem brutalen Scheitern eines Undercover-Einsatzes in Berlin wird die Sonderermittlerin Carol Jordan von ihrem alten Chef in das nordenglische Bradfield zurückgerufen, um wieder ihre frühere Stelle als Detective Chief Inspector anzutreten. Carol leidet noch immer an den Folgen dieses Einsatzes, zudem stößt sie bei ihren Kollegen auf starke Vorbehalte, was ihre psychische Stabilität und ihre Führungsqualitäten betrifft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geplagt von Selbstzweifeln und ihren bösen Erinnerungen fällt es Carol schwer, sich in ihrer gewohnten Umgebung einzuleben. Zwar ist auch ihr Freund und ehemaliger Geliebter, der Psychologe Tony Hill, nach Bradford zurückgekehrt, um sich in einer psychiatrischen Haftanstalt neuen Aufgaben zu widmen, doch ihre Annäherung wird nach wie vor von den Vorfällen in Berlin überschattet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zu allem Überfluss tun sich schon mit den ersten beiden Fällen, deren Leitung Carol übernimmt, erneut menschliche Abgründe auf, die sie vor eine schwere Belastungsprobe stellen. Im ersten Fall deuten die Umstände des Verschwindens eines kleinen Jungen bald auf die Machenschaften von Pädophilen und Kinderschändern hin. Doch weit folgenreicher soll sich die Jagd nach einem Prostituiertenmörder erweisen: Hier sieht sich Carol trotz ihrer eigenen bösen Erfahrungen gezwungen, eine junge Kollegin in einen gefährlichen Undercover-Einsatz zu schicken ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mit &lt;i&gt;Tödliche Worte&lt;/i&gt; knüpft Val McDermid fast nahtlos an ihren harten Psychothriller &lt;i&gt;Ein kalter Strom&lt;/i&gt; an. Und wiederum bleibt sie sich selbst treu und inszeniert mit dem vierten Fall um ihr Ermittlerduo Tony Hill und Carol Jordan buchstäblich ein Schrecken ohne Ende. Der über 500 Seiten starke Thriller ist deshalb auch nichts für zart besaitete Gemüter, denn McDermids Grundthema dieser Serie bleibt die Pathologie des Bösen mit der alptraumhaften Psychologie und den Innenansichten von Serienmördern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doch wo sich die schottische Autorin mit eigenständigen und exzellenten Romanen wie &lt;i&gt;Echo einer Winternacht&lt;/i&gt; auf bemerkenswerte Weise erzählerisches Terrain erobert hat, wiederholen sich in &lt;i&gt;Tödliche Worte&lt;/i&gt; die Erzählmuster ihrer vorangegangenen Serienromane auf zu offensichtliche Weise. So wirkt der Plot mit seinen Perspektivwechseln hier fast nur noch reißerisch. Gleichzeitig mangelt es der Handlung stellenweise an Logik, was hier z. B. ganz deutlich an den unglaubwürdigen Abläufen der polizeilichen Ermittlungsarbeit zu erkennen ist. Insgesamt hinterlässt der Roman einen recht zwiespältigen Eindruck: Spannend erzählen kann Val McDermid allemal, deshalb wäre es sehr schade, wenn sie uns nichts Neues mehr zu erzählen hätte. &lt;i&gt;--Christian Koch&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Mapping the minds of murderers is what Dr. Tony Hill does better than anyone. So when a twisted killer starts targeting psychologists across Northern Europe, Hill is the obvious choice to track the executioner's mental and physical journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that Tony, still bearing the scars of past cases, doesn't want to do this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the killer is about to strike uncomfortably close to home. The next victim is a friend and colleague. And Tony's former partner, Detective Carol Jordan, is directly in the murderer's path, working undercover in a world where human life means less than the smallest drug deal. She needs Tony's help as much as the beleaguered European police officials do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the danger is closing in. Confronting the worst of modern crime and struggling to unravel roots that lie deep in the tormented past of Nazi atrocities and Stasi abuses, Tony and Carol are forced to battle for survival against overwhelming odds. In this morass of double-cross and double-dealing, they have no one to trust but each other. Deftly merging the dark terrain of forensic psychology with the brooding, crime-streaked world of post-Cold War Europe, McDermid's latest is an unrivaled tour de force that takes Tony Hill further into the mind of a killer than he's ever dared to go before.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No sleep for twenty hours. No food for ten. And a ward full of soon-to-be mothers… Welcome to the life of a midwife. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life on the NHS front line, working within a system at breaking point, is more extreme than you could ever imagine. From the bloody to the beautiful, from moments of utter vulnerability to remarkable displays of strength, from camaraderie to raw desperation, from heart-wrenching grief to the pure, perfect joy of a new-born baby, midwife Leah Hazard has seen it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through her eyes, we meet &lt;b&gt;Eleanor&lt;/b&gt;, whose wife is a walking miracle of modern medicine, their baby a feat of reproductive science; &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt;, pregnant at just fifteen, the precarious, flickering life within her threatening to come far too soon; &lt;b&gt;Star&lt;/b&gt;, birthing in a room heady with essential oils and love until an enemy intrudes and &lt;b&gt;Pei Hsuan&lt;/b&gt;, who has carried her tale of exploitation and endurance thousands of miles to somehow find herself at the open door of Leah’s ward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving, compassionate and intensely candid, &lt;i&gt;Hard Pushed &lt;/i&gt;is a love letter to new mothers and to Leah’s fellow midwives – there for us at some of the most challenging, empowering and defining moments of our lives.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Your best friend stole your fiancé. Do you run away and hide, or start planning your revenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy thought she knew everything there was to know about her best friend Melissa. Then again, Amy also thought she was on the verge of the wedding of her dreams to her long-distance fiancé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she pays a surprise trip home to London. Jack is out, but it's clear another woman has been making herself at home in their flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's something about her stuff that feels oddly familiar . . . and then it hits Amy. The Other Woman is Melissa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy has lost her home, her fiancé and her best friend in one disastrous weekend - but instead of falling apart, she's determined to get her own back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piecing her life back together won't be half as fun as dismantling theirs, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TOP 5 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A deftly plotted, witty tale of revenge.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wished for a different mother? Dido has...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dido Sylvia Jones is six years and twenty-seven days old when she moves from London squat to suburban Essex and promptly falls in love with Tom Trevelyan, the boy next door. It's not just Tom that Dido falls for, though: it's also his precocious sister, Harry, and their fastidious, controlling mother, Angela. Because Angela is everything that Edie—Dido's own mother—is not. And the Trevelyans are exactly the kind of family Dido dreams of: Normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dido wants to be normal more than anything else in the world. But it's the very thing that Edie can never be, as Dido—and the Trevelyans, including Dido's beloved Tom—will eventually learn the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the very best families, Joanna Nadin's &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Bloody Everything&lt;/i&gt; is funny, warm, tender and heartbreaking in equal measure. Part love story, it's ultimately about mothers and daughters: about realizing, however long it takes, that family might be what you make it, but you can't change where you come from.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;**The million copy bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Faking Friends&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;My Sweet Revenge&lt;/i&gt; is back - pre-order now!**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly and Roz spend most of their days together. They like the same jokes, loathe the same people and tell each other everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when single mum Holly gets a shot at her dream job after putting everything on hold to raise her daughter, she assumes her friend will be dying to pop the champagne with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is she just imagining things, or is Roz not quite as happy for her as she should be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Holly starts to take a closer look at Roz's life outside their friendship, she begins to discover a few things that don't add up. Who is the woman who claims to be her ally? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it was a mistake to tell Roz all her secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it takes two to forge a friendship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it only takes one to wage a war . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Jane Fallon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Original, compulsively readable' &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Hugely compelling and unpredictable' &lt;i&gt;Ruth Jones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Deliciously devious' &lt;i&gt;Daily Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'She's in a category all of her own' Marian Keyes</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘An engrossing, irresistible story about the coming to light of a long-buried secret. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a paragraph in an evening newspaper reveals a decades-old tragedy, most readers barely give it a glance. But for three strangers it’s impossible to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one woman, it’s a reminder of the worst thing that ever happened to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For another, it reveals the dangerous possibility that her darkest secret is about to be discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the third, a journalist, it’s the first clue in a hunt to uncover the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Child’s story will be told.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Marianne Power was stuck in a rut. Then one day she wondered: could self-help books help her find the elusive perfect life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She decided to test one book a month for a year, following their advice to the letter. What would happen if she followed the &lt;i&gt;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/i&gt;? Really felt &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt;? Could she unearth &lt;i&gt;The Secret&lt;/i&gt; to making her dreams come true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What begins as a clever experiment becomes an achingly poignant story. Because self-help can change your life – but not necessarily for the better . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Help Me!&lt;/i&gt; is an irresistibly funny and incredibly moving book about a wild and ultimately redemptive journey that will resonate with anyone who’s ever dreamed of finding happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On a stifling summer's day, eleven-year-old Jack and his two sisters sit in their broken-down car, waiting for their mother to come back and rescue them. &lt;i&gt;Jack's in charge&lt;/i&gt;, she said. &lt;i&gt;I won't be long.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she doesn't come back. She never comes back. And life as the children know it is changed for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, mum-to-be Catherine wakes to find a knife beside her bed, and a note that says: &lt;i&gt;I could have killed you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Jack is still in charge - of his sisters, of supporting them all, of making sure nobody knows they're alone in the house, and - quite suddenly - of finding out the truth about what happened to his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the truth can be a dangerous thing ...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Yesterday, Scott was dead.&lt;br /&gt;Today, he’s back.&lt;br /&gt;And Anna doesn’t believe in ghosts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years ago Scott was Anna’s boyfriend. She loved him, but he ruined her life. When he died, she should have been free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today Scott is on the radio, talking about her. Threatening to spill her secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna is a mother, a wife, and head teacher of a primary school. And she’s a very good liar. She has been lying about herself for so long, she doesn’t really know who she is any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna used to think she was a good person. She made one stupid mistake, and now she is having to pay for it – over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott is the only person who knows the truth about her past. But how can Scott be alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, DCI Tom Douglas is going to knock on her door looking for answers. But Anna is already running scared: from the man she used to love; the man she watched die all those years ago; the man who has come back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She has one week to find him. One week to stop him.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Across the country, dozens of teenage girls have vanished. Authorities are convinced they're runaways with just the bad luck of the draw to connect them. It's the job of criminal profilers Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan to look for a pattern. They've spent years exploring the psyches of madmen. But sane men kill, too. And when they hide in plain sight, they can be difficult to find...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's handsome and talented, rich and famous--a notorious charmer with the power to seduce...and the will to destroy. No one can believe what he's capable of. No one can imagine what he's already done. And no one can fathom what he's about to do next. Until one of Hill's students is murdered--the first move in a sick and violent game for three players. Now, of all the killers Hill and Jordan have hunted, none has been so ruthless, so terrifyingly clever, and so brilliantly elusive as the killer who's hunting them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val McDermid's &lt;i&gt;Wire in the Blood &lt;/i&gt;is "A superb psychological thriller" (Cosmopolitan).</description>

  <description>In her unmissable debut, actress and screenwriter Ruth Jones shows us the dangers of trying to recapture that which was once lost and failing to realise the beauty of what we already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;We spend most of our lives wishing we were somewhere else or someone else, or looking forward or harping back. Always thinking the grass is greener on the other side. But it never is. It’s still grass. Just a different patch of it, that’s all.&lt;/i&gt;’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The past has a habit of tracking us down. And tripping us up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kate was twenty-two, she had an intense and passionate affair with a married man, Callum, which ended in heartbreak. Kate thought she’d never get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen years later, life has moved on – Kate, now a successful actress, is living in London, married to Matt and mother to little Tallulah. Meanwhile Callum and his wife Belinda are happy together, living in Edinburgh and watching their kids grow up. The past, it would seem, is well and truly behind them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Kate meets Callum again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are faced with a choice: to walk away from each other . . . or to risk finding out what might have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second chances are a rare gift in life. But that doesn’t mean they should always be taken . . .&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Big Girl Panties&lt;/em&gt; by Stephanie Evanovich is a rollicking and poignant romantic comedy about a young widow who decides to get in shape...and winds up getting her groove back—and a whole lot more!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly Brennan used food to comfort herself through her husband’s illness and death. Now she’s alone at age thirty-two. And she weighs more than she ever has. When fate throws her in the path of Logan Montgomery, personal trainer to pro athletes, and he offers to train her, Holly concludes it must be a sign. Much as she dreads the thought of working out, Holly knows she needs to put on her big girl panties and see if she can sweat out some of her grief.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon, the easy intimacy and playful banter of their training sessions lead Logan and Holly to most intense and steamy workouts. But can Holly and Logan go the distance as a couple now that she’s met her goals—and other men are noticing?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE MOST PERFECT CHRISTMAS FEEL-GOOD READ!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Every time you discover a new Milly book, it’s like finding a pot of gold'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Heat&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eve Glace&lt;/b&gt; - co-owner of the theme park Winterworld - is having a baby and her due date is a perfectly timed 25th December. And she’s decided that she and her husband &lt;b&gt;Jacques &lt;/b&gt;should renew their wedding vows with all the pomp that was missing the first time.  But growing problems at Winterworld keep distracting them … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annie Pandoro&lt;/b&gt; and her husband &lt;b&gt;Joe&lt;/b&gt; own a small Christmas cracker factory, are well set up and happy together despite life never blessing them with a much-wanted child.  But when Annie finds that the changes happening to her body aren’t typical of the menopause but pregnancy, her joy is uncontainable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palma Collins&lt;/b&gt; has agreed to act as a surrogate, hoping the money will get her out of the gutter in which she finds herself.  But when the couple she is helping split up, is she going to be left carrying a baby she never intended to keep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Annie, Palma and Eve all meet at the ‘Christmas Pudding Club’, a new directive started by a forward-thinking young doctor to help mums-to-be mingle and share their pregnancy journeys. Will this group help each other to find love, contentment and peace as Christmas approaches?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brand new novel from the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Perfectly Imperfect Woman;&lt;/i&gt; a gorgeous read full of love, life, laughter - and crackers! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eeeny meeny, miney, moe. Who lives, who dies only I know.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the body of a doctor is discovered brutally murdered in local woodland, &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; is shocked to discover the victim is Gordon Cordell – a man linked to a previous case she worked on involving the death of a young school girl. Gordon has a chequered past, but who would want him dead? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the investigation gets underway, Gordon’s son is involved in a horrific car crash which leaves him fighting for his life. Kim's sure this was no accident. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the body of a woman is found dead in suspicious circumstances and Kim makes a disturbing link between the victims and Russells Hall Hospital. The same hospital where Gordon worked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Kim and her team still grieving the loss of one of their own, they’re at their weakest and facing one of the most dangerous serial killers they’ve ever encountered. Everything is on the line. Can Kim keep her squad together and find the killer before he claims his next victim? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The killer is picking off his victims at a terrifying pace, and he’s not finished yet. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Beloved #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Colleen Hoover returns with an unforgettable love story between a writer and his unexpected muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallon meets Ben, an aspiring novelist, the day before her scheduled cross-country move. Their untimely attraction leads them to spend Fallon’s last day in L.A. together, and her eventful life becomes the creative inspiration Ben has always sought for his novel. Over time and amidst the various relationships and tribulations of their own separate lives, they continue to meet on the same date every year. Until one day Fallon becomes unsure if Ben has been telling her the truth or fabricating a perfect reality for the sake of the ultimate plot twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Ben’s relationship with Fallon—and simultaneously his novel—be considered a love story if it ends in heartbreak?</description>

  <description>11 hours, 11 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;WHO WILL BELIEVE YOUR STORY IF THE ONLY WITNESS IS DEAD?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleo knows she should be happy for her brother Mark. He's managed to find someone new after the sudden death of his first wife - but something about Evie just doesn't feel right...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Evie starts having accidents at home, her friends grow concerned. Could Mark be causing her injuries? Called out to their cliff-top house one night, Sergeant Stephanie King finds two bodies entangled on blood-drenched sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does murder begin? When the knife is raised to strike, or before, at the first thought of violence? As the accused stands trial, the jury is forced to consider - is there ever a proper defence for murder? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>When Frankie stumbles upon an unopened letter from her late mother, she’s delighted to have one last message from her . . . until she reads the contents and discovers the truth about her birth. Brimming with questions, she travels to York to seek further answers from the Mortimer family, but her appearance sends shockwaves through them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Robyn Mortimer has problems of her own. Her husband John has become distant, and a chance remark from a friend leads Robyn to wonder exactly what he’s not been saying. Dare she find out more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Bunny, she fell head over heels in love with Dave Mortimer when she first arrived in town, but now it seems her past is catching up with her. She can’t help wondering if he’ll still feel the same way about her if he discovers who she really is – and what she did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets tumble out and loyalties are tested, the Mortimers have to face up to some difficult decisions. With love, betrayal and dramatic revelations in the mix, this is one summer they’ll never forget.</description>

  <description>The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center—a women’s reproductive health services clinic—its staff offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester disguised as a patient, who now stands in the cross hairs of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed individual himself, vowing to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the same place on this fateful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Picoult—one of the most fearless writers of our time—tackles a complicated issue in this gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to be a good parent? &lt;i&gt;A Spark of Light&lt;/i&gt; will inspire debate, conversation . . . and, hopefully, understanding.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What lengths would you go to if you thought a killer was innocent?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the walls of the high-security psychiatric facility, Crowmont Hospital, reside many violent offenders. To nurse Leah Smith, no matter what, all offenders are patients first and foremost. When Leah is appointed as nurse to Isabel Fielding, she is determined to remain professional despite the &lt;b&gt;shocking crime&lt;/b&gt; Isabel allegedly committed in her past.&lt;br /&gt;Seven years ago, six-year-old Maisie Earnshaw was found face down in a duck pond, her body mutilated. Isabel--at age fourteen, found covered in Maisie's blood--was convicted of &lt;b&gt;murder&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;As Leah spends time with Isabel, she comes to know her as a young woman with a sweet, gentle nature, someone she could never see as a murderer. Leah begins to suspect members of the Fielding family of framing Isabel as a young girl, and she's not the only one. True crime blogger James Gorden thinks Isabel is &lt;b&gt;innocent&lt;/b&gt; too.&lt;br /&gt;But is Leah letting her own troubled past taint her judgement as she grows closer to her patient? &lt;b&gt;Or has a young woman been unjustly robbed of her childhood?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chilling psychological thriller by the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Silent Child&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Suspenseful and terrifying, I was literally reading through my fingers at some points. If you want an unputdownable book that will give you chills, look no further." &lt;b&gt;- Shalini Boland, author of &lt;i&gt;The Secret Mother&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She took a mouthful of the sweet liquid and started to feel a pounding in her head. Arms went around her waist and she was half lifted and half pulled.

      <![CDATA[Good second instalment in the DI Prince series. Very touchy subject re the crimes committed but I think it was done well. Kept me on the edge of my seat and had the right amount of Rachel’s personal life in it as well as the crimes being committed.]]>

And Rachel must decide what is more important – catching the killer or keeping her own secrets? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A breath-taking, tense roller-coaster crime thriller featuring unforgettable series detective Rachel Prince. &lt;i&gt;Now She’s Gone&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of Angela Marsons, Peter James and Karin Slaughter.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about the Detective Rachel Prince series:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I was &lt;b&gt;hooked from page one and couldn’t put it down&lt;/b&gt; until I’d reached the end. &lt;b&gt;The twists and turns just keep coming…&lt;/b&gt; will have you gasping in surprise.’ &lt;i&gt;Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I held my breath all the way through, wanting, yet not wanting to know the outcome.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far would you go to protect your darkest secrets?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When teenager &lt;b&gt;Sadie Winter&lt;/b&gt; jumps from the roof of her school, her death is ruled as suicide – a final devastating act from a troubled girl. But then the broken body of a young boy is discovered at the same school and it’s clear to &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; that these deaths are not tragic accidents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Kim and her team begin to unravel a dark web of secrets, one of the teachers could hold the key to the truth. Yet just as she is about to break her silence, she is found dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With more children’s lives at risk, Kim has to consider the unthinkable - whether a fellow pupil could be responsible for the murders. Investigating the psychology of children that kill brings the detective into contact with her former adversary, &lt;b&gt;Dr Alex Thorne&lt;/b&gt; – the sociopath who has made it her life’s work to destroy Kim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to catch the killer, Kim finds a link between the recent murders and an initiation prank that happened at the school decades earlier. But saving these innocent lives comes at a cost – and one of Kim’s own might pay the ultimate price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The astonishing new novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jodi Picoult about a family torn apart by an accusation of murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;They tell me I'm lucky to have a son who's so verbal, who is blisteringly intelligent, who can take apart the broken microwave and have it working again an hour later. They think there is no greater hell than having a son who is locked in his own world, unaware that there's a wider one to explore. But try having a son who is locked in his own world, and still wants to make a connection. A son who tries to be like everyone else, but truly doesn't know how.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jacob Hunt is a teenage boy with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject--in his case, forensic analysis. He's always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to do...and he's usually right. But then his town is rocked by a terrible murder and, for a change, the police come to Jacob with questions. All of the hallmark behaviors of Asperger's--not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, flat affect--can look a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel. Suddenly, Jacob and his family, who only want to fit in, feel the spotlight shining directly on them. For his mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication of why nothing is normal because of Jacob. And over this small family the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emotionally powerful from beginning to end, House Rules looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way--and fails those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far would you go to protect your darkest secrets?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When teenager &lt;b&gt;Sadie Winter&lt;/b&gt; jumps from the roof of her school, her death is ruled as suicide – a final devastating act from a troubled girl. But then the broken body of a young boy is discovered at the same school and it’s clear to &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; that these deaths are not tragic accidents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Kim and her team begin to unravel a dark web of secrets, one of the teachers could hold the key to the truth. Yet just as she is about to break her silence, she is found dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With more children’s lives at risk, Kim has to consider the unthinkable - whether a fellow pupil could be responsible for the murders. Investigating the psychology of children that kill brings the detective into contact with her former adversary, &lt;b&gt;Dr Alex Thorne&lt;/b&gt; – the sociopath who has made it her life’s work to destroy Kim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to catch the killer, Kim finds a link between the recent murders and an initiation prank that happened at the school decades earlier. But saving these innocent lives comes at a cost – and one of Kim’s own might pay the ultimate price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;To commit the perfect murder, you need the perfect cover.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold icy morning, a mother wakes to find her daughter's blood-soaked body frozen to the road. Who would carry out such a horrific killing on the victim's doorstep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight off her last harrowing case, &lt;b&gt;Detective Erika Foster&lt;/b&gt; is feeling fragile but determined to lead the investigation. As she sets to work, she finds reports of assaults in the same quiet South London suburb where the woman was killed. One chilling detail links them to the murder victim - they were all attacked by a figure in black wearing a gas mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erika is on the hunt for a killer with a terrifying calling card. The case gets more complicated when she uncovers a tangled web of secrets surrounding the death of the beautiful young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet just as Erika begins to piece the clues together, she is forced to confront painful memories of her past.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wondered what secrets other mothers are keeping? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenny has too much on her plate:&lt;/b&gt; literally – she’s only pregnant with one child but she’s already eating for three. Not to mention trying to &lt;b&gt;juggle her future life with a baby, a nightmare boss, a know-it-all sister, and a bizarrely laid back husband. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She used to be famous for her ‘Single Girl About Town’ journalism. But not only is she bored of parties, she also hasn’t been single for years, and is now 8½ months pregnant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when her boss hands her column to a younger colleague, &lt;b&gt;Jenny panics and proposes instead writing about being a clueless new mum.&lt;/b&gt; Surely people will find her new friendship group fascinating? Even if the only thing they have in common is that they all had sex around the same time 9 months ago... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like – what’s the deal with scary Gail’s mystery husband? How is posh mum Antonia already out drinking when Jenny can barely make a cup of tea? Why isn’t sweet-natured Ruth answering any phone calls? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if her readers aren’t quite hooked yet, &lt;b&gt;maybe Jenny will just have to be more liberal with the truth. After all, none of the other mums will read it… will they? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Undercover Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a feel-good parenting page turner that will make you laugh, cry and recognise every moment. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Why Mummy Drinks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Bad Mother’s Diary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They will be coming soon. They come every night. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Snow is falling softly as a young woman takes her last breath. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Fifteen miles away, two women sit silently in a dark kitchen. They don’t speak, because there is nothing left to be said. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Another woman boards a plane to escape the man who is trying to steal her life. But she will have to return, sooner or later. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;These strangers have one thing in common. They each made one bad choice - and now they have no choices left. Soon they won’t be strangers, they’ll be family… &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When DCI Tom Douglas is called to the cold, lonely scene of a suspicious death, he is baffled. Who is she? Where did she come from? How did she get there? &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;How many more must die? Who is controlling them, and how can they be stopped?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There’s blossom in the trees and daffodils as far as the eye can see. Maddie is looking forward to a fresh start in the countryside, but there’s just one little problem…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Following a scandal at her high-flying PR agency, twenty-six-year-old &lt;b&gt;Maddie&lt;/b&gt; flees London to help promote what she thinks is going to be a luxurious holiday retreat in the countryside. Everything is riding on her making a success of this new job… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet when she arrives, Maddie is horrified to find a rundown old farm in a terrible state. The brooding and secretive owner, &lt;b&gt;Seth&lt;/b&gt;, spent all his money on leasing the land when he fell in love with the beautiful, dishevelled farm cottages and the very romantic story behind them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Maddie discovers an old painting by the original owner’s wife, she unlocks the secret of the farm’s history and quickly realises she must start getting her hands dirty if this very special place is going to have any chance of survival. As she and Seth begin working together, the stunning view from the top of the hill is not the only thing that’s leaving her breathless… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After weeks of hard work the dream looks like it might become a reality, until a secret from Maddie’s past threatens to snatch it all away again. &lt;b&gt;Can Maddie find a way to save the business and herself? Will she finally find a place to keep her heart within the crumbling walls of the little cottage on the hill?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jenny Colgan, Lucy Diamond and Debbie Johnson who are looking to escape to the countryside and fall in love watching the seasons change.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about Emma Davies:  &lt;br /&gt;‘One of the most &lt;b&gt;heartfelt and captivating&lt;/b&gt; books I have read this year. &lt;b&gt;Beautifully emotional, this book has it all&lt;/b&gt;. Such a joy to devour and &lt;b&gt;I recommend this book with all of my heart.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;The Writing Garnet&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘This is the &lt;b&gt;perfect read for book lovers everywhere…&lt;/b&gt; Books, friendship and a sprinkling of romance, the &lt;b&gt;perfect feel good combo&lt;/b&gt;.’ Heidi Swain, author of &lt;i&gt;Sleigh Rides and Silver Bells at the Christmas Fair&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘What &lt;b&gt;delightful treat&lt;/b&gt; the book was… in fact it was &lt;b&gt;a warm hug of a story, a joy from beginning to end&lt;/b&gt;.’ Liz Fenwick, author of &lt;i&gt;The Cornish House&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;My favourite book of 2017&lt;/b&gt;.

It's the truth – but not the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve years later, Finn has built a new life with Ellen, Layla's sister, when he receives a phone call. Someone has seen Layla. But is it her – or someone pretending to be her? If it is her, what does she want? And what does she know about the night she disappeared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bring Me Back&lt;/i&gt; is the utterly compelling, white-knuckle thriller from &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller B A Paris.</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>Marnie Salt has made so many mistakes in her life that she fears she will never get on the right track. But when she ‘meets’ an old lady on a baking chatroom and begins confiding in her, little does she know how her life will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arranging to see each other for lunch, Marnie finds discovers that Lilian is every bit as mad and delightful as she’d hoped – and that she owns a whole village in the Yorkshire Dales, which has been passed down through generations. And when Marnie needs a refuge after a crisis, she ups sticks and heads for Wychwell – a temporary measure, so she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon Marnie finds that Wychwell has claimed her as its own and she is duty bound not to leave. Even if what she has to do makes her as unpopular as a force 12 gale in a confetti factory! But everyone has imperfections, as Marnie comes to realise, and that is not such a bad thing – after all, your flaws are perfect for the heart that is meant to love you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Perfectly Imperfect Woman is the heart-warming and hilarious new novel from the queen of feel-good fiction – a novel of family, secrets, love and redemption … and broken hearts mended and made all the stronger for it.</description>

  <description>Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>Marnie Salt has made so many mistakes in her life that she fears she will never get on the right track. But when she ‘meets’ an old lady on a baking chatroom and begins confiding in her, little does she know how her life will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arranging to see each other for lunch, Marnie finds discovers that Lilian is every bit as mad and delightful as she’d hoped – and that she owns a whole village in the Yorkshire Dales, which has been passed down through generations. And when Marnie needs a refuge after a crisis, she ups sticks and heads for Wychwell – a temporary measure, so she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon Marnie finds that Wychwell has claimed her as its own and she is duty bound not to leave. Even if what she has to do makes her as unpopular as a force 12 gale in a confetti factory! But everyone has imperfections, as Marnie comes to realise, and that is not such a bad thing – after all, your flaws are perfect for the heart that is meant to love you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Perfectly Imperfect Woman is the heart-warming and hilarious new novel from the queen of feel-good fiction – a novel of family, secrets, love and redemption … and broken hearts mended and made all the stronger for it.</description>

  <description>There’s a letter on the floor covered with blood next to a heart-shaped box of chocolates. The note says: ‘My beautiful darling, I’m sorry, please forgive me.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the body of a man is found with his wrists slashed in a London hotel room, it appears at first to be a tragic suicide. But Detective Dan Riley suspects there is more to this case than meets the eye and the pathology report confirms his worst fears – the victim was poisoned and suddenly Dan is dealing with a murder inquiry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he makes a disturbing discovery, uncovering links between the victim and a woman calling herself Goldilocks on an online dating site. Is she seeking revenge or something more? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still grieving the devastating loss of his girlfriend and unborn child in a car accident two years ago, Dan throws everything he has into the investigation. Yet just as Dan begins to piece together the clues of this complex case, the body of a woman is found in her bed with identical wounds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan is on the trail of a twisted individual who is much closer than he realises. Can he overcome his own demons and stop the killer before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-consuming and totally unputdownable read that will have you holding your breath to the very last page. Perfect for fans of Rachel Abbott, Robert Bryndza and Karin Slaughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously called Last Cry</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The perfect family... or the perfect lie?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a child’s scream pierces the night, &lt;b&gt;Mira&lt;/b&gt; does what any good neighbour would do: she calls the police. She wants to make sure that &lt;b&gt;Rosie&lt;/b&gt;, the little girl next door, is safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opening her front door to the police the next morning, &lt;b&gt;Gemma’s&lt;/b&gt; picture-perfect family is forced under scrutiny of social services. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As her flawless life begins to crumble around her, Gemma must fight to defend the family she loves and protect her daughter from the terrible secret she’s been keeping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But who has Rosie been confiding in when Gemma’s back is turned? And why has she lied to the police?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Rosie disappears without a trace, Gemma thinks she only has herself to blame. &lt;b&gt;That is, until she finds a little pink diary containing a truth even more devastating than the lie…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you loved &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll adore this razor-sharp, tense and utterly engrossing page turner about the people we choose to trust and the secrets we keep behind closed doors.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-five years ago Katie ran away from home and never came back. But now she’s suddenly reappeared in her best friend Olivia’s life—in the form of a chilling confession. Olivia’s father-in-law, wracked with guilt, says he murdered her all those years ago. Tom suffers from Alzheimer’s and his story is riddled with error and confusion. Except for one terrifying certainty: he knows where the body is buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Olivia and the police piece together the evidence, they are left with one critical question. They have a crime, they have a confession, and now they have a body—but can any of it be trusted?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The perfect family... or the perfect lie?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a child’s scream pierces the night, &lt;b&gt;Mira&lt;/b&gt; does what any good neighbour would do: she calls the police. She wants to make sure that &lt;b&gt;Rosie&lt;/b&gt;, the little girl next door, is safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opening her front door to the police the next morning, &lt;b&gt;Gemma’s&lt;/b&gt; picture-perfect family is forced under scrutiny of social services. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As her flawless life begins to crumble around her, Gemma must fight to defend the family she loves and protect her daughter from the terrible secret she’s been keeping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But who has Rosie been confiding in when Gemma’s back is turned? And why has she lied to the police?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Rosie disappears without a trace, Gemma thinks she only has herself to blame. &lt;b&gt;That is, until she finds a little pink diary containing a truth even more devastating than the lie…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you loved &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll adore this razor-sharp, tense and utterly engrossing page turner about the people we choose to trust and the secrets we keep behind closed doors.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A MISSING CHILD. A DEAD WOMAN. A SHOCKING MYSTERY. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six-year-old Lola Jade Harper is taken from her bedroom. Her mother is distraught. She is convinced her estranged husband, Gavin Harper, has abducted their daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Rachel Prince is leading the investigation but is soon out of her depth as she searches for the most high-profile missing child in the country. To uncover the truth about Lola’s disappearance, Rachel must untangle the Harper family’s complicated web of secrets and lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the case progresses, the body of a local woman is found. The death at first seems unrelated, until a trail of social media posts lead Rachel to a chilling discovery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then another little girl is taken…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With growing pressure from the public and the appearance of someone from her past she’d rather forget, will Rachel be able to solve the connection between the two missing children and the murder - before it’s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly addictive from start to finish, &lt;i&gt;The Missing Child&lt;/i&gt; is a tense, enthralling crime thriller by one of the best new voices in crime fiction. Perfect for fans of Angela Marsons, Peter James and Karin Slaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously called The Missing Child</description>

  <description>What would you do if the person you loved suddenly vanished into thin air?&lt;br /&gt;Catherine’s cosy life as a housewife and mum-of-three is quickly thrown into disarray when husband Simon disappears without explanation. She is convinced he hasn’t left by choice as confusion and spiraling debts threaten to tear her family apart.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Simon has begun a carefree new life travelling the world. And he’s determined not to disclose his past to all he meets, even if it means resorting to extreme and violent measures.&lt;br /&gt;But why did he leave? &lt;br /&gt;Catherine only gets her answer 25 years later when Simon suddenly reappears on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;During their furious final confrontation, they discover the secrets, lies and misunderstandings that tore them apart, then brought them face-to-face one last time.</description>

  <description>8 hours, 4 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are three sides to every story: Yours. Mine. And the truth…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max and Alissa have a fairy tale life—newlywed, madly in love and enviously rich. Then Max is brutally stabbed to death at their home and Alissa, miraculously, escapes with her life. But why was she spared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hunt for the killer begins, uncovering a number of leads—was Max’s incredible wealth the motive? Had his shady business practices finally caught up with him? Or was it a stalker with a dangerous obsession?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted friends rally around gentle, sweet Alissa as she is left to mourn the loss of her husband and pick up her life. But not everyone is who they seem…Deep-rooted jealousies, secrets and twisted love lie just beneath the surface, and not all fairy tales have a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Duplicity&lt;/i&gt; is a suspenseful thriller from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Look Behind You&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Where the Memories Lie&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Yellow Crocus&lt;/i&gt; returns with a haunting and tender story of three women returning to the plantation they once called home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oberlin, Ohio, 1868. Lisbeth Johnson was born into privilege in the antebellum South. Jordan Freedman was born a slave to Mattie, Lisbeth’s beloved nurse. The women have an unlikely bond deeper than friendship. Three years after the Civil War, Lisbeth and Mattie are tending their homes and families while Jordan, an aspiring suffragette, teaches at an integrated school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lisbeth discovers that her father is dying, she’s summoned back to the Virginia plantation where she grew up. There she must face the Confederate family she betrayed by marrying an abolitionist. Jordan and Mattie return to Fair Oaks, too, to save the family they left behind, who still toil in oppression. For Lisbeth, it’s a time for reconciliation. For Jordan and Mattie, it’s time for liberation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Johnsons and Freedmans confront the injustice that binds them, as well as the bitterness and violence that seethes at its heart, the women must find the courage to free their families—and themselves—from the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/i&gt; actor Nick Offerman shares his humorous fulminations on life, manliness, meat, and much more in his first book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Growing a perfect moustache, grilling red meat, wooing a woman—who better to deliver this tutelage than the always charming, always manly Nick Offerman, best known as &lt;i&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/i&gt;’s Ron Swanson?  Combining his trademark comic voice and very real expertise in woodworking—he runs his own woodshop—&lt;i&gt;Paddle Your Own Canoe&lt;/i&gt; features tales from Offerman’s childhood in small-town Minooka, Illinois—“I grew up literally in the middle of a cornfield”—to his theater days in Chicago, beginnings as a carpenter/actor and the hilarious and magnificent seduction of his now-wife Megan Mullally.   It also offers hard-bitten battle strategies in the arenas of manliness, love, style, religion, woodworking, and outdoor recreation, among many other savory entrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A mix of amusing anecdotes, opinionated lessons and rants, sprinkled with offbeat gaiety, &lt;i&gt;Paddle Your Own Canoe&lt;/i&gt; will not only tickle readers pink but may also rouse them to put down their smart phones, study a few sycamore leaves, and maybe even hand craft (and paddle) their own canoes.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An astonishingly incisive and suspenseful novel about a scandal amongst Britain's privileged elite and the women caught up in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie's husband James is a loving father, a handsome man, a charismatic and successful public figure. And yet he stands accused of a terrible crime. Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to rip them apart. Kate is the lawyer hired to prosecute the case: an experienced professional who knows that the law is all about winning the argument. And yet Kate seeks the truth at all times. She is certain James is guilty and is determined he will pay for his crimes. Who is right about James? Sophie or Kate? And is either of them informed by anything more than instinct and personal experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her privileged upbringing, Sophie is well aware that her beautiful life is not inviolable. She has known it since she and James were first lovers, at Oxford, and she witnessed how easily pleasure could tip into tragedy. Most people would prefer not to try to understand what passes between a man and a woman when they are alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in an elevator... Or alone in the moonlit courtyard of an Oxford college, where a girl once stood before a boy, heart pounding with excitement, then fear. Sophie never understood why her tutorial partner Holly left Oxford so abruptly. What would she think, if she knew the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mattie was never truly mine. That knowledge must have filled me as quickly and surely as the milk from her breasts. Although my family ‘owned’ her, although she occupied the center of my universe, her deepest affections lay elsewhere. So along with the comfort of her came the fear that I would lose her some day. This is our story...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins Lisbeth Wainwright’s compelling tale of coming-of-age in antebellum Virginia. Born to white plantation owners but raised by her enslaved black wet nurse, Mattie, Lisbeth’s childhood unfolds on the line between two very different worlds. Growing up under the tender care of Mattie, Lisbeth adopts her surrogate mother’s deep-seated faith in God, her love of music and black-eyed peas, and the tradition of hunting for yellow crocuses in the early days of spring. In time, Lisbeth realizes she has freedoms and opportunities that Mattie does not have, though she’s confined by the societal expectations placed on women born to privilege. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lisbeth grows up, she struggles to reconcile her love for her caregiver with her parents’ expectations, a task made all the more difficult as she becomes increasingly aware of the ugly realities of the American slavery system. When Lisbeth bears witness to a shockingly brutal act, the final vestiges of her naiveté crumble around her. Lisbeth realizes she must make a choice, one that will require every ounce of the courage she learned from her beloved Mattie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compelling historical novel is a richly evocative tale of love, loss, and redemption set during one of the most sinister chapters of American history.' &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time, a woman called Lucy ran a little library with a big heart. It only took one look at the members of her book club for Lucy to see how she could make all their dreams come true…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full-time carer &lt;b&gt;Lia&lt;/b&gt; dreams of learning to dance, but as her mother becomes more reliant on her, that wish may never come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Widower &lt;b&gt;Oscar&lt;/b&gt; is longing to find the daughter he put up for adoption as a young man, but does she even want to be found? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single mum &lt;b&gt;Hattie&lt;/b&gt; is overweight and unhappy since her cheating ex-fiancé humiliated her at their engagement party. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sensitive soul &lt;b&gt;Callum&lt;/b&gt; is a hopeless romantic and the black sheep of his family. Will he ever find the courage to fight for what he wants? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucy has a plan to give these four strangers the happy endings they deserve, and in doing so, she might just find one for herself...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A life-affirming, emotional page-turner that will bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face. Perfect for fans of Jenny Colgan and Milly Johnson.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You Love Him. You Trust Him. So Why Are You So Scared?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, Dennis Danson was arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of a young girl. Now he’s the subject of a true-crime documentary that’s whipping up a frenzy online to uncover the truth and free a man who has been wrongly convicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thousand miles away in England, Samantha is obsessed with Dennis’s case. She exchanges letters with him, and is quickly won over by his apparent charm and kindness to her. Soon she has left her old life behind to marry him and campaign for his release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the campaign is successful and Dennis is freed, however, Sam begins to discover new details that suggest he may not be quite so innocent after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But how do you confront your husband when you don’t want to know the truth?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description> They thought they were safe. They were wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;The murder of a young prostitute and a baby found abandoned on the same winter night signals the start of a disturbing investigation for &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; – one which brings her face to face with someone from her own horrific childhood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As three more sex workers are murdered in quick succession, each death more violent than the last, Kim and her team realise that the initial killing was no one-off frenzied attack, but a twisted serial killer preying on the vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the same time, the search begins for the desperate woman who left her newborn baby at the station – but what looks like a tragic abandonment turns even more sinister when a case of modern slavery is uncovered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The two investigations bring the team into a terrifying world of human exploitation and cruelty – and a showdown that puts Kim’s life at risk as shocking secrets from her own past come to light. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the summer of 2006, Emma Price watched helplessly as her six-year-old son's red coat was fished out of the River Ouse. It was the tragic story of the year - a little boy, Aiden, wandered away from school during a terrible flood, fell into the river, and drowned. His body was never recovered. Ten years later, Emma has finally rediscovered the joy in life. She's married, pregnant, and in control again... ... until Aiden returns. Too traumatized to speak, he raises endless questions and answers none. Only his body tells the story of his decade-long disappearance. The historic broken bones and injuries cast a mere glimpse into the horrors Aiden has experienced. Aiden never drowned. Aiden was taken. As Emma attempts to reconnect with her now teenage son, she must unmask the monster who took him away from her. But who, in their tiny village, could be capable of such a crime? It's Aiden who has the answers, but he cannot tell the unspeakable. This dark and disturbing psychological novel will appeal to fans of The Widow and The Butterfly Garden.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The floor was stone cold on her bare skin. Her heart pounded in her chest. ‘Not a soul knows where I am,’ she thought as she took in the darkness around her. And then she heard his footsteps…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a body is found stuffed into a barrel at a garbage dump, covered in long red lacerations, Detective Jenna Alton and her new deputy, David Kane, rush to the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever happens in the small American town of Black Rock Falls, so Jenna believes the victim must be one of two recent missing persons, and she fears for the life of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both were strangers to the town, but there’s nothing else to link them. Jenna knows someone must have seen something, but no one’s talking; how well does she really know the people around her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a disturbing clue makes Jenna suspect a connection with other disappearances in the town’s history. Just when she begins asking the right questions, she realises she’s being followed. Is she next on the killer’s list?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a race against time, Jenna and David must unlock the dark secret at the heart of the town, before it’s too late… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A completely addictive detective thriller that will have you guessing right to the end. Perfect for readers of Robert Dugoni, Karin Slaughter and Rachel Abbott.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The body of a young City lawyer is discovered on an East London building site, assaulted and brutally murdered. Initial enquiries lead DI Simon Fenchurch to a driver employed by Travis, a controversial new app-based cab company. Within days another woman - a Travis driver - is found murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count goes up, DI Fenchurch and his colleagues on the East London Major Investigation Team delve into the crimes and unveil a murky conspiracy that some will do anything to keep hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When familiar faces begin to emerge from the shadows, Fenchurch realises this case is more personal than he’d thought. Could he finally be on the brink of solving the mystery that has dogged him for over a decade: who abducted his daughter, Chloe - and where is she now?</description>

  <description>At Windemere School for Girls, one of America’s elite private schools, Dr. Gregory Copeland is the beloved chair of the English Department. A married father with a penchant for romantic poetry—and impressionable teenage girls—he operates in plain sight for years, until one of his former students goes public with allegations of inappropriate conduct. With the help of an investigative journalist, and two additional Windemere alumnae who had relationships with Copeland as students, the unlikely quartet unites to take him down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in modern-day Los Angeles, These Violent Delights is a literary exploration of the unyielding pressures and vulnerabilities that so many women and girls experience, and analyzes the ways in which our institutions and families fail to protect or defend us. A suspenseful and nuanced story told from multiple points of view, the novel examines themes of sexuality, trauma, revenge, and the American myth of liberty and justice for all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She fell in love with a killer, now she’s one too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The suitcase was badly rusted, and took Erika several attempts, but it yielded and sagged open as she unzipped it. Nothing could prepare her for what she would find inside…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a battered suitcase containing the dismembered body of a young man washes up on the shore of the river Thames, Detective Erika Foster is shocked. She’s worked on some terrifying cases but never seen anything like this before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Erika and her team set to work, she makes the link with another victim – the body of a young woman dumped in an identical suitcase two weeks ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erika quickly realises she’s on the trail of a serial killer who’s already made their next move. Yet just as Erika starts to make headway with the investigation, she is the victim of a brutal attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing will stop Erika. As the body count rises, the twin daughters of her colleague Commander Marsh are abducted, and the stakes are higher than ever before. Can Erika save the lives of two innocent children before it’s too late? She’s running out of time and about to make a disturbing discovery…&lt;b&gt;there’s more than one killer.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Someone lied. Someone died...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This dark, twisting novel from the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tasmina Perry will keep you on the edge of your seat. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect for everyone who's been gripped by Showtime TV's &lt;i&gt;The Affair&lt;/i&gt;, Adele Parks' &lt;i&gt;The Stranger In My Home&lt;/i&gt; and J. P. Delaney's &lt;i&gt;The Girl Before&lt;/i&gt;. 'Gripping... Great pace and brilliantly written. I loved it' &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;The House on Sunset Lake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you're invited to spend summer in the Hamptons with a group of new friends, you agree - who wouldn't? But then you realise you're taking the place of another woman, a woman who died in mysterious circumstances, just the summer before. Your housemates tell you her death was an accident. But which of them has something to hide?</description>

  <description>On a busy London street, a young woman is attacked in broad daylight and left bleeding to death on the pavement. Among the eyewitnesses are DI Simon Fenchurch and his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fenchurch pursues the attacker through a warren of backstreets and eventually arrests a young hoodie with a cache of stolen phones - an ‘Apple picker’ on the make. The case should be closed but something feels off ... Was this really just about a smartphone? Why did the victim look nervous &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; she was targeted? And why don’t the prints on the murder weapon match the young man in custody?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Fenchurch can probe further, his superiors remove him from the case, convinced he has let the real culprit run free. But Fenchurch is determined to get to the truth and, before long, uncovers a conspiracy that reaches high above the street gangs of London.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What would it take to make you intervene?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella Longfield overhears two attractive young men flirting with teenage girls on a train, she thinks nothing of it—until she realises they are fresh out of prison and her maternal instinct is put on high alert. But just as she’s decided to call for help, something stops her. The next day, she wakes up to the news that one of the girls—beautiful, green-eyed Anna Ballard—has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, Anna is still missing. Ella is wracked with guilt over what she failed to do, and she’s not the only one who can’t forget. Someone is sending her threatening letters—letters that make her fear for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an anniversary appeal reveals that Anna’s friends and family might have something to hide. Anna’s best friend, Sarah, hasn’t been telling the whole truth about what really happened that night—and her parents have been keeping secrets of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone knows where Anna is—and they’re not telling. But they are watching Ella.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When she woke, she found herself in darkness. She couldn’t move. She was going to die and she had no idea why...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early one icy winter morning, &lt;b&gt;Detective Alex King&lt;/b&gt; is called to a murder scene at a local park. The river is running high, and in the water lies the body of a woman, her wrists tied, and all her fingernails missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim, beautiful, young &lt;b&gt;Lola Evans&lt;/b&gt;, had a troubled past, but Alex’s team can’t find a reason why anyone would want to kill her. The pressure to solve the case keeps mounting, but all their leads run dry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then, another body is found in the water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disturbing clue suggests how the girls are connected. But who would target such vulnerable girls, and does this mean another life is at risk? Just when Alex thinks she has cracked the case, she realises one of her own team is in terrible danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex is caught in a race against time to reach the next victim before it’s too late... and some of her team must face terrifying truths from their own lives if they’re to have a chance of catching the killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tess and Gus are meant to be. They just haven't met properly yet. And perhaps they never will . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first day of the rest of your life is the motto on a plate in the kitchen at home, and Tess can't get it out of her head, even though she's in Florence for a final, idyllic holiday before university. Her life is about to change forever - but not in the way she expects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gus and his parents are also on holiday in Florence. Their lives have already changed suddenly and dramatically. Gus tries to be a dutiful son, but longs to escape and discover what sort of person he is going to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one day, the paths of an eighteen-year-old girl and boy criss-cross before they each return to England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the next sixteen years, life and love will offer them very different challenges. Separated by distance and fate, there's no way the two of them are ever going to meet each other properly . . . or is there?</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1999, Kit and Laura travel to a festival in Cornwall to see a total eclipse of the sun. Kit is an eclipse chaser; Laura has never seen one before. Young and in love, they are certain this will be the first of many they’ll share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the hushed moments after the shadow passes, Laura interrupts a man and a woman. She knows that she saw something terrible. The man denies it. It is her word against his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim seems grateful. Months later, she turns up on their doorstep like a lonely stray. But as her gratitude takes a twisted turn, Laura begins to wonder—did she trust the wrong person? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 years later, Kit and Laura are living under assumed names and completely off the digital grid: no Facebook, only rudimentary cell phones, not in any directories. But as the truth catches up to them, they realize they can no longer keep the past in the past.</description>

  <description>It's the beginning of the summer in a small town in Ireland. Emma O'Donovan is eighteen years old, beautiful, happy, confident. One night, there's a party. Everyone is there. All eyes are on Emma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, she wakes on the front porch of her house. She can't remember what happened, she doesn't know how she got there. She doesn't know why she's in pain. But everyone else does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photographs taken at the party show, in explicit detail, what happened to Emma that night. But sometimes people don't want to believe what is right in front of them, especially when the truth concerns the town's heroes...</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was rushed, unemotional and completely pointless. I thought it had good potential but I thought it felt too rushed and at times a bit unrealistic. Didn't see the point in one aspect of the story. All in all it should not be being compared to Jodi Picoult.]]>

  <description>A stolen baby. A murdered woman. A decades-old atrocity. Something connects them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month before Christmas, and Ballyterrin on the Irish border lies under a thick pall of snow. When a newborn baby goes missing from hospital, it's all too close to home for forensic psychologist Paula Maguire, who's wrestling with the hardest decision of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a woman is found in a stone circle with her stomach cut open and it's clear a brutal killer is on the loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another child is taken and a pregnant woman goes missing, Paula is caught up in the hunt for a killer no one can trace, who will stop at nothing to get what they want.</description>

      <![CDATA[Absolutely loved this book! The fact it's set in Northern Ireland and I can relate to some of the surroundings and themes in it made it so much better. This is the second book in the series and I'm going to read the third straight away!! I'd recommend this series to anyone, brilliant!]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not everyone who's missing is lost...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two teenage girls go missing along the Irish border, forensic psychologist Paula Maguire has to return to the hometown she left years before. Swirling with rumour and secrets, the town is gripped by fear of a serial killer. But the truth could be even darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not everyone who's lost wants to be found...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by people and places she tried to forget, Paula digs into the cases as the truth twists further away. What's the link with two other disappearances from 1985? And why does everything lead back to the town's dark past- including the reasons her own mother went missing years before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing is what it seems...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the shocking truth is revealed, Paula learns that sometimes, it's better not to find what you've lost.</description>

  <description>In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?</description>

  <description>When Lewis Harley has a health scare in his early forties, he takes it as a wake-up call. So he and his wife Charlotte leave behind life in the fast lane and Lewis opens the antique shop he has dreamed of. Bonnie Brookland was brought up in the antiques trade and now works for the man who bought out her father’s business, but she isn’t happy there. So when she walks into Lew’s shop, she knows this is the place for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bonnie and Lew start to work together, they soon realise that there is more to their relationship than either thought. But Bonnie is trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Lew and Charlotte have more problems than they care to admit. Each has secrets in their past which are about to be uncovered. Can they find the happiness they both deserve?</description>

  <description>The small town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, is a jewel in Lancaster County - known for its picture-postcard landscapes and bucolic lifestyle. But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live plain. As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires.</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Trixie Stone is in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father, Daniel's life -- a straight-A student; a pretty, popular freshman in high school; a girl who's always seen her father as a hero. That is, until her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence. Suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie. Could the boyfriend who once made Trixie wild with happiness have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a seemingly mild-mannered comic book artist with a secret tumultuous past he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back to protect his daughter. &lt;p&gt; With &lt;i&gt;The Tenth Circle&lt;/i&gt;, Jodi Picoult offers her most powerful chronicle yet as she explores the unbreakable bond between parent and child, and questions whether you can reinvent yourself in the course of a lifetime -- or if your mistakes are carried forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Willow is born with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, her parents are devastated--she will suffer hundreds of broken bones as she grows, a lifetime of pain. Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of "luckier" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it's all worth it because Willow is, funny as it seems, perfect. She's smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes, though, after a series of events forces Charlotte and her husband to confront the most serious what-ifs of all. What if Charlotte had known earlier of Willow's illness? What if things could have been different? What if their beloved Willow had never been born? To do Willow justice, Charlotte must ask herself these questions and one more. What constitutes a valuable life?</description>

  <description> The truth was dead and buried…until now.  &lt;br /&gt;When a collection of human bones is unearthed during a routine archaeological dig, a Black Country field suddenly becomes a complex crime scene for &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the bones are sorted, it becomes clear that the grave contains more than one victim. The bodies hint at unimaginable horror, bearing the markings of bullet holes and animal traps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to work alongside Detective Travis, with whom she shares a troubled past, Kim begins to uncover a dark secretive relationship between the families who own the land in which the bodies were found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But while Kim is immersed in one of the most complicated investigations she’s ever led, her team are caught up in a spate of sickening hate crimes. Kim is close to revealing the truth behind the murders, yet soon finds one of her own is in jeopardy - and the clock is ticking. Can she solve the case and save them from grave danger – before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;1. I’m in a coma.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3. Sometimes I lie.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?</description>

  <description>He’s your perfect date. You’re his next victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tortured body of a young woman is found in a dumpster, her eyes swollen shut and her clothes soaked with blood, Detective Erika Foster is one of the first at the crime scene. The trouble is, this time, it’s not her case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she fights to secure her place on the investigation team, Erika can’t help but get involved and quickly finds a link to the unsolved murder of a woman four months earlier. Dumped in a similar location, both women have identical wounds – a fatal incision to their femoral artery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stalking his victims online, the killer is preying on young pretty women using a fake identity. How will Erika catch a murderer who doesn’t seem to exist? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then another girl is abducted while waiting for a date. Erika and her team must get to her before she becomes another dead victim, and, come face to face with a terrifyingly sadistic individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping, tense and impossible to put down, Last Breath will have you on the edge of your seat, racing to the final dramatic page.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this book and this series! It was brilliant knowing who the murderer was early on and being frustrated with the detectives, it made it different to other crime books. Seeing the crime from the killers point of view and the reactions to news about the murders was a good concept. Can't wait...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can’t stop the future. &lt;br /&gt;You can’t rewind the past.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to learn the secret . . . is to press play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker–his classmate and crush–who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah’s voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he’ll find out why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah’s pain, and as he follows Hannah’s recorded words throughout his town, what he discovers changes his life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You don’t know him. But he knows you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Soon he would be able to touch her, to feel the warmth of her blood. And when the time came, nothing would stop him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;b&gt;D.C. Jennifer Knight&lt;/b&gt; investigates a routine stabbing in the quiet town of Haven, she is shocked at what seems like a personal message from beyond the grave.&lt;br /&gt;When more bodies are found, Jennifer is convinced the killings are somehow linked. What she discovers is more chilling than she could possibly imagine. The murders mirror those of the notorious Grim Reaper – from over twenty years ago. A killer her mother helped convict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer can no longer ignore the personal connection. Is there a copycat killer at work? Was the wrong man convicted? Or is there something more sinister at play …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her mother’s terrifying legacy spiralling out of control, Jennifer must look into her own dark past in a fight not only to stop a killer – but to save herself and those she loves.</description>

  <description>The body of a young woman is found on the streets of East London, in the shadow of the City’s gleaming towers. No ID on her, just hard-earned cash. But there is no doubting the ferocity of the attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Simon Fenchurch takes charge but, as his team tries to identify her and piece together her murder, they’re faced with cruel indifference at every turn - nobody cares about yet another dead prostitute. To Fenchurch, however, she could just as easily be Chloe, his daughter still missing after ten years, whose memory still haunts his days and nights, his burning obsession having killed his marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a second body is discovered, Fenchurch must peel back the grimy layers shrouding the London sex trade, confronting his own traumatic past while racing to undo a scheme larger, more complex and more evil than anything he could possibly have imagined.</description>

  <description>Beneath the water the body sank rapidly. She would lie still and undisturbed for many years but above her on dry land, the nightmare was just beginning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Detective Erika Foster receives a tip-off that key evidence for a major narcotics case was stashed in a disused quarry on the outskirts of London, she orders for it to be searched. From the thick sludge the drugs are recovered, but so is the skeleton of a young child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remains are quickly identified as seven-year-old Jessica Collins. The missing girl who made headline news twenty-six years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Erika tries to piece together new evidence with the old, she must dig deeper and find out more about the fractured Collins family and the original detective, Amanda Baker. A woman plagued by her failure to find Jessica. Erika soon realises this is going to be one of the most complex and demanding cases she has ever taken on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the suspect someone close to home? Someone is keeping secrets. Someone who doesn’t want this case solved. And they’ll do anything to stop Erika from finding the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the million-copy bestselling author of The Girl in the Ice and The Night Stalker, comes the third heart-stopping book in the Detective Erika Foster series.</description>

  <description>A poignant, intimate, funny, inspiring memoir—both a coming-of-age story and a meditation on creativity, devotion, and craft—from Bryan Cranston, beloved and acclaimed star of one of history’s most successful TV shows, &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father cast him in a United Way commercial. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Destiny suddenly took a backseat to survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in his riveting memoir, Cranston maps his zigzag journey from abandoned son to beloved star by recalling the many odd parts he’s played in real life—paperboy, farmhand, security guard, dating consultant, murder suspect, dock loader, lover, husband, father. Cranston also chronicles his evolution on camera, from soap opera player trying to master the rules of show business to legendary character actor turning in classic performances as &lt;i&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/i&gt; dentist Tim Whatley, “a sadist with newer magazines,” and &lt;i&gt;Malcolm in the Middle&lt;/i&gt; dad Hal Wilkerson, a lovable bumbler in tighty-whities. He also gives an inspiring account of how he prepared, physically and mentally, for the challenging role of President Lyndon Johnson, a tour de force that won him a Tony to go along with his four Emmys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Cranston dives deep into the grittiest details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most memorable performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussing his life as few men do, describing his art as few actors can, Cranston has much to say about creativity, devotion, and craft, as well as innate talent and its challenges and benefits and proper maintenance. But ultimately &lt;i&gt;A Life in Parts &lt;/i&gt;is a story about the joy, the necessity, and the transformative power of simple hard work.</description>

  <description>If the Night Stalker is watching, you’re already dead… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dead of a swelteringly hot summer’s night, Detective Erika Foster is called to a murder scene. The victim, a doctor, is found suffocated in bed. His wrists are bound and his eyes bulging through a clear plastic bag tied tight over his head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, another victim is found dead, in exactly the same circumstances. As Erika and her team start digging deeper, they discover a calculated serial killer – stalking their victims before choosing the right moment to strike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victims are all single men, with very private lives. Why are their pasts shrouded in secrecy? And what links them to the killer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a heat wave descends upon London, Erika will do everything to stop the Night Stalker before the body count rises, even if it means risking her job. But the victims might not be the only ones being watched… Erika’s own life could be on the line.</description>

  <description>Dan Cooper has never been the perfect husband to Lisa. He travels for work and plays the carefree bachelor when he can. But now, on a solo business trip, in a remote coastal hotel, he’s surprised to find Lisa in his bathroom. She’s dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has no idea how she got there but one chilling fact is clear: everything points to Dan having murdered her. Someone is trying to frame him. Someone who might still be watching. In a panic, he goes on the run. But even as he flees across Europe, his unknown enemy stacks up the evidence against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan is determined to clear his name and take revenge on Lisa’s killer, but the culprit is closing in. And then there’s the agony of his own guilty conscience. No, he didn’t kill her—but is it all his fault?</description>

  <description>The last people who expect to be meeting with a drug-addicted prostitute are a respected judge and his reclusive wife. And they certainly don't plan to kill her and bury her in their exquisite suburban garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Andrew and Lydia Fitzsimons find themselves in this unfortunate situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Lydia does all she can to protect their innocent son Laurence and their social standing, her husband begins to falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Laurence is not as naïve as Lydia thinks. And his obsession with the dead girl's family may be the undoing of his own.</description>

  <description>Number 11, Dukes Square, looks just like the other houses on the Brighton seafront: a Regency terrace with elegant sash windows, a winding staircase, and post piled up in the hall for its tenants. It might be part of the city's history, but it's also a place of brand new beginnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgie has followed her childhood sweetheart to Brighton but is determined to carve out a career for herself in journalism. Throwing herself into the city's delights is fun and exciting, but before she knows it, she's sliding into all kinds of trouble . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte's in the city for a new start, hoping to keep her head down and somehow get over the heartbreaking loss she's suffered in the past. But Margot, the stylish old lady on the top floor, has other ideas. Like it or not, Charlotte must confront the outside world, and the possibilities it still holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrible revelation sent Rosa running from London to start again as a sous chef. The work is gruelling and thankless but it's a distraction at least . . . until she comes up against the stroppy teenager next door who challenges her on her lifestyle choices. What if Rosa's passion for food could lead her to more interesting places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the three tenants find each other, it's as if a whole new chapter of their lives has begun. &lt;i&gt;The House of New Beginnings&lt;/i&gt; is a moving and uplifting novel from bestselling author Lucy Diamond.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rainn Wilson’s memoir about growing up geeky and finally finding his place in comedy, faith, and life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For nine seasons Rainn Wilson played Dwight Schrute, everyone's favorite work nemesis and beet farmer. Viewers of &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; fell in love with the character and grew to love the actor who played him even more. Rainn founded a website and media company, SoulPancake, that eventually became a bestselling book of the same name. He also started a hilarious Twitter feed (sample tweet: “I'm not on Facebook” is the new “I don't even own a TV”) that now has more than four million followers.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now, he's ready to tell his own story and explain how he came up with his incredibly unique sense of humor and perspective on life. He explains how he grew up “bone-numbingly nerdy before there was even a modicum of cool attached to the word.” &lt;i&gt;The Bassoon King&lt;/i&gt; chronicles his journey from nerd to drama geek (“the highest rung on the vast, pimply ladder of high school losers”), his years of mild debauchery and struggles as a young actor in New York, his many adventures and insights about &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt;, and finally, Wilson's achievement of success and satisfaction, both in his career and spiritually, reconnecting with the artistic and creative values of the Bahá’í faith he grew up in.</description>

  <description>Beyond the shores of Hope’s Peak, North Carolina, evil waits as his next victim approaches. He’ll make her a princess like the others…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Jane Harper can’t shake the image of the young woman discovered in a field—eyes closed, a crown of woven vines on her head. She expects macabre murders like this in her native San Francisco, not here. Jane and her partner, Stu, vow to catch the killer, but in this town, that’s easier said than done. The police department is in the grips of a wide-reaching scandal that could topple the entire force, and Jane and Stu face a series of dead ends. Until they meet Ida Lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ida knows too well the evil that lurks in the cornfields. Tortured by her mother’s murder years before, Ida is paralyzed by the fear that she could be next. As the killer grows bolder, Jane must persuade Ida to use her remarkable gifts to help in the investigation. It’s a decision that brings them closer to the killer…maybe too close.</description>

  <description>How do you catch a killer who leaves no trace?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A victim killed with a single, precise stab to the heart appears at first glance to be a robbery gone wrong. A caring, upstanding social worker lost to a senseless act of violence. But for &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt;, something doesn’t add up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a local drug addict is found murdered with an identical wound, Kim knows instinctively that she is dealing with the same killer. But with nothing to link the two victims except the cold, calculated nature of their death, this could be her most difficult case yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to catch the twisted individual, Kim’s focus on the case is threatened when she receives a chilling letter from &lt;b&gt;Dr Alex Thorne&lt;/b&gt;, the sociopath who Kim put behind bars. And this time, Alex is determined to hit where it hurts most, bringing Kim face-to-face with the woman responsible for the death of Kim’s little brother – her own mother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the body count increases, Kim and her team unravel a web of dark secrets, bringing them closer to the killer. But one of their own could be in mortal danger. Only this time, Kim might not be strong enough to save them… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tamsin and Michelle have been inseparable since childhood. Even now they spend all their time together, along with Patrick, Michelle's handsome husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Tamsin's brilliant assistant Bea (without whom Tamsin's life would fall apart) has heard a nasty rumour that Patrick is playing away. Determined to uncover the truth, Tamsin devises a honey-trap to test his resolve, using Bea as bait. But she never counted on Bea having her own agenda . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to untangle the web of deceit, Patrick seems to be constantly one step ahead. Can Tamsin reveal the truth to Michelle without ruining everyone's life along the way?</description>

  <description>Her eyes are wide open. Her lips parted as if to speak. Her dead body frozen in the ice…She is not the only one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young boy discovers the body of a woman beneath a thick sheet of ice in a South London park, Detective Erika Foster is called in to lead the murder investigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim, a beautiful young socialite, appeared to have the perfect life. Yet when Erika begins to dig deeper, she starts to connect the dots between the murder and the killings of three prostitutes, all found strangled, hands bound and dumped in water around London. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What dark secrets is the girl in the ice hiding? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Erika inches closer to uncovering the truth, the killer is closing in on Erika. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last investigation Erika led went badly wrong… resulting in the death of her husband. With her career hanging by a thread, Erika must now battle her own personal demons as well as a killer more deadly than any she’s faced before. But will she get to him before he strikes again?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The dead don't tell secrets... unless you listen. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl's smashed-in face stared unseeing up to the blue sky, soil spilling out of her mouth. A hundred flies hovered above the bloodied mess. Westerley research facility is not for the faint-hearted. A 'body farm' investigating human decomposition, its inhabitants are corpses in various states of decay. But when Detective Kim Stone and her team discover the fresh body of a young woman, it seems a killer has discovered the perfect cover to bury their crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a second girl is attacked and left for dead, her body drugged and mouth filled with soil. It's clear to Stone and the team that a serial killer is at work - but just how many bodies will they uncover? And who is next? As local reporter, Tracy Frost, disappears, the stakes are raised. The past seems to hold the key to the killer's secrets - but can Kim uncover the truth before a twisted, damaged mind claims another victim ...? </description>

  <description> Two girls go missing. Only one will return.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The couple that offers the highest amount will see their daughter again. The losing couple will not. Make no mistake. One child will die.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When nine-year-old best friends Charlie and Amy disappear, two families are plunged into a living nightmare. A text message confirms the unthinkable; that the girls are the victims of a terrifying kidnapping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when a second text message pits the two families against each other for the life of their children, the clock starts ticking for &lt;b&gt;D.I. Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; and the squad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seemingly outwitted at every turn, as they uncover a trail of bodies, Stone realises that these ruthless killers might be the most deadly she has ever faced. And that their chances of bringing the girls home alive, are getting smaller by the hour… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Untangling a dark web of secrets from the families’ past might hold the key to solving this case. But can Kim stay alive long enough to do so? Or will someone’s child pay the ultimate price? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The greater the Evil, the more deadly the game…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a rapist is found mutilated in a brutal attack, Detective Kim Stone and her team are called in to bring a swift resolution. But, as more vengeful killings come to light, it soon becomes clear that there is someone far more sinister at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Kim finds herself exposed to great danger and in the sights of a lethal individual undertaking their own twisted experiment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up against a sociopath who seems to know her every weakness, for Detective Stone, each move she makes could be deadly. As the body count starts to mount, Kim will have to dig deeper than ever before to stop the killing. And this time - it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rising star of the British thriller scene returns with a novel that enthrall fans of Rachel Abbott, Val McDermid and Mark Billingham.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The eight story, nineteen years later …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.</description>

  <description> Even the darkest secrets can’t stay buried forever…  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five figures gather round a shallow grave. They had all taken turns to dig. An adult sized hole would have taken longer. An innocent life had been taken but the pact had been made. Their secrets would be buried, bound in blood …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, a headmistress is found brutally strangled, the first in a spate of gruesome murders which shock the Black Country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when human remains are discovered at a former children’s home, disturbing secrets are also unearthed. &lt;b&gt;D.I. Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; fast realises she’s on the hunt for a twisted individual whose killing spree spans decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the body count rises, Kim needs to stop the murderer before they strike again. But to catch the killer, can Kim confront the demons of her own past before it’s too late?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Fans of Rachel Abbott, Val McDermid and Mark Billingham will be gripped by this exceptional new voice in British crime fiction.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Katie and Eric Knox have dedicated their lives to their fifteen-year-old daughter Devon, a gymnastics prodigy and Olympic hopeful. But when a violent death rocks their close-knit gymnastics community just weeks before an all-important competition, everything the Knoxes have worked so hard for feels suddenly at risk. As rumors swirl among the other parents, revealing hidden plots and allegiances, Katie tries frantically to hold her family together while also finding herself drawn, irresistibly, to the crime itself, and the dark corners it threatens to illuminate. From a writer with "exceptional gifts for making nerves jangle and skin crawl," (Janet Maslin) &lt;i&gt;You Will Know Me&lt;/i&gt; is a breathless rollercoaster of a novel about the desperate limits of desire, jealousy, and ambition.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound by blood. Separated by scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on a ranch in Patagonia, twins Calida and Terisita Santiago have never known a world without each other. Introverted Calida can’t imagine life anywhere else but feisty Terisita dreams of fame and fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World-famous English actress Simone Geddes believes that her profile would benefit from a PR boost and has decided to adopt. A potential family has been identified in Argentina and Simone and her team are en route to a meeting when her driver takes a wrong turn and she ends up at the Santiago ranch. There she becomes enchanted by the beautiful 14 year old Terisita and makes an offer to Julia, the sisters’ mother who has struggled to cope since the death of her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without either twin knowing the truth, Terisita is whisked to a life of luxury in London with Simone. Soon her old life in Argentina is nothing but a distant memory and all she feels is hatred towards the sister who she believes abandoned her. Meanwhile Calida tries to understand how her beloved sister could have turned her back on them and left without a word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the years pass, where the sisters were once connected by love, now it is a shared hatred that fuels them as each one vows revenge…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Santiago Sisters&lt;/i&gt; is a story of the love, loyalty and betrayal which run through the lives of the rich and famous.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I can still recall how cold the pearls felt on my bare neck as Mr Fitzroy secured the clasp, and how heavy they were. I also remember that they were far, far too long for me. But, oh how mesmerising I found those pearls..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia Beaumont-Brown was an IT girl. But now she's in the papers for all the wrong reasons. Single, sofa-surfing and not speaking to her family, only her grandmother has any faith left in her. From her hospital bed, Tilly Beaumont sends Sophia letters about her life: dispatches about wartime England, about family secrets and finally, about the most beautiful thing she ever owned - a necklace of the most incredible pearls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Sophia's prepared to listen, she'll unlock the secret story of generations of incredible women, from the pearl divers of Japan, to high society in pre-war England, and find that the necklace has changed the lives of all who have worn it. The only problem? No one knows where it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia must find out if she's ready to take on the search for something so perfect it can change a life. Wouldn't a girl do anything to hold that in her hands?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For four young women abroad in Paris, a game of Truth or Dare turns life-and-death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I had a secret: I wanted to leave the earth in a spectacular fashion. Specifically, by leaping from the Eiffel Tower.” So begins this provocative coming-of-age novel about a teenage girl bent on self-destruction and revenge, set in the City of Light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the summer of 1999, the end of a millennium. In the mind of Nessa Baxter, a girl from rural Illinois, Paris is the remedy for all of her woes. The death of her beloved brother and the betrayal by her classmate Kat has left Nessa bereft and doubtful about her future. She plans to exact revenge on Kat during their renegade French Club trip. Along with classmates Whitney and Kiran, the four girls embark on a series of misadventures in Paris. As part of her plan, Nessa starts a game of Truth or Dare that spirals out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A suspenseful psychological drama, &lt;i&gt;Midair&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a young girl’s descent into darkness and the secrets we keep, even from ourselves.</description>

Fed up of her good-for-nothing husband and her four, unappreciative children. Well, they hardly notice her anyway, maybe it’s time to shake it up a little…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRACE thought she had the perfect life. Gorgeous little boy and perfect, hardworking husband. Or rather, she did, until she realised her husband was shagging his ‘work’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time for a change – and to ditch the men who are dragging them down! It’s time for A Year of Being Single. Swearing off men, these single ladies don’t need to put a ring on it…right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Jane Costello, Helen Fielding and Fiona Gibson, A Year of Being Single is the laugh-out-loud debut that everyone’s talking about!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Escape to Wildflower Cottage this summer with the brilliant new novel from the Sunday Times bestselling author of The Teashop on the Corner and Afternoon Tea at the Sunflower Café.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viv doesn't like animals. And the feeling is mutual: animals seem to hate Viv too. So when she applies for a job at Wildflower Cottage, a tumbledown animal sanctuary which caters for a variety of unloved animals, she is not sure she will fit in. But then she catches sight of Heath, the owner, and things start looking up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geraldine runs the Wildflower Cottage sanctuary. She's a woman who has a secret in her past and who was drawn to the sanctuary just as Viv was. But her sanctuary is about to come under threat. Can she keep her past a secret and her future safe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home, Viv's mother Stel thinks she might have found a man who will treat her right for once. Ian is kind, considerate, and clearly head over heels for her. That's what she has wanted all along, isn't it...?</description>

  <description>The 2016 debut bloggers can't stop raving about. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt; The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Ice Twins&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You might not want to like them, but you do. Though, you’d like to get to know Grace better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But it’s difficult, because you realise Jack and Grace are never apart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might call this true love. Others might ask why Grace never answers the phone. Or how she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesn’t work. How she can cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim. And why there are bars on one of the bedroom windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the perfect marriage is the perfect lie.</description>

  <description>Near an isolated mansion lies a beautiful garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this garden grow luscious flowers, shady trees…and a collection of precious “butterflies”—young women who have been kidnapped and intricately tattooed to resemble their namesakes. Overseeing it all is the Gardener, a brutal, twisted man obsessed with capturing and preserving his lovely specimens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the garden is discovered, a survivor is brought in for questioning. FBI agents Victor Hanoverian and Brandon Eddison are tasked with piecing together one of the most stomach-churning cases of their careers. But the girl, known only as Maya, proves to be a puzzle herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her story twists and turns, slowly shedding light on life in the Butterfly Garden, Maya reveals old grudges, new saviors, and horrific tales of a man who’d go to any length to hold beauty captive. But the more she shares, the more the agents have to wonder what she’s still hiding...</description>

  <description>No one thinks a seventeen-year-old girl can take on the hard men of London's gangland, but it's a mistake to underestimate Maura Ryan: she's tough, clever and beautiful —and she's determined that nothing will stand in her way. Which makes her one very dangerous lady.&lt;br /&gt;Together, she and her brother Michael are unbeatable: the Queen and King of organised crime, they run the pubs and clubs, the prostitutes and pimps of the West End. With Maura masterminding it, they pull off an audicious gold bullion robbery and have much of the Establishment in their pockets.&lt;br /&gt;But notoriety has its price. The police are determined to put Maura away once and for all —and not everyone in the family thinks that's such a bad idea. When it comes to the crunch, Maura has to face the pain of lost love in her past —and the dangerous lady discovers her heart is not made entirely of stone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When your life is a lie, who can you trust?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Maggie Taylor accepts a new job in Manchester, she is sure it is the right move for her family. The children have settled well although her husband, Duncan, doesn’t appear to be so convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing prepares her for the shock of coming home from work one night to find that Duncan has disappeared, leaving their young children alone. His phone is dead, and she has no idea where he has gone, or why. And then she discovers she’s not the only one looking for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman who looks just like Maggie is brutally murdered and DCI Tom Douglas is brought in to investigate, Maggie realises how little she knows about Duncan’s past. Is he the man she loves? Who is he running from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t have long to decide whether to trust him or betray him. Because one thing has been made clear to Maggie – another woman will die soon, and it might be her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A short novel featuring the same characters as Rachel Abbott’s bestselling novel Stranger Child &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Someone is looking for Tasha. But does she want to be found? &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eight months ago Tasha Joseph ran away, and her stepmother, Emma, has been searching for her ever since. She is desperate to give Tasha the home and security she deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Emma isn’t the only one looking for Tasha. The police are keen to find her too. She could be a vital witness in a criminal trial, and DCI Tom Douglas has a team constantly on the lookout for her. But Tasha remains hidden, and nobody appears to have seen her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, the stakes are raised. Somebody is offering money – a lot of money – for information about Tasha’s whereabouts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tom and Emma know they have never been closer to finding the young girl. But they also recognise that she has never been closer to danger. Can they find her first? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; She can run – but for how long can she hide? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Praise for Rachel Abbott’s books &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Pure Genius: A Masterclass in the Perfect Thriller!!” – Love Books &lt;br /&gt;"Absorbing, complex and brilliantly planned, I loved this book. 10/10." Novelicious &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The characters are believable and the crimes credible. Contemporary issues, grief and desperation are well handled. The pace is good, the twists credible and it can easily be read as a stand alone. Enjoy." Crime Thriller Hound &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I was left speechless in the first chapter and couldn't put it down for hours. Rachel is amazing at building tension and keeping you turning page after page." &lt;i&gt; Crime Book Club &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Stranger Child was the PERFECT thriller. I couldn't get enough of this shocking story." &lt;i&gt; Bookaholic Confessions &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Ms. Abbott writes complex and yet very believable thrillers and this book was no exception. You will be on the edge of your seat constantly. 5 stars. A very strong thriller." &lt;i&gt; Books, Reviews, Etc. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Prose is taut, wholly believable locations and a full cast bursting with engaging characters." &lt;i&gt; Crime Fiction Lover &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I loved this book! What I loved the most about this book was the plot. There are a few 'curve balls' in this story, which definitely kept me on my toes. I really could not put this down." &lt;i&gt; Debra's Book Cafe &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Set against the opposing realities of harsh, crime-ridden gangs and cosy, well-off, Middle-England families, Abbott seamlessly weaves three separate narratives together into one barn-stormer of a thriller. ...a well-rounded, and fulfilling novel, that still manages to keep you guessing right to the very end." &lt;i&gt; If These Books Could Talk &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I have resented the intrusion of real people while my mind grappled with the events in Sleep Tight” &lt;i&gt; Cleo Loves Books &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Whenever the Unmumsy Mum shares a story about life with her two young boys, she is inundated with anecdotes from other mums who have had similar experiences. As she herself puts it: 'I have spent many an evening over the past year absolutely howling with laughter at all the comments and messages received via my blog and social media pages. The Facebook page, in particular, has become a place for mums and dads to share their hilarious stories about the reality of life with children. I was confident that there would be further undiscovered gems out there - hysterical things that children have said, embarrassing things that they have done - so I invited my followers to send their own tales to me. This is a collection of the best of those stories - enjoy!'&lt;br /&gt;This free ebook collection is released to celebrate publication of The Unmumsy Mum's book on 11th February 2016 and includes an exclusive preview of &lt;i&gt;The Unmumsy Mum&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>You love your family. They make you feel safe. You trust them. Or do you…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fifteen-year-old Billy Wilkinson goes missing in the middle of the night, his mother, Claire Wilkinson, blames herself. She's not the only one. There isn't a single member of Billy's family that doesn't feel guilty. But the Wilkinson’s are so used to keeping secrets from one another that it isn't until six months later, after an appeal for information goes horribly wrong, that the truth begins to surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is sure of two things – that Billy is still alive and that her friends and family had nothing to do with his disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother's instinct is never wrong. Or is it?</description>

  <description>Trinity follows the lives of three rich, beautiful and glamorous women who think that the bond of friendship between them will last for eternity. But life has an unpleasant way of upsetting their harmonious existence and making even the best of friends turn on each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gossip queen Anoushka Silvers must face up to the fact that she is the daughter her abusive father never wanted. Her relentless ambition to be top of her game and prove herself to her family means that she will stop at nothing to dish the dirt on the celebrity world to try and earn respect. But when her bitchy tongue gains her death threats and the unwanted attention of a stalker, it could be Anoushka who is making the headlines. Plus when the ultimate shocking glory-grabbing story means betraying one of her closest friends, will she choose her own professional gain over those she says she loves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For actress Evie Merchant, her childhood dreams of becoming the world’s hottest movie star are just about to come true. But a string of loveless, hurtful liaisons with lovers solely out to use her fame has made Evie uncertain about her future. And with Oscar day looming, Evie’s biggest prize of all could be torn from her by the revelation of a terrible secret from her past. Can she keep the fact that she sacrificed her own baby to follow her dreams hidden from the outside world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild child Regan Phoenix has never felt loved. She’s had to cope with her soap star mother’s disinterest all her life and has never known who her father is. A loveless childhood has made Regan search for quick-fix highs from drink, drugs and meaningless sex. But when the opportunity of starring in her own reality show comes along, Regan grabs it with both hands, hoping to put her trashy past behind her. But will worldwide fame in her own right finally make her mother notice her and help Regan get to the bottom of her real parentage? Or will she succumb to the temptations that life puts in front of her and blow her chances for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From fashionable London to glitzy Los Angeles and from the decadence of Venice to the sun-drenched beaches of Muscat, Trinity takes you on an unforgettable journey which proves that not everyone can end up living happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRAISE FOR TRINITY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sex and scandal abound in this full-throttle thrill-ride through the hidden lives of the mega-rich. Trinity sizzles with bitchery, bling and betrayal, and is the perfect accompaniment to your sunlounger this summer'&lt;br /&gt;VICTORIA FOX, author of Wicked Ambition, Temptation Island and Hollywood Sinners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Trinity is so much fun. A great summer bonkbuster'&lt;br /&gt;TASMINA PERRY, author of Private Lives, Kiss Heaven Goodbye, Perfect Strangers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Opening Trinity is like biting into a very indulgent, rich, rare chocolate, it's naughty but my word you enjoy every bite. Each chapter serves a delicious helping of glamour, secrets, and intrigue. It really is like reading into the secret life behind the glamorous exterior of starlets, the “well connected” and their families. I love the diverse backdrops of Hollywood, England, new money and reality TV. Each of the three main characters are so brilliantly bought to life and anyone who reads this story will know or identify with the different aspects of these fabulous women - so real and rounded to the point that I wonder if Nigel has drawn from life experience and knowledge. It's been a while since I have gasped as I come to the end of page or chapter in a book but this is exactly what I did many times throughout Trinity. I thoroughly blame Nigel May for my lack of sleep while delving into the lives of Anoushka, Evie and Regan. It’s also rare that a book can make you laugh out loud but Trinity did just this. I adore Nigel’s stream of conscious writing mixed with a wicked humour throughout every single page.'&lt;br /&gt;GENEVIEVE NI REAMOINN, TV Presenter and Journalist</description>

  <description>A shockingly original thriller - the launch title of Zaffre, the new fiction imprint of Bonnier Publishing Fiction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judith Rashleigh works as an assistant in a prestigious London auction house, but her dreams of breaking into the art world have been gradually dulled by the blunt forces of snobbery and corruption. To make ends meet she moonlights as a hostess in one of the West End's less salubrious bars - although her work there pales against her activities on nights off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Judith stumbles across a conspiracy at her auction house, she is fired before she can expose the fraud. In desperation, she accepts an offer from one of the bar's clients to accompany him to the French Riviera. But when an ill-advised attempt to slip him sedatives has momentous consequences, Judith finds herself fleeing for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now alone and in danger, all Judith has to rely on is her consummate ability to fake it amongst the rich and famous - and the inside track on the hugely lucrative art fraud that triggered her dismissal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the exotic palaces and yachts of Europe's seriously wealthy - plus graphic sex. With a heroine as wickedly perceptive as Amy Dunne and as dangerous as Lisbeth Salander, this marks the beginning of a sequence of novels that will have readers around the world on the edge of their seats and holding their breath.</description>

  <description>From international bestselling author Harriet Evans, an engrossing new novel about a woman who, on the eve of her eightieth birthday, decides to reveal a secret that may destroy her perfect family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Martha Winter decided to tear apart her family began like any other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Martha, a wife and mother of three, sits down one late summer’s morning to write out the invitations to her eightieth birthday celebration, she knows that what she is planning to reveal at the party could ruin the idyllic life she and her husband David have spent over fifty years building…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she has to let her family know what she and David have sacrificed. She can’t live a lie any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invitation goes out far and wide, calling her three children and their families back home to Winterfold, their rambling house in the heart of the English countryside. They are Bill, the doctor; Florence, the eccentric academic; and Daisy, the child who never fit in. As the story unfolds, each character reveals the secrets, joys, and tragedies they are wrestling with through the confines of the family. What will happen when Martha finally tells the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Secrets of Happiness&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary tale of sisterhood, from Lucy Diamond author of &lt;i&gt;The Beach Cafe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The best things in life . . . can be just around the corner&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel and Becca aren't real sisters, or so they say. They are stepsisters, living far apart, with little in common. Rachel is the successful one: happily married with three children and a big house, plus an impressive career. Artistic Becca, meanwhile, lurches from one dead-end job to another, shares a titchy flat, and has given up on love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two of them have lost touch, but when Rachel doesn't come home one night, Becca is called in to help. &lt;br /&gt;Once there, she quickly realizes that her stepsister's life is not so perfect after all: Rachel's handsome husband&lt;br /&gt;has moved out, her children are rebelling, and her glamorous career has taken a nosedive. Worst of all, &lt;br /&gt;nobody seems to have a clue where she might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Becca begins to untangle Rachel's secrets, she is forced to confront some uncomfortable truths about &lt;br /&gt;her own life, and the future seems uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes happiness can be found in the most unexpected places . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If there’s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it’s that she’s different.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mare Barrow’s blood is red—the color of common folk—but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince—the friend—who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electrifying next installment in the Red Queen series escalates the struggle between the growing rebel army and the blood-segregated world they’ve always known—and pits Mare against the darkness that has grown in her soul.</description>

  <description>The time has come for one winner to be crowned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she was chosen to compete in the Selection, America never dreamed she would find herself anywhere close to the crown—or to Prince Maxon's heart. But as the end of the competition approaches, and the threats outside the palace walls grow more vicious, America realizes just how much she stands to lose—and how hard she'll have to fight for the future she wants.</description>

  <description>The Selection began with thirty-five girls.&lt;br /&gt;Now with the group narrowed down to the six Elite, the competition to win Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever—and America is still struggling to decide where her heart truly lies. Is it with Maxon, who could make her life a fairy tale? Or with her first love, Aspen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America is desperate for more time. But the rest of the Elite know exactly what they want—and America's chance to choose is about to slip away.</description>

  <description>This is a world divided by blood - red or silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy the balance of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart...</description>

  <description>For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself—and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.</description>

  <description>A canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the "psychic" visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan's terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan's teenage stepson, doesn't help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Grownup,” originally appeared as “What Do You Do?” in George R. R. Martin’s Rogues anthology.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Tilly Bagshawe’s Swell Valley, where the scandal is in a class of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tatiana Flint-Hamilton’s gilded cage is torn away when her estranged father dies. As the beloved family estate slips through Tati’s fingers, the portraits of her ancestors look down disapprovingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Lord of the Manor is just as ruthless as Tati. The old-world status of Furlings is everything the wealthy, self-made Brett Cranley has ever wanted. Luckily his wife Angela is the perfect homemaker, happy to fall into line with whatever Brett desires. Along with her two children, Furlings soon becomes Angela’s lifeline, a place she can finally belong. And one she’s not going to give up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing everything has made Tati realise that her rightful inheritance is all that she now lives for… and she will do anything to get it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fate of Furlings lies in the hands of the villagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the Fittlescombe fireworks begin!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of number one bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Sleep Tight.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Dark Secret. One act of revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emma Joseph met her husband David, he was a man shattered by grief. His first wife had been killed outright when her car veered off the road. Just as tragically, their six-year-old daughter mysteriously vanished from the scene of the accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, six years later, Emma believes the painful years are behind them. She and David have built a new life together and have a beautiful baby son, Ollie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a stranger walks into their lives, and their world tilts on its axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma's life no longer feels secure. Does she know what really happened all those years ago? And why does she feel so frightened for herself and for her baby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a desperate Emma reaches out to her old friend DCI Tom Douglas for help, she puts all their lives in jeopardy. Before long, a web of deceit is revealed that shocks both Emma and Tom to the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They say you should never trust a stranger. Maybe they're right.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>How do you move on after losing the person you loved? How do you build a life worth living?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Louisa Clark is no longer just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life. After the transformative six months spent with Will Traynor, she is struggling without him. When an extraordinary accident forces Lou to return home to her family, she can’t help but feel she’s right back where she started.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her body heals, but Lou herself knows that she needs to be kick-started back to life. Which is how she ends up in a church basement with the members of the Moving On support group, who share insights, laughter, frustrations, and terrible cookies. They will also lead her to the strong, capable Sam Fielding—the paramedic, whose business is life and death, and the one man who might be able to understand her. Then a figure from Will’s past appears and hijacks all her plans, propelling her into a very different future. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Lou Clark, life after Will Traynor means learning to fall in love again, with all the risks that brings. But here Jojo Moyes gives us two families, as real as our own, whose joys and sorrows will touch you deeply, and where both changes and surprises await.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After You is quintessential Jojo Moyes—a novel that will make you laugh, cry, and rejoice at being back in the world she creates. Here she does what few novelists can do—revisits beloved characters and takes them to places neither they nor we ever expected.</description>

  <description>What are the odds that the stranger sitting next to you on a plane is destined to change your life? Especially when they appear to be your opposite in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's a life-long optimist, looking for her soul mate in every man she meets; he's a resolute cynic - cruel experience has taught him never to put his faith in anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People can surprise you. In the time it takes to fly from London to Chicago, each finds something in the other that they didn't even realise they needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their pasts are such that they can never make one another happy and it's when they get off the plane, that their true journey begins...</description>

  <description>A woman without a memory struggles to discover the truth about her past and her identity in this cerebral and dark thriller reminiscent of works by bestselling authors S.J. Watson and Ruth Ware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no memory of what happened but I was told I killed my son. And you believe what your loved ones, your doctor and the police tell you, don't you? My name is Emma Cartwright. Three years ago I was Susan Webster, and I murdered my twelve-week-old son Dylan. I was sent to Oakdale Psychiatric Institute for my crime, and four weeks ago I was released early on parole with a new identity, address, and a chance to rebuild my tattered life. This morning, I received an envelope addressed to Susan Webster. Inside it was a photograph of a toddler called Dylan. Now I am questioning everything I believe because if I have no memory of the event, how can I truly believe he's dead? If there was the smallest chance your son was alive, what would you do to get him back?</description>

  <description>Where Confidence is the New Black. &lt;br /&gt; Meet best friends Pixie, Ellie, Katie and Jane. Fed up with always struggling to lose weight, they ditch the scales and start a social club where size doesn't matter. Soon it's the most popular place to be - having fun instead of counting calories - and the women find their lives changing in ways they never imagined. &lt;br /&gt; But the club can't stop real life from mucking things up. &lt;br /&gt; Sharing offices in a taxidermist's garage with Pete the bear, together they've got to manage more than their new club - dodgy colleagues, a waste-of-space husband and sabotaged romance - while learning the most important lesson of all. In the Curvy Girls Club, confidence is the new black. &lt;br /&gt; "This is a delightful book of friendship, acceptance, and belonging for anyone who has ever wondered: "What if?""

  <description>Her marriage is all washed up. It's time for a clean start&amp;amp;#8230; &lt;br /&gt;Connie Diamond has always been her husband Jimmy's 'best girl' - or so she thought. But then she discovers that he's been playing away for the past twenty-four years, and that the chocolates she believed he bought her as a sign of his love were just a cover-up, and she is determined to get revenge.&lt;br /&gt; Along with Della Frostick, Jimmy's right-hand woman at his cleaning firm, Diamond Shine, Connie decides to destroy Jimmy's life from the inside. Together they will set up a rival business called Lady Muck, and along with the cleaning ladies who meet at the Sunflower Café, they'll make him wish he had never so much as looked at another woman. &lt;br /&gt; Then Connie meets the charming Brandon Locke, a master chocolatier, whose kind chocolate-brown eyes start to melt her soul. Can the ladies of the Sunflower Café help Connie scrub away the hurt? And can Brandon cure her affliction and make her smile again?</description>

  <description>Hannah, independent, headstrong, and determined not to follow in the footsteps of her bitterly divorced mother, has always avoided commitment. But one hot New York summer she meets Mark Reilly, a fellow Brit, and is swept up in a love affair that changes all her ideas about what marriage might mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, living in their elegant, expensive London townhouse and adored by her fantastically successful husband, she knows she was right to let down her guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mark does not return from a business trip to the U.S. and when the hours of waiting for him stretch into days, the foundations of Hannah's certainty begin to crack. Why do Mark's colleagues believe he has gone to Paris not America? Why is there no record of him at his hotel? And who is the mysterious woman who has been telephoning him over the last few weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah begins to dig into her husband's life, uncovering revelations that throw into doubt everything she has ever believed about him. As her investigation leads her away from their fairytale romance into a place of violence and fear she must decide whether the secrets Mark has been keeping are designed to protect him or protect her...</description>

  <description>You live together, laugh together, borrow her shoes and eyeliner – is there anything you can’t share with your sister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie’s younger sister Rose has it all. She’s beautiful, stylish and dates gorgeous, glamorous millionaires, while Ellie is quite happy watching TV on the sofa with her old mate Ben. But when Rose brings her new boyfriend home, it’s lust at first sight for Ellie. And although she knows it’s wrong, everything changes: she’ll do whatever it takes to get Oliver, even if it means abandoning her principles and turning a deaf ear to her friends. After all, would it be so wrong to take up running, put some highlights in her hair and make herself look a tiny, little bit more like Rose? But as Ellie follows in her sister’s stiletto-heeled footsteps, she realises that finding love could mean losing the most important thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Would Be Wrong to Steal My Sister’s Boyfriend... is a warm, witty whirlwind romance. If you’re a fan of Tracy Bloom, Pippa Wright and Mhairi McFarlane, you’ll love Sophie Ranald.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far would you go to hold on to the people you love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olivia Brookes calls the police to report that her husband and children are missing, she believes she will never see them again. She has reason to fear the worst; this isn’t the first tragedy that Olivia has experienced.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, two years later, Detective Chief Inspector Tom Douglas is called in to investigate this family again, but this time it’s Olivia who has disappeared. All the evidence suggests that she was here, in the family home, that morning. But her car is in the garage, and her purse is in her handbag – on the kitchen table.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The police want to issue a national appeal, but for some reason every single picture of this family has been removed from albums, from phones, from computers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then they find the blood…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Has the past caught up with Olivia?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep Tight&lt;/b&gt; – if you can. You never know who’s watching.</description>

  <description>One girl is fighting for her life. One village is struggling to hold tight to its secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young girl is knocked over and left for dead at the side of the road, the small community of Little Melham goes into shock. Why was Abbie out so late at night, and why wasn't she missed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Ellie Saunders, the truth about that night could put her marriage and even the safety of her children in jeopardy. She has to protect her family, no matter what the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former DCI Tom Douglas thought that Little Melham would offer a peaceful retreat from the daily trauma of his work for the Met. But as he is drawn into the web of deceit, his every instinct tells him that what happened to Abbie was more than a tragic accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one person knows the whole story - why Abbie was out that night, and who was driving the car. For that person, the accident spells disaster, and somebody has to pay.</description>

  <description>Every moment of Sir Hugo Fletcher’s life has been chronicled in the British press: his privileged upbringing, his high-profile charity work to end human trafficking—even his two marriages. But when the billionaire philanthropist is discovered murdered in his London home, tied naked to a bed, the scandal is only a shadow of the darkness lurking off-camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Fletcher returns from an Italian vacation to find her husband dead and her home under siege by paparazzi. Is she shocked? Yes. But is she distraught? Not exactly. Especially when Chief Inspector Tom Douglas reveals his suspicions that Hugo’s killer is female. Laura always knew she wasn’t the only woman in Hugo’s life. And she knows she wasn’t the only one with a motive to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeper Douglas digs, the more sordid details about Hugo Fletcher he uncovers. And yet nothing compares to the secret Laura guards, a secret that could bring the guilty to justice—or destroy an innocent life forever.</description>

  <description>BE SURE YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Flynn is untouchable in a world of power, money and violence. He fights for what he wants and he takes it, whatever the cost. He learns the rules of the Life from the best and when his mentor, legendary Face Patrick Costello, is taken out, no one questions that Michael Flynn is his natural successor. For Michael, loyalty - and crime - pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael rises to heights beyond anything the criminal underworld has seen. He owns everyone and he rules his empire with an even but fierce hand. No one would dare challenge him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the unthinkable happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Michael Flynn is not so untouchable after all, and he must learn that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE CAN BE NO FORGIVENESS OF SINS.</description>

  <description>Doesn't Everyone Have a Secret? is a romantic comedy about three very different people, each with a secret, whose lives collide in unexpected ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steph is a harassed mum who's considering an affair with her children's sexy headmaster. Penny is trying to deal with a crush on her boss, OCD and a sad secret from her childhood. And Mike is a vicar who is being blackmailed for his secret, although it's not all that it seems! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, all three are being watched over by their own guardian angels, who try to push them in the right direction and help move their lives along - but not always successfully ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't Everyone Have a Secret? is genuinely laugh out loud funny, but also deals in a sensitive way with serious problems that any of us could face in life. Sue Shepherd's debut novel is bold, it doesn't pull any punches, and it has bucket loads of heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Of&lt;i&gt; Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice" of Kinnakee, Kansas. She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. The earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of human hosts while leaving their bodies intact. Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, didn't expect to find its former tenant refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of Jared, a human who still lives in hiding, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she's never met. Reluctant allies, Wanderer and Melanie set off to search for the man they both love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also see: Alternate Cover Editions for this ISBN [ACE] &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>What if you had said yes? The moments that change everything... One Day meets Sliding Doors in this outstanding debut that is causing a buzz across the publishing world&lt;br /&gt;Some moments can change your life for ever. Have you ever wondered, what if...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man is walking down a country lane. A woman, cycling towards him, swerves to avoid a dog. On that moment, their future hinges. There are three possible outcomes, three small decisions that could determine the rest of their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva and Jim are nineteen and students at Cambridge when their paths first cross in 1958. And then there is David, Eva's then-lover, an ambitious actor who loves Eva deeply. The Versions of Us follows the three different courses their lives could take following this first meeting. Lives filled with love, betrayal, ambition but through it all is a deep connection that endures whatever fate might throw at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Versions of Us explores the idea that there are moments when our lives might have turned out differently, the tiny factors or decisions that could determine our fate, and the precarious nature of the foundations upon which we build our lives. It is also a story about the nature of love and how it grows, changes and evolves as we go through the vagaries of life.</description>

      <![CDATA[I was hooked on this book! 3 different versions of the story of Eva &amp; Jim's life, none of which are perfect and always interlinked. Really good read! I can't decide which version of the story I liked the best! <br /><br />Without too many spoilers . . . Version 1 is what I was rooting for from the start...]]>

      <![CDATA[I'm not sure if I enjoyed this book or not. I read it because I knew there was a twist at the end and knew I wanted to find out what it was. I didn't think the twist would be what it turned out to be. I think that a small part of the twist made it less enjoyable and if I was Lockhart I would have...]]>

  <description>Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: she must return to her tiny hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming.</description>

      <![CDATA[I don't read psychological thrillers that often, maybe once or twice a year, but this book completely captivated me. I couldn't put it down.
