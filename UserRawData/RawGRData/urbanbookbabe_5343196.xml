  <description>She's got an uncanny knack for winning at slots, but her home-sweet-home is Bad-Ass Bert's Biker Saloon. She'd love to go deep undercover with an irresistibly hot cop, but he's got baggage as big as his biceps. She's survived a mysterious tragedy, but Mojo Sheepshanks hasn't quite figured out who she really is or how to get on with her life. And now the wisecracking Mojo is seeing ghosts--the real, ectoplasmic kind--and turning up baffling clues to her real identity. Suddenly a wealthy man is claiming to be her long-lost uncle... and she's being shadowed by an ex-con brother with a talent for killer mind games. As Mojo races to finally uncover the facts, she'll need all her savvy and strange new talent to keep someone from burying her--and the truth--for keeps.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young female reporter uncovers a dark web of political corruption. A discovery so big the conspirators will do anything to keep it a secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an Armani-clad body turns up in a shallow forest grave, Nichelle Clarke is the first reporter on the scene. She soon discovers the victim is a tobacco lobbyist with powerful connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local politicians are pushing for a quick arrest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nichelle thinks they seem nervous. Even more so after a second victim is found dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nichelle's search for the killer soon uncovers a jaw-dropping trail of malfeasance and debauchery that stretches all the way to Washington, D.C. It's the kind of story that can make a crime reporter's career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the power players at the center of this conspiracy have everything to lose, and as Nichelle's quest for the truth nears its end, she lands squarely in the crosshairs of the killer. Can her wits alone can get her out alive, or will these secrets stay buried for good?</description>

  <description>When Christopher Thomas, a curator at San Francisco's Museum of Fine Arts, is murdered and his decaying body is found in an iron maiden in Berlin, his wife Rosemary Thomas is the prime suspect. Long suffering under Christopher's unfaithful ways, Rosemary is tried, convicted and executed. &lt;br /&gt; Ten years later, Jon Nunn, the detective who cracked the case, becomes convinced that the wrong person was put to death. Along with financier Tony Olsen, he plans to gather everyone who was there the night Christopher died and finally uncover the truth about what happened that fateful evening. &lt;br /&gt; Could it have been the ne'er do well brother Peter Hausen, interested in his sister's trust fund having got through his own; the curatorial assistant Justine Olengard, used and betrayed by Christopher; the artist Belle who turned down his advances only to see her career suffer a setback; or someone else all together? No Rest for the Dead is a thrilling, page-turning accomplishment that only the very best thriller writers could achieve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nevada Frida Baylor and Connor Ander Rogan cordially invite you to join their wedding celebration. Summoning, weather manipulation, and other magical activities strictly forbidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catalina Baylor is looking forward to wearing her maid of honor dress and watching her older sister walk down the aisle. Then the wedding planner gets escorted off the premises, the bride’s priceless tiara disappears, and Rogan's extensive family overruns his mother’s home. Someone is cheating, someone is lying, and someone is plotting murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this wedding happen, Catalina will have to do the thing she fears most: use her magic. But she’s a Baylor and there’s nothing she wouldn't do for her sister's happiness. Nevada will have her fairy tale wedding, even if Catalina has to tear the mansion apart brick by brick to get it done.</description>

  <description>Just when Nevada Baylor has finally come to accept the depths of her magical powers, she also realizes she’s fallen in love. Connor “Mad” Rogan is in many ways her equal when it comes to magic, but she’s completely out of her elements when it comes to her feelings for him. To make matters more complicated, an old flame comes back into Rogan’s life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan knows there’s nothing between him and his ex-fiance, Rynda Sherwood. But as Nevada begins to learn more about her past, her power, and her potential future, he knows she will be faced with choices she never dreamed of and the promise of a life spent without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nevada and Rogan race to discover the whereabouts of Rynda’s kidnapped husband and are forced to confront Nevada’s grandmother, who may or may not have evil motives, these two people must decide if they can trust in each other or allow everything to go up in smoke.</description>

  <description>Nevada Baylor has a unique and secret skill—she &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; when people are lying—and she's used that magic (along with plain, hard work) to keep her colorful and close-knit family's detective agency afloat. But her new case pits her against the shadowy forces that almost destroyed the city of Houston once before, bringing Nevada back into contact with Connor "Mad" Rogan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan is a billionaire Prime—the highest rank of magic user—and as unreadable as ever, despite Nevada’s “talent.” But there’s no hiding the sparks between them. Now that the stakes are even higher, both professionally and personally, and their foes are unimaginably powerful, Rogan and Nevada will find that nothing burns like ice …</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sleeping with the staff wasn't part of the plan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensible, capable, and ruthlessly efficient, Hannah Kabbah is the perfect nanny… until a colossal mistake destroys her career and shatters her reputation. These days, no-one in town will hire her—except Nathaniel Davis, a brooding widower with a smile like sin and two kids he can’t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prim and proper Hannah is supposed to make Nate’s life easier, but the more time he spends around his live-in nanny, the more she makes things… &lt;i&gt;hard.&lt;/i&gt; He can’t take advantage of her vulnerable position, but he can’t deny the truth, either: with every look, every smile, every midnight meeting, Nate’s untouchable employee is stealing his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, she doesn’t want to keep it. Forbidden love isn’t high on Hannah’s to-do list, and trust isn’t one of her strengths. When dark secrets threaten to destroy their bond, Nate’s forced to start playing dirty. Because this reformed bad boy will break every rule to finally claim his woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be aware: this book contains depictions of depression and anxiety that could trigger certain audiences.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She wants a fake relationship. He needs something real.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing Rae can’t stand, it’s pity. She’s forty, frazzled, and fed up—so attending an awards ceremony &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt; while her ex swans about with his new wife? Not an option. To avoid total humiliation, Rae needs a date of her own. And her young, hot-as-hell new best friend is the perfect candidate…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach Davis, king of casual hookups, has a secret: the notorious womaniser craves emotional connection, and anonymous encounters leave him feeling hollow. After years of performance, Zach’s desperate to be himself. So why does he agree to play Rae’s fake boyfriend? And why does it feel so easy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the line between pretence and desire blurs, Zach’s forced to face an unexpected truth: there’s nothing phoney about his need for Rae. But the jaded divorcée’s been hurt by playboy men before. Can a weekend of faking it prove that Zach’s for real?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's the town pariah. He doesn't give a damn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Ruth Kabbah’s world, comic books are king, silence is golden, and human contact is a pesky distraction. She doesn’t like people, which works out just fine, because the people in this small town don’t like her. The exception to that rule? Evan Miller, her way-too-charming next-door neighbour…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-military man Evan is all tattooed muscle on the outside—and a big, cuddly teddy bear beneath. He’s used to coaxing prickly people from their shells, but he’s never met a woman quite like Ruth. Blunt, sarcastic, and secretly sad, she’s his exact opposite. She’s also his deepest desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Evan’s steady patience and smouldering smiles are melting Ruth’s reserve. But when small-town gossip from her past begins to poison her future, she’s forced to make a choice. Should she trust Evan completely? Or is her heart safest alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be aware: this book contains mentions of intimate partner violence that could trigger certain audiences. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Coulter continues the suspense-filled series she began with The Cove (1996) and The Maze (1997), even bringing in some of the same characters. Her latest is set in the Colorado mountains, where Judge Ramsey Hunt has fled to recuperate after being forced to shoot a man during a melee in his courtroom. But his dream of peace and quiet is shattered when he discovers an unconscious, beaten, and sexually abused little girl who is too traumatized to speak. Reluctant to subject her to any more terror, Ramsey refrains from going to the authorities and cares for her himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once again, violence intrudes, first when two gunmen attempt to take the girl, and then when her mother, Molly, appears, ready to kill the man she believes is the kidnapper. Miraculously, Emma regains her voice in the nick of time, so Molly and Ramsey join forces and attempt to solve the mystery of her abduction. Emma is a target for any of a number of reasons--her father is a famous rock star with a gambling problem, and her grandfather is a Chicago Mob boss--and Coulter, who doesn't stint on humor or romance, keeps readers guessing.</description>

  <description>The predator becomes the prey in the newest thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling series featuring homicide detective Eve Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She calls herself Lady Justice. And once she has chosen a man as her target, she turns herself into a tall blonde or a curvaceous redhead, makes herself as alluring and seductive as possible to them. Once they are in her grasp, they are powerless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first victim is wealthy businessman Nigel McEnroy. His company’s human resources department has already paid out settlements to a couple of his young victims—but they don’t know that his crimes go far beyond workplace harassment. Lady Justice knows. And in one shocking night of brutality, she makes him pay a much steeper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Eve Dallas and her husband, Roarke, are combing through the evidence of McEnroy’s secret life. His compulsive need to record his misdeeds provides them with a wide range of suspects, but the true identity of Lady Justice remains elusive. It’s a challenging case, made even more difficult by McEnroy’s widow, who reacts to the investigation with fury, denial, and threats. Meanwhile, Lady Justice’s criminal crusade is escalating rapidly, and if Eve can’t stop this vigilante, there’s no telling how much blood may be spilled…</description>

  <description>A man undercover must reveal the truth in the swamps in the continuation of USA TODAY bestselling author Jana DeLeon's Mystere Parish: Family Inheritance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day on the job and contractor Zach Sargent is ready to believe the dilapidated old LeBeau mansion is haunted. Some intruder -- earthly or not -- is threatening the youngest LeBeau sister, back to claim her inheritance. And though Danae keeps her distance from the sexy hired hand, he falls for her in a heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Danae, Zach has come back to Calais in need of answers to troubling questions about the LeBeau family past. But Danae must never know who he really is and he can't let his attraction to her stop his search…or else a decades-old evil will claim a new victim.</description>

  <description>Certain death awaits any outsider who enters Cache, a mythical city said to disappear when intruders threaten. But P.I. Max Duhon won't let the Cajun superstition stop him from going there. He'll do anything to help sexy Colette Guidry and close this missing person's case, even admit how attracted he is to his client. But as their investigation deepens, Max finds himself protecting Colette from the inexplicable terrors of the bayou. This includes the specter taunting them with voodoo…and a shotgun. It seems they may have come too close to Cache and its eerie secrets—and dangerously close to each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Something is out there…watching…waiting&lt;/i&gt;It could be a mythical creature wreaking havoc on a Mystere hotel…or a malicious vandal. It's detective Tanner LeDoux's first case and—much to his chagrin—the hotel belongs to Josie Bettencourt, once the most popular girl in town and his unrequited love. A woman who now doesn't even recognize him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie's poor memory is Tanner's luck, however. He has a chance to be the strong, sexy hero who protects her and her hotel from mounting danger. Tanner's no believer in the old ways, but one stormy night, he sees something horrific he can't explain. And he knows, without a doubt, whatever lurks in Honey Island Swamp means to keep Josie from him forever!</description>

At one time, he'd been forced to leave her brokenhearted. And now , dangerously close to the truth, he'll do anything to protect her from the evil that surrounds them—an evil that might hold the key to sending a little girl home.…</description>

  <description>In the debut of a delightful cozy mystery series, Sarah Fox introduces a charming new heroine who finds herself in a sticky situation: stacking pancakes, pouring coffee, and investigating murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Marley McKinney’s aging cousin, Jimmy, is hospitalized with pneumonia, she agrees to help run his pancake house while he recovers. With its rustic interior and syrupy scent, the Flip Side Pancake House is just as she pictured it—and the surly chef is a wizard with crêpes. Marley expects to spend a leisurely week or two in Wildwood Cove, the quaint, coastal community where she used to spend her summers, but then Cousin Jimmy is found murdered, sprawled on the rocks beneath a nearby cliff.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After she stumbles across evidence of stolen goods in Jimmy’s workshop, Marley is determined to find out what’s really going on in the not-so-quiet town of Wildwood Cove. With help from her childhood crush and her adopted cat, Flapjack, Marley sinks her teeth into the investigation. But if she’s not careful, she’s going to get burned by a killer who’s only interested in serving up trouble.</description>

  <description>No one in Sinful liked Pansy Arceneaux, but who hated her enough to kill her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When aspiring actress Pansy Arceneaux returns to Sinful, Louisiana to head up the beauty pageant portion of the Summer Festival, CIA assassin Fortune Redding knows she’s in for trouble. Her undercover identity as a former beauty queen makes Fortune the perfect choice to chair the event with Pansy, but Pansy’s abrasive personality makes it impossible to get through a single rehearsal without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Pansy turns up dead, Fortune is the prime suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with only her wits and two conniving seniors referred to locally as The Geritol Mafia, Fortune launches an investigation to find the real killer before her cover is blown.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Love. Lies. Murder. A lot can happen... COME SUNDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodine Longbow loves to rise with the dawn. As the manager of her family's resort in Western Montana, there just aren't enough hours in the day - for life, for work, for loved ones. She certainly doesn't have time for love, not even in the gorgeous shape of her childhood crush Callen Skinner, all grown up and returned to the ranch. Then again, maybe Callen can change her mind, given time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a young woman's body is discovered on resort land, everything changes. Callen falls under the suspicion of a deputy sheriff with a grudge. And for Bodine's family, the murder is a shocking reminder of an old loss. Twenty-five years ago, Bodine's Aunt Alice vanished, never to be heard of again. Could this new tragedy be connected to Alice's mysterious disappearance? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As events take a dramatic and deadly turn, Bodine and Callen must race to uncover the truth - before the sun sets on their future together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For both Zane and Darby, their small town roots hold a terrible secret. Now, decades later, they've come together to build a new life. But will the past set them free or pull them under?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane Bigelow grew up in a beautiful, perfectly kept house in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Strangers―and even Zane’s own aunt across the lake―see his parents as a successful surgeon and his stylish wife, making appearances at their children’s ballet recitals and baseball games. Only Zane and his sister know the truth, until one brutal night finally reveals cracks in the facade, and Zane escapes for college without a thought of looking back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Zane returns to his hometown determined to reconnect with the place and people that mean so much to him, despite the painful memories. As he resumes life in the colorful town, he meets a gifted landscape artist named Darby, who is on the run from ghosts of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they will have to teach each other what it means to face the past, and stand up for the ones they love.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jana DeLeon, a new installment in her bestselling Miss Fortune series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s a little arson between friends? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Undercover CIA agent Fortune Redding spent her first three weeks in Sinful, Louisiana dodging insults, makeup advice, guard dogs, bullets, and Deputy Carter LeBlanc, both professionally and personally. But just when she thinks things are going to settle down in the small bayou town, someone sets her friend Ally’s house on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carter, who’d just started pursuing Fortune on a personal basis, goes back into cop mode and admonishes her to stay out of his investigation. This time, he swears he won’t issue any warning before arresting her. But with her friend’s safety hanging in the balance, Fortune can’t resist taking matters into her own hands and calls on her partners in crime fighting, Ida Belle and Gertie, to help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a mission for Swamp Team 3. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jana DeLeon, the third book in the Miss Fortune Mystery series.&lt;br /&gt;When only a crack shot will do…&lt;br /&gt;In the two weeks CIA assassin Fortune Redding has been hiding in Sinful, Louisiana, she’s been harassed, poisoned, and shot at…and that was the easy part. But now, she’s about to face her biggest challenge since setting foot in the tiny bayou town.&lt;br /&gt;When mayoral candidate Ted Williams is murdered, everyone is surprised. Ted was a blowhole and a Yankee, but those usually weren’t good reasons to kill someone. When Sinful Ladies Society leader Ida Belle becomes the lead suspect in the crime, Fortune knows she’s got to solve a murder and save one of the only friends she’s ever had. &lt;br /&gt;But as the investigation begins, more and more secrets surface, and Fortune realizes that sometimes nothing is as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Jana DeLeon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“DeLeon is excellent at weaving comedy, suspense and spicy romance into one compelling story.” – RT Book Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know where she comes up with this funny stuff, but I can’t wait to read the next book…” – Night Owl Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Jana DeLeon has a breezy style with enough of a comic touch to leave you smiling.” – The Romance Reader&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Son of a gun, we’re having fun in the bayou!” – Fresh Fiction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The quirky characters keep the action moving…” – Barbara Vey, Publisher’s Weekly Blogger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about Jana and her books visit her at these places:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://janadeleon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://janadeleon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/janadeleonauthor" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://facebook.com/janadeleonauthor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@JanaDeLeon</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The sixth in the Millennium series featuring THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What will you do now?"&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;I shall be the hunter and not the hunted&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl with the dragon tattoo is finally ready to confront her nemesis, the only woman who is evidently and in many ways her match. Salander will not wait to be hunted. When she strikes it will be a double blow: vengeance for recent atrocities, and the settling of lifelong scores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months now Salander has been closing in on her target. She has moved from Stockholm, her hair is newly styled, her piercings are gone. She could pass for any other businesswoman. But not all businesswomen have a Beretta Cheetah beneath their jacket. They do not wield the lethal power of a hacker's genius. They do not carry scars and tattoos to remind them that they have survived the unsurvivable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new episode in David Lagercrantz's acclaimed, internationally bestselling continuation of Stieg Larsson's Dragon Tattoo series is a thrilling ride that scales the heights of Everest and plunges the depths of Russian troll factories. It begins with the discovery of Mikael Blomkvist's number at &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt; magazine in the pocket of an unidentified homeless man who died with the name of a government minister on his lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blomkvist, at extreme risk to himself, tracks down his old friend and will protect her as far as he can. But he is powerless to crush her enemies on his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for Lisbeth Salander, the personal is always political - and deadly.</description>

  <description>In Fern Michaels's extraordinary, inspiring &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, an overweight woman sets out to improve her life by losing fifty-five pounds -- and ends up changing much more than her dress size! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rosie Gardener fell under the spell of handsome Kent Bliss, and not even her best friend Vickie could persuade her that her fiancé was a two-timing cad. Now it's her third wedding anniversary, and Rosie, fed up with Kent's mistreatment, realizes her estranged best friend was right. But the day after kicking Kent out and beginning a diet and exercise regime, Rosie experiences another life-changing event: she wins $302 million in the Wonderball lottery. Now with Kent lurking in the shadows to claim a share of her money, Rosie needs her friends more than ever. As she works out under the eye of sexy personal trainer Jack Silver, a stronger new Rosie emerges -- a woman who wants to learn to trust love once again. Can she keep her vow not to be stopped by Kent's bitterness and her own self-doubts and jump into life with a passion she didn't know she possessed?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Buried secrets and past betrayals, old friendships and new beginnings are at the heart of this rich, compelling bestseller from Fern Michaels, one of today's most popular novelists.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years after a childhood accident left a permanent shadow over her life, Cady Jordan has returned to her Pennsylvania hometown. Her beloved grandmother Lola, a retired movie star, needs Cady's care—but soon after arriving at Lola's lavish estate, it's clear that the colorful actress will be Cady's mentor to living life to the fullest. Cady wants nothing more than to come out of her shell, but to do so means resurrecting her lost memories of the day when a foolish stunt ended with a young bully's death and Cady's serious injury—a tragedy for which her friends held Cady responsible. They're adults now—a lawyer, a businessman, a stay-at-home mom. And a police chief: Boomer Ward, whose flaring attraction works on Cady's guarded heart. Now, Cady must determine who can be trusted as she draws closer to Boomer and confronts those who wish she'd never returned. Old wounds may be healed, but can Cady close a door on her heartache and embrace a bright new life?</description>

  <description>It was a hell of a longshot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CIA Assassin Fortune Redding is about to undertake her most difficult mission ever--in Sinful, Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a leak at the CIA and a price on her head by one of the world's largest arms dealers, Fortune has to go off grid, but she never expected to be this far out of her element. Posing as a former beauty queen turned librarian in a small, bayou town seems worse than death to Fortune, but she's determined to fly below the radar until her boss finds the leak and puts the arms dealer out of play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, she hasn't even unpacked a suitcase before her newly-inherited dog digs up a human bone in her backyard. Thrust into the middle of a bayou murder mystery, Fortune teams up with a couple of seemingly-sweet old ladies whose looks completely belie their hold on the little town. To top things off, the handsome local deputy is asking her too many questions. If she's not careful, this investigation may blow her cover and get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with her considerable skills and a group of old ladies referred to by locals as The Geritol Mafia, Fortune has no choice but to solve the murder before it's too late.</description>

  <description>Now best known for her &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling Sookie Stackhouse novels, Charlaine Harris garnered an unusual degree of acclaim with her first novel -- the story of a murder that embroils a small-town reporter in a mystery that hits close to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Linton came home to Lowfield, Mississippi convinced that the untimely deaths of her parents in a car accident was no accident -- but nobody believed her. So she stayed, taking a job at the local paper, to try to both convince the sheriff that she was right-and maybe convince herself she was wrong. After all, her father had been the town doctor, loved (she always thought) by all. To think he was killed was to think that one of her friends or neighbors has harbored some deep resentment toward him. Then she finds the dead body of the women who had been her father's nurse for many years. Obviously murdered. Now Catherine knows that she was not wrong about her parent's death. Someone in Lowfield has a terrible secret, a secret worth killing for. Not once, not twice, but -- when another body is found -- three times. And the killer won't hesitate to add more victims to the list, as Catherine gets closer and closer to the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing the first novel in the pulse-pounding Sacramento series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Rose.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a serial killer on the loose, preying on vulnerable women. The only identifiable mark the killer leaves are letters--sometimes one, sometimes two--all carved into the torsos of his victims. Together they spell "Sydney."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he grabs Daisy Dawson, he believes he has found his next victim. But despite her small stature, she fights back with an expertise that quickly frees her. Before fleeing the scene, Daisy also manages to grab what proves to be crucial evidence: a necklace from around the killer's neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The necklace is more than a trivial item--it is a link to a cold case that Special Agent Gideon Reynolds has been tracking for seventeen years. With Daisy's help, Gideon finally has the opportunity to get closer to the truth than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they might not get the chance, as the serial killer has a new target: Gideon and Daisy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the next “devilish page-turner” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.A. Jance, Ali Reynolds learns that no good deed goes unpunished.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ten years after the abrupt end of her high-profile broadcasting career, Ali Reynolds has made a good life for herself in her hometown of Sedona, Arizona. She has a new house, a new husband, and a flourishing cybersecurity company called High Noon Enterprises, where her team of veritable technological wizards hunts down criminals one case at a time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the death of an old friend brings Ali back to the last story she ever reported: a feel-good human interest piece about a young man in need of a kidney to save his life, which quickly spiraled into a medical mismanagement scandal that landed a prestigious local doctor in prison for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Years may have passed, but Dr. Edward Gilchrist has not forgotten those responsible for his downfall—certainly not Ali Reynolds, who exposed his dirty deeds to the world. Life without parole won’t stop him from getting his revenge. Tattooed on his arm are the initials of those who put him behind bars, and he won’t stop until every person on that Annihilation List is dead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this gripping suspense novel from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author praised for her “inimitable, take-no-prisoners style” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;), Ali Reynolds and her team race against the clock to stop this ruthless killer—before her own name is crossed out for good.</description>

  <description>Did she once have a sister? Has her mother lied all these years? Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a painful divorce, Maisey Lazarow returns to Fairham, the small island off the North Carolina coast where she grew up. She goes there to heal—and to help her brother, Keith, a deeply troubled man who's asked her to come home. But she refuses to stay in the family house. The last person she wants to see is the wealthy, controlling mother she escaped years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, she finds herself living next door to someone else she'd prefer to avoid—Rafe Romero, the wild, reckless boy to whom she lost her virginity at sixteen. He's back on the island, and to her surprise, he's raising a young daughter alone. Maisey's still attracted to him, but her heart's too broken to risk… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then something even more disturbing happens. She discovers a box of photographs that evoke distant memories of a little girl, a child Keith remembers, too. Maisey believes the girl must've been their sister, but their mother claims there was no sister. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maisey's convinced that child existed. So where is she now?</description>

  <description>They've been best friends since seventh grade. But this summer, on the threshold of thirty, four women are going to need each other more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie has sworn off romance. Yet deep down, she's still looking for Mr. Forever. A long-haired biker doesn't figure into her plans, so where's the harm in touring the back roads of Sonoma on a Harley with Walt Arneson?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie married her high school sweetheart—who can get her pregnant with a mere glance—too young and now wonders how her life became all about leaky faucets and checkbook balances. Maybe love isn't enough to sustain the hottest couple in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty's firefighter husband has forgotten all about romance, and an old flame begins to look mighty tempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth, a doctor trapped in a body that's betrayed her yet again, is becoming a difficult patient and a secretive friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life can change in an instant…or a summer. And having friends to lean on can only up the chances of happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For romance writer Roxy St. James, living in Nocturne Falls also means a fresh start. And as soon as her unbearable ex signs the divorce papers, that new beginning will be a reality. Unfortunately, her ex doesn’t seem ready to let her go and the subtle threats he’s been making leave her no choice but to confide in her oh-so-handsome neighbor, who just happens to be a deputy with the sheriff’s department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Officer Alex Cruz isn’t just the law. He’s also a panther shifter, a secret he’s sworn to keep (along with the truth about Nocturne Falls) from the very foxy Roxy. Humans aren’t supposed to know the town is filled with supernaturals. Then she starts seeing things she shouldn’t and thinks she’s losing her mind. His attraction—and concern—for her wars with the promise he’s made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will his truth be more than she can handle? Or will it cause her to write him out of her life?</description>

  <description>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Ellingham isn’t known for being a happy vampire. And when his long estranged wife comes to town expecting to pick up where they left off, things take a sharp turn toward cranky. Sure he’s been protecting her for centuries, but her assumption that he’s still available (he is) rankles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His answer is to hire a woman to play his fiancée. The lucky victim is Tessa Blythe, sister of one of the town’s deputies, librarian in need of a job and, oh yes, reluctant Valkyrie. Playing along with Sebastian is all about the end game for her, the position of Dean of Library Studies at the local private academy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When unexpected sparks fly between them, they agree to mutually deny the attraction. Fate, however, has other plans…</description>

  <description>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pandora Williams is Nocturne Falls’ most successful real estate agent. And least successful witch. Her magic never has the intended outcome, but she’s learned to live with that. Mostly. Yes, it sucks, but what can she do? Then a hot new neighbor shows up and suddenly her magic works. Very cool, but very suspect. Especially since he’s a total non-believer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cole Van Zant likes practicality and absolutes. Things he can see and touch. So not magic. But when his teenage daughter insists she’s a witch—and they’re now living in a town that celebrates Halloween every day—he needs help. Of the witchy variety. Thankfully, his sexy neighbor buys into all that hocus pocus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enlisting her help seems like a great idea until spending time together reveals a supernatural surprise about who Cole really is. A secret even he didn’t know. Could Pandora and Cole really be meant for one another or is their attraction too much to believe? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. &lt;/b&gt; The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa Iscove, fae jeweler, has her first stalker. Really, he’s just one of her lovesick customers. The ring she crafted to help him find new love has backfired, making Willa the object of his affections. In a bid to rid herself of her amorous client, Willa makes a wish in the Nocturne Falls fountain using the piece of opal in her pocket and in doing so, unknowingly conscripts as her guardian the sexy gargoyle on duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Army Ranger and gargoyle Nick Hardwin has some serious suspicions about the pretty fae who just invoked the ancient pact for protection. Her kind have been at odds with his kind for ages. Now she wants his help? He’s determined to figure out what she’s up to. Which won’t be a hardship considering how much fun she is to be around. And kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then her stalker turns out to be the tip of the iceberg and things go really wrong, really fast. When Nick and Willa are both kidnapped, Willa is forced to make a hard decision. The life of her family or the freedom of the man she’s fallen for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. &lt;/b&gt; The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting arrested wasn’t on werewolf Ivy Kincaid’s agenda when she arrived in Nocturne Falls, but her life rarely goes according to plan. The upside of spending the night in the local lock-up is finding a hotel room is no longer a worry...but the downside is the man she’s come to marry will get his first impression of her behind bars. Not exactly the way Ivy was hoping to meet her pack's sworn enemy...aka her fiancé. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheriff (and werewolf) Hank Merrow is the alpha's heir. Everything he's ever done, from becoming an Army Ranger to serving in law enforcement, has been in preparation for the day he’ll take over. Getting married to cement a shaky truce is no different. Hank will do his duty, even if it means shackling himself to a woman he has no intention of liking, let alone loving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ivy is nothing like Hank expected. As feisty as she is beautiful, she's as determined as he is to make a go of marriage for the sake of peace between their packs. The trouble is, Ivy has secrets that could destroy everything Hank holds dear...including his newfound love for her.</description>

  <description>The emotional story of a young woman's journey as she leaves behind all the things she thought she wanted only to discover who she really is. #1 New York Times bestselling author ROBYN CARR explores the challenges facing women today as they are valued for what's on the outside rather than the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Chaise is proud of her life. Coming from nothing, she's used her beauty to her advantage and is swept up in a glamorous world of wealth and privilege as the mistress of a high-flying businessman. But when she walks in on a violent scene in their Las Vegas hotel room, Jennifer knows she can no longer ignore the truth about her boyfriend and she flees. Desperate to escape the men searching for her, she invents a whole new persona—with a new look and a new name—as she hides out in a small Nevada town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working as a waitress in the local diner, she finds a mentor in Louise, a retired professor who takes her in. As Jennifer begins to embrace a new life, she realizes how much was missing from her old one: a sense of community and purpose… But it's not easy to simply disappear. Her neighbor Alex is a cop, and while he's friendly enough, he may also suspect that Jennifer is not what she seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although she is under constant threat of being discovered, Jennifer is surprised to realize that, for the first time, she's genuinely happy. Suddenly this real world is all she wants. But will it be enough when her past catches up with her?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town where Halloween is celebrated 365 days a year. &lt;/b&gt; The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing her maybe-mobster boss murder a guy, Delaney James assumes a new identity and pretends to be a mail order bride. What she doesn't know is her groom to be is a 400-year-old vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Ellingham has only agreed to the set up to make his overbearing grandmother happy. His past means love is no longer an option. Except he never counted on Delaney and falling in love for real.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad both of them are keeping some mighty big secrets...</description>

  <description>L'arte tutta femminile di accettare il passato così da rafforzare, attraverso il perdono e l'amore, gli indissolubili legami familiari.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meg, a fronte di una novità capace di sconvolgerle l'esistenza, decide di riunire le donne della sua vita nella casa sul lago in cui la sua famiglia ha trascorso giorni felici fino a quando il drammatico incidente che ha causato la scomparsa di Bunny, la sua sorellina minore, non ha cambiato drasticamente le cose... &lt;br /&gt;Sorelle, zie e cugine oggi fanno quotidianamente i conti con realtà più complicate di quelle che si sarebbero immaginate durante le estati della loro infanzia. Ma, richiamate dal forte legame di sangue che le unisce, decidono di riprendere in mano il loro passato con l'aiuto di alcuni vecchi album di fotografie e di rinascere dalle proprie ceneri come fanno le fenici. &lt;br /&gt;I ricordi riaffiorano e, insieme a questi, anche dei terribili segreti in grado di cancellare per sempre l'affetto che le tiene unite oppure, perché no, renderlo ancora più forte.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A movie deal for the Devil’s autobiography slash romance? Priceless.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should choose George Clooney to play me in the movie… No. Too gray. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As much as I can’t see anyone playing me but me, I have far more important issues on my agenda—like finding the woman who stole my soul. Well, not exactly stole… I might have made the switch and taken hers, but the Siren, Elle Rinoa, has my soul nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe Brad Pitt would be a good Lucifer… No. Too blond. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fate and I are on a crash course with destiny looking for the one woman who can change both of our lives—mine for the better—Fate’s for the worse. Never in my wildest imaginings did I think the Devil could have a happily ever after, but now I have hope. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe Jamie Dornan would do me justice… No. Fifty shades of wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Armed with a tremendously bad attitude and my two grumpy nieces in tow, I will find my woman and make her stay—even if I have to cuff her to me for the rest of eternity. Elle Rinoa is mine and as soon as she sees everything my way we will be fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe Dwayne Johnson would be an excellent Satan… No. Too bald. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Whatever. With my insane mother proposing a disturbingly psychotic plan to find my girl and my father breaking every appliance in Heaven and Hell, I feel I have no choice but to go with my mother’s half baked scheme. I’ve done crazy, but this one will take the cake or put me six feet under—for real. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How about Joe Manganiello playing me… No. I’m prettier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My Siren doesn’t know what’s about to hit her. I play for keeps and I play to win. Of course I cheat, but that’s neither here nor there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s showtime folks.</description>

  <description>I know I’m already mated…I wanna get married. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you get when you combine a three headed monster named Charles, a rotund, gay, dancing Demon named Doug, a culinary disaster baked by Mother Nature, a celibate premarital councilor named Jeff, an offer from Satan that’s impossible to refuse and Steve Perry? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the Royal Wedding from Hell—or to be more accurate—possibly in Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I want to do is marry the Vampyre of my dreams with my closest friends and family in attendance. Yep, I know nuptials in the undead world are unheard of, but I’m still hanging onto my humanity if only by a thread. Being mated is great, but getting married is important to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tacky invitations and cake that causes food poisoning aside, I also need to deal with the stream of Demons entering my world from mysteriously opened portals. Not to mention Angel Jeff is going to fail us on the premarital test if we participate in any nookie before the wedding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m trying really hard not to go bridezilla on everyone. With five days to plan the wedding, I have figure out who’s opening the portals and deal with our hostile allies who think our wedding is a farce. It’s been a very difficult week—especially the no nookie part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is this, I will say "I do" on Saturday even if it I have to go to Hell and back to accomplish it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You think your job is tedious? Try being the Harbinger of Evil for a day. &lt;br /&gt;I dare you…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s the Devil to do when his fire no longer burns away his sins and Fate is screwing with his… well, fate? Easy—lie, cheat, steal and dictate my questionably accurate autobiography slash romance novel to my unwilling and outstandingly rude Vampyre niece. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to my Hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A mysterious darkness is gunning for me and this time it might prevail, but I have little time to worry about that. Instead of seeking it out, I shall simply go about business as usual. If it’s fated, it will find me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My list is long. Traveling to Earth to promote my bestselling romance novel at an alarming book convention where I must protect my privates from the rabid lady readers is enough to frighten even the Devil. Not to mention, I have to avoid my insane mother like the plague and catch the smart-mouthed, gorgeous soul seller on Earth—who may or may not be someone I’d like to keep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So today is a day like any other. Punishments must be doled out and chaos must be encouraged. A vacation would be lovely, but there is no rest for the weary… or the evil. Luckily I know how to have an outstanding time doing outrageously bad things. Thank Hades, I’m a handsome bastard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is no fated happily ever after for the Prince of Darkness, no matter what ridiculous ending my niece slaps onto my autobiography. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or is there? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fate is a bitch, but she usually gets it right.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I have to trap the most evil, worst bad dude in existence without actually turning him to ash. So, what’s a Vampyre to do?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For starters, enter an undead beauty pageant—in Oklahoma—where the hair is jacked and the contestants are busty and brainless. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;My name is Venus. I’m a two-hundred-year old killing machine and I’m trading in my daggers and sword for a sparkly dress and an obscene swim suit. Tiny strips of Lycra are not my typical battle wear, but when in Oklahoma… &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Armed with a fairly decent attitude, two debatably heterosexual insane old ladies, a woman I’d wanted to kill less than eight hours ago and the possible love of my undead life, I’m in over my head with this. Of course I have no clue what this is going to entail, but that’s never stopped me before. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;I’m learning quickly nothing is as it seems—not my past and least of all my future. With the not-so-angelic Angels watching our every move and more butt glue, lipstick and hairspray than I knew existed, I’m gonna take my fate by the balls and twist. Hard. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;In a race with death for the cursed life of the man I’m falling in love with, there’s no room for error. Especially when I can’t decide if I’d rather head butt him or jump his sexy bones. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Mixed up in a tangled trap of spotlights, sequins and seduction, I’m gunning for a crown and my happily ever after with the arrogant alpha-hole who makes me feel alive. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;And the winner is… &lt;br /&gt;Hopefully me.</description>

He plays dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to my own personal Hell.&lt;br /&gt;Where life is steamy and the sex is sizzling.&lt;br /&gt;Damn it, I thought the chase was difficult…keeping the girl alive might prove to be my undoing.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is holiday paranormal romantic comedy novella for your reading pleasure!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas at the Cressida House and all Hell is breaking loose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tree? Decorated and lit. Elf on a Shelf? Seated with style. Baby Jesus on the mantle? Fourteen neatly in a row. Life sized Nutcracker? Creepy, but standing proud. Invitations sent to entire immortal family to celebrate the holiday? Possibly the stupidest damn thing I’ve ever done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mixing Heaven and Hell on my cousin’s famous birthday seemed like such a brilliant idea. I wanted my baby’s first Christmas to be special—memorable. I’d like chalk my heinous idea up to having been fallen down drunk, but that won’t fly as it’s insanely difficult for a Vampyre to tie one on. So instead I’ll deal with obscene gifts from relatives, kidnapped rock stars and catering by Mother Nature. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, our new family pet thinks the whole house is his toilet. Ethan and I can’t even find a room with working lock on the door to spread a little holiday cheer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never, never again. Christmas from now on will be at a freakin’ spa for the undead—no poles for dancing and no slumber parties with the Devil. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;I just have to make it through the next twenty-four hours without beheading a beloved one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Merry freakin’ Christmas—and Happy New Year.</description>

  <description>And I thought being half Vampyre/half Demon was hard…That’s nothing compared to being a mother. Sweet baby Moses in a boob tube, there aren’t any books on raising True Immortals so let me give you a few tips…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Make a map of every closet and bathroom in your home if you enjoy having sex. Sleep deprivation can cause confusion and a map will help if you only have seven minutes and thirty-one seconds. You’re welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Parenting books are useless if you're not human. If your child is half Vampyre/ half Demon I would suggest not using parenting books at all--they can backfire like a mother humper. Trust me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Have sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~When your child tells you he has an imaginary friend, do not discount this as fantasy. Often times your child isn't imagining anything. If he persists with alarming and violent stories about this fictional buddy it's probably a Troll. Do a thorough search of your home and kill it. Decapitation works best. Some imaginary friends are harmless. However, it's wise not to take chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Have sex again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~When in large crowds, make sure you hold tight to your child's hand. Losing a child in an amusement park is terrifying. If you're truly paranoid a parent could consider putting a chip in their child. If you do this don't discuss it at dinner parties. People will think you are weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~At least cuddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Playing with dolls is fun. Being one? No so much. If your child ever finds a Genie in a bottle, flush it immediately. Many children wish for things that are very difficult to reverse...like being doll sized. If this happens, move to Oz. There are many people of small stature there. And yes, it really does exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Find a closet and go to town.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Hell.&lt;br /&gt;Literally.&lt;br /&gt;The Hell where the Prince of Darkness is hotter than Hades, Hell Hounds smell like brownies and the Seven Deadly Sins are addicted to Facebook... Not to mention the soundtrack in the Underworld is Journey. For real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known no good could come from offing my parents in the space of twenty minutes no matter how psychotic and evil they were…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I find out my family tree includes almost every deity and mythological being alive while Ethan, the one and only love of my undead life has a limited time down under before he turns to dust. In the land of Sin, you’d think I’d get some nookie time with my man, but no. Baby Demons, cousins and grandparents put the kibosh on that. Blue balls are the new normal. What the hell does a half-Vampyre Half-Demon have to do to catch a break?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently find a freakin’ sword, calm Mother Nature’s unmedicated mood swings and make sure Mister Rogers keeps his sticky fingers to himself during weekly poker with the Devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have three days to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all that’s unholy, I thought Ethan’s Vampyre family was crazy…Trust me, they have nothing on the Demons.</description>

  <description>Where does a Demon go when she gets deported from Hell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kentucky. Eden, Kentucky to be more specific—where nothing is exactly as it seems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Dixie. I’m a Demon—a lousy Demon. I’m a twenty-one year old virgin and I have a battery operated boyfriend. My magic is iffy at best and downright dangerous at worst. Leaving Hell to represent my race is not high on my list of things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell was exact. Hell was simple. All I want to do is get to home base with the hotter than Hades Demon of my dreams and work on my dark side so Satan, my dad, will get off my ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I end up in Kentucky looking for the Balance of Chaos, avoiding pole dancing classes with Mother Nature and finding out my invisible friend is a silver skinned destructive weather pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that isn’t craptastic enough, the damn Sword of Death is missing again and who ever has it wants the King of the Underworld dead. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With new powers emerging daily, keeping my Demon side, horniness and general disgust under wraps doesn’t make it any easier to fit in with the humans. Thankfully my priorities are in line; get laid…save world…try not to blow up kitchen appliances…and get laid again. I was ready to rumble.&lt;br /&gt;All I want to do is go back to Hell, but with the balance of good and evil in my hands, I’m stuck in the garden of Eden. Oh well, what the Hell. Someone has to save the world before there’s no world left to save. Might as well be me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A ruthless gang leader. A deadly vendetta. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karen Rose returns with the break-neck follow-up to MONSTER IN THE CLOSET, and the sixth book in the heart-pounding Baltimore Series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwyn Weaver is as resilient as anyone could be. Having survived an attempted murder, she has rebuilt her life and reclaimed her dignity and strength. She's always known about her feelings for defence attorney Thomas Thorne, but as her friend and a colleague there could be no chance of anything more... or could there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorne has known violence and pain all his life. He's overcome the hardships that have been thrown at him thanks to his own steel, and the love of his loyal friends. Now he's thinking it might finally be time to let his guard down, and allow himself to let in the woman he's always admired from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Thorne's whole world is torn apart — he is found unconscious in his own bed, the lifeless body of a stranger lying next to him, her blood on his hands. Knowing Thorne could never have committed such a terrible crime, Gwyn and his friends rally round to clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But this is just the beginning — the beginning of a brutal campaign to destroy Thorne, and everything he holds dear...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Monster in the Closet&lt;/i&gt; reunites readers with characters from Karen Rose's bestselling Baltimore series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother is dead, and now her killer hunts the child that witnessed the brutal crime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private Investigator Clay Maynard locates missing children for clients, but has nearly given up hope of finding his own daughter, cruelly stolen from him by his ex-wife twenty-three years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equine therapist Taylor Dawson has chosen to intern at Daphne Montgomery-Carter's stables so that she can observe the program's security director - her father, Clay Maynard. Trying to reconcile the wonderful man she's getting to know with the monster her mother always described, Taylor never expects to become the target of a real monster, the man who murdered the mother of the little girls she works with at the stable. Neither does she expect to fall for Ford Elkhart, Daphne's handsome son, who is dealing with his own demons. As family and friends gather for a wedding, Taylor starts to imagine a permanent life in Baltimore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not if the real monster gets to her first...</description>

  <description>Planning my own wedding should mean I’m having the time of my life…not defending it every time I turn around. Dragons, feral Wolves and Were Cows…I mean who in the hell knew Were Cows even existed? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All I wanna do is marry Hank, have 2.5 beautiful little Werewolf babies and live happily ever after while having sex on a very regular basis. Oh…and I still want to shoot stuff occasionally. &lt;br /&gt;Apparently no one got the memo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Instead of complaining about the price of flowers, cakes and the fact that my gay Vampyre BFF, Dwayne insists on wearing a dress at my nuptials, I’m locked and loaded trying to ascertain who wants my ass six feet under. With Hank at my side and some surprising allies at our disposal, we will take on the bad dudes…one bloody clusterhump of a sucktastic battle at a time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one ever said the Werewolf life was going to be easy, but this week we couldn’t catch a break if it bit us in the ass… </description>

  <description>Vampyres don’t exist. They absolutely do not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn’t think they did ‘til I tried to quit smoking and ended up Undead. Who in the hell did I screw over in a former life that my getting healthy equates with dead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m a Vampyre. Yes, we exist whether we want to or not. However, I have to admit, the perks aren’t bad. My girls no longer jiggle, my ass is higher than a kite and the latest Prada keeps finding its way to my wardrobe. On the downside, I’m stuck with an obscenely profane Guardian Angel who looks like Oprah and a Fairy Fighting Coach who’s teaching me to annihilate like the Terminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, my libido has increased to Vampyric proportions and my attraction to a hotter than Satan’s underpants killer rogue Vampyre is not only dangerous . . . it’s possibly deadly. For real dead. Permanent death isn’t on my agenda. Avoiding him is my only option. Of course, since he thinks I’m his, it’s easier said than done. Like THAT’S not enough to deal with, all the other Vampyres think I’m some sort of Chosen One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy Hell, if I’m in charge of saving an entire race of blood suckers, the Undead are in for one hell of a ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I need a new freakin’ job.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s not what you think. I’m desperate to resign from the Werewolf Treaty Federation &lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; WTF. Don’t judge. I didn’t name this crew of misfit Shifters so hear me out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After investigating a deadly Jazz Cabbage outbreak, I discover we need a necromancing Demon to help solve the crime. As luck would have it, my gay Vampyre BFF, Dwayne, dated one of these gems several decades ago. Seems all we need to do is summon his evil butt into this plane of existence and poof, crisis solved. The question is, can we bring him back without causing a flesh-eating, end of the world Zombie Apocalypse? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With my hunky mate, insane Granny and flamboyant Dwayne by my side, we have no choice but to succeed. If we don’t, the reveal of our existence to the human world is imminent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We are Shifters. Werewolves. WTF. &lt;i&gt;Shift Happens&lt;/i&gt; all the time. But this time, we’re making sure only good &lt;i&gt;shift&lt;/i&gt; goes down.</description>

  <description>It's a battle I’ve waged most of my life, but now the odds are looking crappy. Before I go up flames, I have to find a way to save my horde and make sure my secret treasure is safe. There is one way I could stick around a bit longer, but the men I’ve met aren’t exactly lining up to save me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What in hell does a Dragon Princess have to do to find a mate? Offing my father, the reviled Dragon King, would be one way to go. He has a penchant for eliminating any male who shows interest—not to mention he’s been trying to kill me for almost 500 years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my brilliant plan is to take out my father in a blaze of glory—pun intended. However, I have to suck it up and do some stuff I don’t want to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, getting along with Dragons who don’t trust me is a horrific challenge even though we share the same goal. That’s why I aligned myself with the rag tag pack of shifters who accepted me and my secret treasure unconditionally. They’re my friends now and I’m keeping them. I’ll fry anyone who dares to speak against my Werewolves, Werecows and the fabulous gay Vampyre named Dwayne. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the Weres who love me don’t have the kind of fire power I need to take out my father. To get that I have allied myself with a dangerous group of Dragons known as The Resistance. Staying away from the sexy, pompous, fire-breathing, blow hard of a leader is turning out to be a full time job. And no… he’s not even in the running for the mate. Mutual incineration would be inevitable—or sexual combustion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see… Dragons aren’t the easiest of the species to get along with. You can dress us up and take us out, but at the end of the day we’re still the idiots who like a little friendly blood shed and sex—make that lots of sex. My life keeps getting more and more complicated, but I’ve run out of options. I’m about to run out of time too. I’m learning there’s no where to run and no where to hide from destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young widow returns to Lake Sackett, Georgia to face the ghosts of her past—and decide if she’s ready to take another chance on love—in the third sparkling Southern Eclectic novel that “goes down as easy as honey on a deep-fried Twinkie” (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, on &lt;i&gt;Sweet Tea and Sympathy&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Bowman would never have guessed that her best friend, Duffy McCready (of McCready’s Bait Shop &amp;amp; Funeral Home) has been in love with her since they were kids. Fear of rejection and his own romantic complications prevented Duffy from confessing his true feelings in high school, so he stood by and watched her wed Wayne Bowman right after high school. Wayne had always been a cheapskate, so it comes as no surprise when he suffers a fatal accident while fixing his own truck.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even as her family and friends invade Lucy’s life and insist that the new widow is too fragile to do much beyond weeping, Lucy is ashamed to admit that life without Wayne is easier, less complicated. After all, no one knew what a relentless, soul-grinding trudge marriage to Wayne had been. Only Duffy can tell she’s hiding something.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In need of a fresh start, Lucy asks Duffy to put his cabinet-building skills to use, transforming the town's meat shop into a bake shop. As the bakery takes shape, Lucy and Duffy discover the spark that pulled them together so many years ago. Could this finally be the second chance he’s always hoped for?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Once again Molly Harper “writes characters you can’t help but fall in love with” (&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) in this charming and entertaining love story.</description>

  <description>An Atlanta ex-cop comes to sleepy Lake Sackett, Georgia, seeking peace and quiet—but he hasn’t bargained on falling for Frankie, the cutest coroner he’s ever met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie McCready talks to dead people. Not like a ghost whisperer or anything—but it seems rude to embalm them and not at least say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, at the McCready Family Funeral Home &amp;amp; Bait Shop, Frankie’s eccentricities fit right in. Lake Sackett’s embalmer and county coroner, Frankie’s goth styling and passion for nerd culture mean she’s not your typical Southern girl, but the McCreadys are hardly your typical Southern family. Led by Great-Aunt Tootie, the gambling, boozing, dog-collecting matriarch of the family, everyone looks out for one another—which usually means getting up in everyone else’s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that’s why Frankie is so fascinated by new sheriff Eric Linden...a recent transplant from Atlanta, he sees a homicide in every hunting accident or boat crash, which seems a little paranoid for this sleepy tourist town. What’s he so worried about? And what kind of cop can get a job with the Atlanta PD but can’t stand to look at a dead body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie has other questions that need answering first—namely, who’s behind the recent break-in attempts at the funeral home, and how can she stop them? This one really does seem like a job for the sheriff—and as Frankie and Eric do their best Scooby-Doo impressions to catch their man, they get closer to spilling some secrets they thought were buried forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Carl and Marianne were high school sweethearts, loving the way only teenagers can—with no thought to logic or pride, just a bone-headed, optimistic frenzy of unicorns and hormones. That was all they needed. Or so Carl thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scared of being stuck in Lake Sackett, Georgia, like so many of her friends—without a real shot at a future or achieving her own dreams—Marianne panicked and bolted to college after stomping Carl’s heart into the high grass. But when she returns to Lake Sackett for the summer with her family after years away, she and Carl are drawn together like moths to a flame. As they rekindle their old romance and remember what it was like to be in love, they have to wonder: is this, finally, their real chance at happiness?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Kristan Higgins and Amy E. Reichert, this warmhearted and witty love story introduces Molly Harper’s new Southern Eclectic series set in the small town of Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 3 hrs and 32 mins</description>

  <description>I never planned on going back to Hung Island, Georgia. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a top notch Were agent for the secret paranormal Council and happily living in Chicago where I had everything I needed – a gym membership, season tickets to the Cubs and Dwayne – my gay, Vampyre best friend. Going back now would mean facing the reason I’d left and I’d rather chew my own paw off than deal with Hank. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hank the Tank Wilson was the six foot three, obnoxious, egotistical, perfect-assed, best-sex-of-my-life, Werewolf who cheated on me and broke my heart. At the time, I did what any rational woman would do. I left in the middle of the night with a suitcase, big plans and enough money for a one-way bus ticket to freedom. I vowed to never return. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But here I am, trying to wrap my head around what has happened to some missing Weres without wrapping my body around Hank. I hope I don’t have to eat my words and my paw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This novella originally appeared in the Three Southern Beaches collection released July of 2014. This is an extended version of that story.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.A. Jance’s gripping new thriller, &lt;i&gt;Man Overboard&lt;/i&gt;, two tech geniuses face off—one intent on saving lives, the other on ending them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cybersecurity expert Roger McGeary finally has his life back on track after years of struggling with depression. But when he falls from the balcony of his suite on an all-expenses-paid cruise, the police quickly dismiss it as “death by misadventure,” a vague phrase leaving much to interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unsatisfied, Roger’s tough-as-nails aunt, Julia Miller, is determined to find answers and closure. By contacting Roger’s childhood friend Stuart Ramey to help her solve the mystery of his fate, Julia unwittingly sets up a collision course with a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stuart, his sidekick Cami Lee, and journalist turned amateur sleuth Ali Reynolds put the full resources of cutting edge online security firm High Noon Enterprises into learning the truth about Roger’s death. With Cami on the high seas investigating the ship from which Roger disappeared, Stuart stays tied to his computer, locked in a battle of wits and technology against an unusually twisted adversary. Aided by Frigg, an artificial intelligence companion of his own creation, the killer targets victims who have lost parents to suicide and attempts to drive them to the same tragic end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the heartless killer and his cyber accomplice set their sights on Stuart, High Noon must race against time to save him and countless others.</description>

  <description>The murder of an ex-drug dealer ex-con—gunned down on his mother's doorstep—seems just another turf war fatality. Why then has Seattle homicide investigator J.P. Beaumont been instructed to keep this assignment hush-hush? Meanwhile, Beau's lover and fellow cop, Mel Soames, is involved in her own confidential investigation. Registered sex offenders from all over Washington State are dying at an alarming rate—and not all due to natural causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A metropolis the size of Seattle holds its fair share of brutal crime, corruption, and dirty little secrets. But when the separate trails they're following begin to shockingly intertwine, Beau and Mel realize that they have stumbled onto something bigger and more frightening than they anticipated—a deadly conspiracy that's leading them to lofty places they should not enter . . . and may not be allowed to leave alive.</description>

  <description>Fifty years ago, when she was five, Sister Mary Katherine witnessed something terrible . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former Seattle policeman now working for the Washington State Attorney's Special Homicide Investigation Team, J.P. Beaumont has been hand-picked to lead the investigation into a half-century-old murder. An eyewitness to the crime, a middle-aged nun, has now recalled grisly, forgotten details while undergoing hypnotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a case as cold as the grave, and it's running headlong into another that's tearing at Beau's heart: the vicious slaying of his former partner's ex-wife. What's worse, his rapidly unraveling friend is the prime suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in the middle of a lethal conspiracy that spans two generations and a killing that hits too close to home -- targeted by a vengeful adversary and tempted by a potential romance that threatens to reawaken his personal demons -- Beaumont may suddenly have more on his plate than he can handle, and far too much to survive.</description>

  <description>The dead woman on a cold slab in the Arizona morgue was a talented artist recently arrived from the West Coast. The Washington State Attorney General's office thinks this investigation is too big for a small-town female law officer to handle, so they're sending Sheriff Joanna Brady some unwanted help -- a seasoned detective named Beaumont. Sheriff Brady resents his intrusion, and Bisbee, Arizona, with its ghosts and memories, is the last place J.P. Beaumont wants to be. But the twisting desert road they must reluctantly travel together is leading them into a very deadly nest of rattlers. And if they hope to survive, suddenly trust is the only option they have left...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author J.A. Jance returns with the thirteenth pulse-pounding thriller in the “engaging and entertaining” (&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;) Ali Reynolds series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking down the man responsible for his best friend’s death, Stuart Ramey believes the case is finally closed. That is, until Stu discovers he’s been left with a multimillion dollar fortune in Bitcoin in a desperate attempt by Frigg, a rogue A.I. program created by the killer, to keep itself from being fully deactivated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To take Frigg down for good, Stu enlists the help of Ali Reynolds and the rest of his cyber security colleagues at High Noon Enterprises. But they are not the only ones who know about Frigg’s existence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Graciella Miramar, an unassuming accountant to all appearances, is actually the right-hand woman to El Pescado&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;the leader of a dangerous drug cartel. She’ll do anything to get her hands on that program. With Frigg’s help, Graciella hopes to take over El Pescado’s criminal underworld and become wealthy beyond her wildest dreams. But Stu—and El Pescado and his henchmen—may not be so easily defeated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the “grand master of the game” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Providence Journal&lt;/i&gt;), J.A. Jance crafts another electrifying thriller that shows that everything has its price.</description>

  <description>Shifter Catrina Macintyre has roamed the wilderness of Alaska as a lone wolf for six years. Imprisoned in her wolf form by a promise to her mother, she seeks the opportunity to discover the truth about her parents’ murders. When an Alpha saves her and takes her to his pack, she has to decide whether he will aid her...or destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killian Stone is the Alpha of Wolf Creek, determined to save what the Shifter race is quick to dismiss or kill: lone-Shifters. After years of disappointment, finding Cat was a relief. That is until the intriguing and challenging she-wolf reveals a past that could put his pack in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their undeniable attraction toward each other threatens to collapse Cat’s defensive walls. She’s torn between the hope of a future, and the lingering pain of her past. The truth may be more than either of them anticipated, threatening not only Cat, but the whole Shifter race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Killian convince Cat to abandon her quest for vengeance before it destroys them all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nora Roberts introduces you to the Montgomery brothers - Beckett, Ryder, and Owen - as they bring an intimate bed-and-breakfast to life in their hometown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryder is the hardest Montgomery brother to figure out - with a tough-as-nails outside and possibly nothing too soft underneath. He's surly and unsociable, but when he straps on a toolbelt, no woman can resist his sexy swagger. Except, apparently, Hope Beaumont, the innkeeper of his own Inn BoonsBoro...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the former manager of a D.C. hotel, Hope is used to excitement and glamour, but that doesn't mean she can't appreciate the joys of small-town living. She's where she wants to be - except for in her love life. Her only interaction with the opposite sex has been sparring with the infuriating Ryder, who always seems to get under her skin. Still, no one can deny the electricity that crackles between them...a spark that ignited with a New Year's Eve kiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the inn is running smoothly, thanks to Hope's experience and unerring instincts, her big-city past is about to make an unwelcome - and embarrassing - appearance. Seeing Hope vulnerable stirs up Ryder's emotions and makes him realize that while Hope may not be perfect, she just might be perfect for him...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Owen is the organizer of the Montgomery clan, running the family's construction business with an iron fist - and an even less flexible spreadsheet. And though his brothers give him grief for his compulsive list making, the Inn BoonsBoro is about to open right on schedule. The only thing Owen didn't plan for was Avery MacTavish....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery's popular pizza place is right across the street from the inn, giving her a first-hand look at its amazing renovation — and a newfound appreciation for Owen. Since he was her first boyfriend when they were kids, Owen has never been far from Avery's thoughts. But the attraction she's feeling for him now is far from innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Avery and Owen cautiously take their relationship to another level, the opening of the inn gives the whole town of BoonsBoro a reason to celebrate. But Owen's hard work has only begun. Getting Avery to let down her guard is going to take longer than he expected — and so will getting her to realize that her first boyfriend is going to be her last....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording (10 hours, 40 minutes).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The historic hotel in Boonsboro has endured war and peace, changing hands, even rumored hauntings. Now it’s getting a major facelift from the Montgomery brothers and their eccentric mother. Beckett is the architect of the family, and his social life consists mostly of talking shop over pizza and beer. But there’s another project he’s got his eye on: the girl he’s been waiting to kiss since he was fifteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her husband and returning to her hometown, Clare Brewster soon settles into her life as the mother of three young sons while running the town’s bookstore. Busy, with little time for romance, Clare is drawn across the street by Beckett’s transformation of the old inn, wanting to take a closer look . . . at the building and the man behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the grand opening inching closer, Beckett’s happy to give Clare a private tour - one room at a time. It’s no first date, but these stolen moments are the beginning of something new - and open the door to the extraordinary adventure of what comes next . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gritty and gripping new novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series, Eve Dallas fights to save the innocent—and serve justice to the guilty—on the streets of New York.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide cop Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband, Roarke, are building a brand-new school and youth shelter. They know that the hard life can lead kids toward dangerous crossroads—and with this new project, they hope to nudge a few more of them onto the right path. For expert help, they hire child psychologist Dr. Rochelle Pickering—whose own brother pulled himself out of a spiral of addiction and crime with Rochelle’s support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyle is living with Rochelle while he gets his life together, and he’s thrilled to hear about his sister’s new job offer. But within hours, triumph is followed by tragedy. Returning from a celebratory dinner with her boyfriend, she finds Lyle dead with a syringe in his lap, and Eve’s investigation confirms that this wasn’t just another OD. After all his work to get clean, Lyle’s been pumped full of poison—and a neighbor with a peephole reports seeing a scruffy, pink-haired girl fleeing the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Eve and Roarke must venture into the gang territory where Lyle used to run, and the ugly underground world of tattoo parlors and strip joints where everyone has taken a wrong turn somewhere. They both believe in giving people a second chance. Maybe even a third or fourth. But as far as they’re concerned, whoever gave the order on Lyle Pickering’s murder has run out of chances…</description>

  <description>A decade ago, sculptor Clare Kimball fled Emmitsboro, Maryland, to take the art world by storm. Now she’s celebrated as the artist of her generation. But no amount of success can eclipse the nightmares that haunt her—or the memories of her father’s suicide. Just as her star is shining brighter than ever, Clare leaves it all behind to face her demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmitsboro sheriff Cameron Rafferty loved Clare from afar all through high school. Now that she’s back, they form a bond that grows stronger each day—fueled by an attraction that’s been simmering for years. But Clare’s past soon rises up with a vengeance, rocking the town with a sinister murder that is clearly linked to her return. As an investigation gets under way, Clare and Cameron will learn that evil can linger anywhere—even in those you love and trust the most. But it’s a discovery that may come too late to save them.…</description>

  <description>From beloved romance author Molly Harper (&lt;i&gt;Half-Moon Hollow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nice Girls&lt;/i&gt; series) comes the first title in her new rom-com women’s fiction series, Southern Eclectic, which features the lives, losses and loves of the McCready family as they manage their family’s generational funeral home and bait shop (you read that correctly) on the shore of picturesque Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type-A Margot Cary is the leading event planner for the crème de la crème of Chicago high society. No request is too extravagant for her to execute with trademark perfection. That is, until an unfortunate incident involving a shrimp tower, live flamingos, and a shellfish allergy puts her on the black list of the rich and social and out of a job. With the lights about to be shut off in the trendy condo she can no longer afford, and her savings account dwindling, Margot’s situation is near to desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In steps her birth father’s side of the family (who she’s never met), the McCreadys…the McCreadys of the McCready Family Funeral Home and Bait Shop in small town Georgia—and as luck would have it, they’re looking for an event planner and don’t care about her reputation among the A-list crowd. As Margot tackles small town life—where everyone knows everything about everyone—and builds a relationship with a father who she’d never known, she discovers the comforts that community, a rather large extended family, and a rugged, unpretentious country man can offer...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Available in audio first, this hot, hilarious stand-alone will keep you wildly entertained! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Mystic Bayou, a tiny town hidden in the swamp where shape-shifters, vampires, witches, and dragons live alongside humans. The town formed around the mysterious energy rift in the bayou, which helps keep the town's magic in balance. But lately the rift has been widening and destabilizing - threatening to send the town's magical population into chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Energy witch Danica Teel has been sent by the League to figure out what's going on, with the help of bear-shifter Mayor Zed. While working on the case, Zed falls head over paws for Dani, but she's reluctant to engage in anything beyond a roll in his cave. Dani's family is counting on her to get the job done, and she has no time for distractions. But when an ominous presence begins stalking Dani through the bayou, they'll need to band together to make it out alive.</description>

  <description>Most humans have no idea that a dark and deadly underworld, filled with magic and monsters, exists. They wander through life blissfully ignorant of the supernatural world around them. Nora Jacobs is different. Nora knows exactly what kinds of hellish creatures haunt the streets of Detroit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a unique set of psychic abilities, Nora has managed to steer clear of the underworld most of her life. But all that changes the night the most powerful vampire in the city discovers her gifts and decides to use her as a tool to find one of his missing clan members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that’s not bad enough, Nora believes she’s cursed. All her life, people, especially men, have been drawn to her—some to the point of obsession and violence. Underworlders, it seems, are not immune to this curse, and now she’s caught the attention of some of the most dangerous monsters in the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neck deep in an investigation only she can solve, Nora quickly makes as many new allies as she does enemies. Her biggest problem is staying alive long enough to decide which is which.</description>

  <description>IS HE HER MORTAL ENEMY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Shay is the last of her kind. Half human, half Shalott, her blood is a precious aphrodisiac to vampires, who consider it more precious than gold. Though Shalotts are renowned assassins, a curse held over Shay lands her on the slave auction block, where her fate is uncertain-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OR THE MAN WHO WILL RISK IT ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viper, the beguiling chief of a deadly vampire clan, can't explain his longing to possess the beautiful Shalott who once saved his life, but now he is free to do anything he wants with her. Strangely, while he desires both Shay-s blood and body, he wants her to surrender willingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO SAVE HER LIFE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hidden evil has been stalking Shay since she left the slave market with Viper. It is an evil that endangers the very existence of Viper's kind, and there's no reason he should court such danger just to protect a Shalott. But the love he feels for Shay is enough to make him willing to go to hell and back if it means spending an eternity with her in his arms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WELCOME TO ALPHAVILLE, where the she-wolves and alpha-males play. . .for keeps.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Renny Landry is a wolf on the run. Pursued by a shapeshifting stalker and his slobbering pack of killer coyotes, she is forced to flee her job as a librarian to find sanctuary in the wooded hills of Alpha, Washington. A well-secluded safe space for troubled shifters, Alpha is Renny’s last hope. But the first person she meets there is a gorgeous alpha male with fiery eyes, fierce tattoos, and one ferocious appetite—for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mick Fischer thought he left his past behind when he moved to Alpha. But fate has a way of biting him in the tail when a female wolf shows up on his property. Wounded, desperate—and disarmingly hot—Renny brings out the snarling, protective alpha beast in Mick like no other woman he’s known. Can these two haunted, hunted wolves manage to mate for life…even as the deadliest past demons howl at their heels?</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Eve Dallas puzzles over a bizarre suicide bombing in a Wall St. office building in the latest in the #1 New York Times bestselling series…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the airline executives finalizing a merger that would make news in the business world, the nine a.m. meeting would be a major milestone. But after marketing VP Paul Rogan walked into the plush conference room, strapped with explosives, the headlines told of death and destruction instead. The NYPSD’s Eve Dallas confirms that Rogan was cruelly coerced by two masked men holding his family hostage. His motive was saving his wife and daughter―but what was the motive of the masked men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the chaos and bad publicity, blowing up one meeting isn’t going to put the brakes on the merger. All it’s accomplished is shattering a lot of innocent lives. Now, with the help of her billionaire husband Roarke, Eve must untangle the reason for an inexplicable act of terror, look at suspects inside and outside both corporations, and determine whether the root of this crime lies in simple sabotage, or something far more complex and twisted.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Greek hotel magnate Chrysander Anetakis's former mistress was pregnant? And had amnesia? That meant Marley Jameson didn't remember betraying him by selling company secrets. Or that he'd thrown her out of his life. So he told her a little white lie: they were engaged. Then he swept her away to his Greek island to await the birth of his baby and enjoy her sudden devotion...before tossing her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But he didn't count on Marley regaining her memory so soon.</description>

  <description>Tycoon Theron Anetakis had only one problem--and she just walked through his door. With his business takeover complete, he'd intended to arrange a marriage for himself to further secure his future. However...Little Isabella Caplan had blossomed into a voluptuous vixen with plans of her own, and they didn't include letting the executor of her father's estate also arrange a marriage for her to another man! She had pined for Theron long enough. Now it was time to seduce her hot-blooded hotel tycoon and bring him to one bended knee.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of a boss's big surprise by #1 &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; and USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR MAYA BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only supposed to be a vacation romance: passionate, exciting—and short-lived. But when Jewel Henley arrived for her first day of work at a new job, she realized her exotic lover was in fact Piers Anetakis, her boss. A boss who had a strict rule about not getting involved with his employees. Before she knew it, Jewel found herself without a job…and pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, five months later, Piers finally tracks down his one-night lover. Determined to explain the mistakes he made, he is confronted with an undeniable truth: Jewel is carrying his child. The only honorable solution is to marry. Yet is there more between them than lust? Because attentive as he is, Jewel knows he still doesn't trust her. And until he does, all they have…is an affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Pick!…An extraordinarily moving romance with wonderfully charismatic protagonists."&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Affair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE AFFAIR was originally published as &lt;em&gt;The Tycoon's Secret Affair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bodyguard Celia Graves has definitely accepted her share of weird assignments, both human and supernatural. But her newest job takes the cake. Guarding a prince from terrorists and religious fundamentalists is hard enough, but it seems like the entire supernatural world is after this guy too. When she is betrayed by those she is employed to help, and everything goes horribly wrong, Celia wakes to find herself transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither human nor vampire, Celia has become an abomination-something that should not exist-and now both human and supernatural alike want her dead. With the help of a few loyal friends-a sexy mage, a powerful werewolf, and a psychic cop-Celia does her best to stay alive. On the run from her enemies, Celia must try to discover who is behind her transformation . . . before it's too late.</description>

  <description>In Celia Graves’s world, vampires roam the alleys of Tinseltown, street corner psychics have real powers, and cops use memory enhancement spells. But Celia thought she was an ordinary human, albeit one with a clairvoyant best friend and a ghostly little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vampire attack that made Celia an Abomination forces her to take food in liquid form and gives a whole new meaning to the word “sunburn.” She’s slowly adjusting (therapy sessions and all) when she discovers that the attack awakened a hidden part of her heritage: Celia is part Siren, able to enthrall men—and enrage women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her best friend’s murder is unsolved; the cops think Celia should be in jail or staked; and her old lover, mage Bruno DeLuca, has something important to tell her. To top it all off, Celia’s been summoned to the Sirens’ island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celia Graves has more than one enemy. Some of them want her blood. Some of them want her soul. All of them want her dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Siren Song&lt;/i&gt;, Book Two in the Blood Singer series, is another thrilling paranormal fantasy from bestselling author Cat Adams—an action-packed follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Blood Song&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In a world where magic and science sit side by side, and powerful witches are considered necessary aides for all governments, Lizzie Grace is something of an outlier. Though born into one the most powerful blue blood witch families, she wants nothing to do with either her past or her magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she and Belle, her human familiar and best friend, open a small cafe in the Faelan werewolf reservation, she quickly finds herself enmeshed in the hunt for a vampire intent on wreaking bloody havoc. It’s a hunt that soon becomes personal, and one that is going to take all her skills to survive–that’s if the werewolves, who hate all things witch, don’t get her first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Immortality bites- new from the author of &lt;i&gt;Accidentally Dead&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Accidental Werewolf&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wanda Schwartz is raking in the dough selling Bobbie-Sue Cosmetics-and she's a pro at recruiting new sales&lt;i&gt;women&lt;/i&gt;. So, she's shocked when a man comes to one of her in-home parties-a very hot man. Heath Jefferson is sure to put some extra spin into a lot of women's color wheels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Wanda is diagnosed with a terminal illness, it doesn't have to be a death sentence. With a werewolf and a vampire for best friends, she has options that most ordinary people wouldn't. As Wanda ponders what to do about her mortality, Heath reveals he has secrets, and one of them is that his former bloodlust has turned into an old-fashioned lust-for Wanda. And he's already given up too much to lose the love of his lifetimes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A vampire puts the bite on a dental assistant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's a lousy first day on the job for Nina Blackman when a patient, loopy from the anesthesia, bites her. At least he was cute. But for real drama she can't beat the next evening. Nina wakes up with a set of razor-sharp fangs, bionic vision, supersonic hearing, and a taste for blood. But there's a good explanation: It's her patient, Long Island vampire Greg Statleon. Actually they're perfect for each other—if Nina's willing to commit to one man for eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In this thrilling new Night Rebel series set in New York Times bestselling author Jeaniene Frost’s Night Huntress world, sexy and ruthless vampire Ian finally meets his match!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rule Breaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master vampire Ian is unrepentant, shameless…and every shade of wicked. He’s made one too many enemies in his two centuries of existence, including Dagon, a demon who now lays claim to his soul. Ian’s only chance to escape Dagon is to join forces with a Law Guardian, but he’s never been able to abide by the rules for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Law Maker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veritas’ normal role is police, judge and jury to reprobates like Ian. But she has her own ax to grind with Dagon, so if she can use Ian as bait…well, all’s fair in law and war. As they scour supernatural hotspots to perfect their trap, Veritas soon realizes Ian’s devil-may-care, roguish image hides something much more powerful. And Ian discovers that Veritas has shocking secrets of her own. As they’re drawn to each other with a passion as intense as their peril, either love or justice will prevail. But each will have devastating consequences…</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Marion can’t remember anything before waking up in the hospital. All she knows that a lot of people want to kill her. And her would-be assassins are not human…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampires are real. So are faeries and angels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all want Marion dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by enemies, Marion turns to Lucas Flynn: a mysterious doctor who seems to know more than he’s letting on. He’s as good with a gun as he is with a scalpel. He fights like a demon but claims that he’s human. And he’s hellbent on protecting Marion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas claims that Marion is a mage: half-witch, half-angel with terrifying powers that could crack the world. But Marion can’t remember how to cast magic any more than she can remember where she comes from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion must find her identity and her power…before the forgotten sins of her past catch up with her.</description>

Now, for the first time in hardcover, comes her classic novel &lt;em&gt;A Woman Betrayed&lt;/em&gt;, a tale with all the hallmarks of her impressive talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura and Jeff Frye have a happy twenty-year marriage and two terrific kids. With a successful catering business as well, Laura has everything she could ask for. Then Jeff mysteriously disappears, and Laura's picture perfect life is shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura maintains that the Jeff she knew would never leave voluntarily. But what about the Jeff she didn't know? As her husband's many secrets come to light, Laura left with a surprising picture of the man she married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaken to the core, Laura looks for ways to hold her family together and rebuild her life. What she finds is a strength she never knew she had -- and a love she thought she had lost forever. With an utterly compelling plot and writing that unerringly goes straight to the essential matters of the heart, this unforgettable story delivers everything that readers have come to love in Barbara Delinsky's novels.</description>

  <description>Rising sous-chef Kelly Matlock's sudden collapse at work is a wake-up call. Disillusioned and burned out, she's retreated to her sister Jillian's house in Virgin River to rest and reevaluate.&lt;p&gt;Puttering in Jill's garden and cooking with her heirloom vegetables is wonderful, but Virgin River is a far cry from San Francisco. Kelly's starting to feel a little &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; unmotivated…until she meets Lief Holbrook. The handsome widower looks more like a lumberjack than a sophisticated screenwriter—a combination Kelly finds irresistible. But less appealing is Lief's rebellious stepdaughter, Courtney. She's the reason they moved from L.A., but Courtney's finding plenty of trouble even in Virgin River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly's never fallen for a guy with such serious baggage, but some things are worth fighting for. Besides, a bratty teenager can't be any worse than a histrionic chef…right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>ONLY ONE THING STANDS BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE DEADLY SUPERNATURAL WORLD…THE ACADEMY OF ASSASSINS. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Abandoned as a child and unable to remember her past, Morgan was raised as a hunter, one of an elite group of fighters sworn to protect humans from the dangerous paranormal creatures who invade our world…creatures such as herself. Her life changes the day she’s summoned to the Academy of Assassins, a school that trains witches and hunters to eradicate paranormals who prey on humans. Her first assignment—find and eliminate the killer who is using the Academy as their own personal hunting ground. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Morgan delves deeper into the investigation, she will need to dodge assassination attempts, avoid the distraction of romantic entanglements with the devilishly handsome security expert, Kincade, and his maddeningly overprotective teammates, while keeping the volatile magic in her blood concealed from those who would use it for their own purposes. When the danger increases and the school is threatened, Morgan must unearth her missing memories before someone finishes the job they started so long ago—killing her and unleashing a plague that will consume the world.</description>

  <description>The employees of Bad Boy Inc. are gathering for a celebration. The bride sported the latest in bullet proof corsets. The groom wore a gun. The guests came armed for action. But the cake blew up before they could eat it. As for the honeymoon, it’s going to be a mad chase across the globe dodging bullets and bombs to find the culprit who wants them all dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, Darren fell for a woman while in the world’s most romantic city. In full view of the Eiffel tower he had his heart torn from his chest and stomped on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time for revenge. Francesca played Darren for a fool, but he won’t let it happen again. Now that he’s found her, she’s going to pay for her actions. Problem is she’s getting under his skin. Rubbing against his skin. Making him remember those Paris days and hotter nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he can decide if he’s crazy enough to fall in love with her again, everything explodes after the wedding.</description>

  <description>She might be small but she'll still kick your ass. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An assignment to babysit a rich dude isn’t Kacy’s idea of a fun assignment. Especially since he and his bodyguard are just like all the other boys she knows, thinking she’s too tiny to pack a punch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; I’ll show him. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She’ll show him that sexy things come in small packages and he won’t be able to stop himself from falling for the pint-sized protector. Problem is, who’ll protect his heart?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a gunman threatens her life, he wants to send her away, but her Latina pride won’t allow herself to be treated like anything less than a pro.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will pride also stand in the way of her happiness? </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate cover edition - ASIN B00MMQ7XGY.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should Trista you do when faced with a hunky werebear who can’t decide if he wants to kill her or screw her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-hyena, Trista has spent years rotating between Grayslake, Redby, and Boyne Falls. When the Grayslake Itan—the local clan’s werebear leader—orders a purge of all hyenas, she finds herself fighting to hold onto the hand-to-mouth life she’s created. Her carefully built existence is threatened further when a gorgeous werebear strides into her life and demands not just her heart, but her very soul. She’ll think about it, but not until her shift ends at seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keen seems like a happy-go-lucky, sex-and-sin werebear, but that’s nowhere near the truth. In reality, his inner-animal wants to go on a bloody rampage and kill half of Grayslake—just because it can. After that, it wants to claim the seductive, curvaceous half-hyena female Keen can’t get out of his head. The animal doesn’t care that most bears wouldn’t mind a little hyena tartare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Nope, it peers at her through Keen’s human eyes and has one thought: mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When push comes to shove, Keen has to decide if he would rather have the family he was born with, or Trista-the woman who makes him realize that true happiness comes in a lush, hyena-shaped package.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate cover edition - ASIN B00P6N2GH6.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when a half-blind weremole girl falls for a scarred werebear guy? A match made in furry, dirt-caked heaven. Mostly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weremole Kira Kolanowski has spent twenty-nine-ish years of her life half-blind and occasionally half-dead. (Her family isn’t exactly loving.) In an effort to remain fully alive, she moves to Grayslake, Georgia, with her poor excuse for a guide dog—a guide dog who decides to lift his leg and relieve himself on sexy-smelling werebear Isaac Abrams’ belongings. And when he roars…well, it makes her heart go pitter-patter and other parts go “ooh baby, ooh baby.” Just when she thinks she might have found happiness, a raving she-bitch werebear chick tries to kill her with the same poison that scarred Isaac to hell and back. The poison that Kira’s family happens to manufacture…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaac Abrams is leaving Grayslake. He’s tried, lord how he’s tried, to settle into life in Grayslake after the birth of his niece, but it’s not happening. He’s been home for a year, and it’s been 365 plus days of women looking past him and flat-out pretending he doesn’t exist. The battle with the hyenas didn’t just ruin his face, it ruined his chances at finding a mate in his hometown. So, he’s leaving. Or he was leaving until one day a lush, curvaceous weremole wanders into his half-packed house with that damned peeing dog of hers…it’s a good thing she’s so gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he will stay—stay and keep Kira Kolanowski all to himself. Well, once he kills everyone who’s trying to kill her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fourth and final book in Karen Rose's nail-biting Cincinnati Series revisits your favourite characters battling crime in the city's dark underbelly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide detective Adam Kimble is no stranger to battling demons. But Meredith Fallon is a different kind of weakness: one that could actually be good for him, if only he would let himself depend on her. Meredith has loved Adam for a year, and seeing how hard he's worked to deal with his PTSD makes her feelings only stronger, but she respects his needs. Her work keeps her busy anyway: she counsels sexually abused women like Mallory Martin to help them reintegrate into the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someone doesn't want Meredith helping women like Mallory, and Meredith finds herself in the crosshairs of a very determined killer. Adam would risk anything for her, but they'll soon find out she isn't the only target...</description>

  <description>Who needs claws when you’ve got a baseball bat? Lauren Evans sure as heck doesn’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Human Lauren has a protective streak a mile wide and one immediate goal in life—get her best friend out of an abusive household. If that involves a little bat-based redecorating, so be it. Unfortunately—or fortunately—a certain sexy-as-hell cop breaks up the fight before she has a chance to really get going. Grayslake police officer Van Abrams is too hot for his own good, and his handcuffs make all those wonderful places tingle. Too bad he, you know, arrested her and stuff. But then he becomes overbearing, demanding, and commanding. Suddenly Lauren finds herself in his arms, in his bed, and mated to his werebear butt. What’s up with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Werebear Enforcer Van Abrams doesn’t want anything to do with humans. He’s got reasons, and they’re damn good ones. He doesn’t need to explain himself to anyone, especially the curvaceous, luscious, gorgeous, human Lauren. Then, his bear decides Lauren is his mate and Van’s anti-human feelings abandon him. He still hasn’t figured out if that’s a good thing. Of course, when danger rolls in from Boyne Falls and joins with a powerful prick from Grayslake, Van realizes that, human or not, Lauren is his.&lt;br /&gt; Van hopes he can kill their enemies and still make it home for dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Warning: This book contains bad guys (more than one) being bad to good girls (two if you’re counting), and one group of humans who sorta end up… dead. Unfortunately, all that comes with a lot of blood, tears, and balls of fur. In this one, boy bears really do drool and human girls rule (and kick ass). We also learn that you can never have enough baseball bats, brake fluid, or fire pokers. Just sayin’.</description>

  <description>The first day of Mia’s new life in Grayslake, Georgia is not going as planned. The house her grandfather left her looks ready to crumble, boxes cover every inch of the floor and—oh—there’s a bear cub in her pantry. It gets worse when the cub’s uncle comes by and busts out his fur and claws while on her front porch. Then it gets loads better because suddenly there’s a hot hunk of badge-wearing werebear on her lawn ready to rescue her. Yum. Of course, he has to ruin things by trying to take the cub out of her hands. Ha! The cub is hers… No ifs, ands, or bears about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Werebear Ty can’t seem to get the curvaceous, delectable Mia to understand that, even if she is one-quarter werebear, she isn’t keeping the cub. Ty is the Grayslake Itan, the clan’s leader, and the little werebear is going home with him… Unless it isn’t. It’s her smile. If she’d stop smiling and being gorgeous, his inner-bear would support him and Ty would get his way. But the beast wants to make their woman happy, so it’s perfectly content to let her do as she pleases. Then things change. Threats arise, danger comes close, and Ty demands she return to his den. No ifs, ands, or mates about that. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher plans to follow the autumn sun on an epic road trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn't get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been - the town where his father was born. He thinks, what's one extra day? He takes the detour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very same moment, close by, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians are trying to get to New York City to sell a treasure. They are stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. It's a strange place ... but it's all there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning in the city clerk's office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He's told no one named Reacher ever lived in that town. He knows his father never went back. Now he wonders, was he ever there in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins another nail-biting, adrenaline-fuelled adventure for Reacher. The present can be tense, but the past can be worse. That's for damn sure.</description>

  <description>Reacher takes a stroll through a small Wisconsin town and sees a class ring in a pawn shop window: West Point 2005. A tough year to graduate: Iraq, then Afghanistan. The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not?&lt;p&gt;So begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain. Powerful forces are guarding a vast criminal enterprise. Some lines should never be crossed. But then, neither should Reacher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;6 hrs 24 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthropologist Jillian Ramsay's career has taken a turn south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned that technology is about to chase mythological creatures out into the open (how long can Sasquatch stay hidden from Google maps?), the League for Interspecies Cooperation is sending Jillian to Louisiana on a fact-finding mission. While the League hopes to hold on to secrecy for a little bit longer, they're preparing for the worst in terms of human reactions. They need a plan, so they look to Mystic Bayou, a tiny town hidden in the swamp where humans and supernatural residents have been living in harmony for generations. Mermaids and gator shifters swim in the bayou. Spirit bottles light the front porches after twilight. Dragons light the fires under crayfish pots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian's first assignment for the League could be her last. Mystic Bayou is wary of outsiders, and she has difficulty getting locals to talk to her. And she can't get the gruff town sheriff, Bael Boone, off of her back or out of her mind. Bael is the finest male specimen she's seen in a long time, even though he might not be human.

  <description>Real estate mogul werewolf Rafe Denali didn’t get where he is in life by being a pushover. When sexy she-wolf Jade Ashton nearly drowns in the surf outside his beach house, he knows better than to bring her into his home and his heart. But there’s something about her that brings out his strongest instincts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rafe has good reason to be suspicious. Jade Ashton and her baby son are pawns in an evil wolf’s fatal plan. How can Jade betray the gorgeous man who rescued her? But if she doesn’t, her baby will die, and her own life hangs in the balance…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the truth, Rafe is going to have to gain Jade’s trust.

  <description>Obviously psychic Sebastian Donovan was a fraud, but fiercely protective Mary Ellen Sutherland was desperate to find a missing baby and had run out of leads. So, reluctantly, the skeptical private investigator agreed to enlist Sebastian's help. Soon she had to admit - grudgingly - that this man had some pretty remarkable gifts. Especially his extraordinary ability to penetrate her tough facade and awaken her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A classic novel from the enchanting series The Donovan Legacy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the phenomenal Nora Roberts could have created the remarkable Donovan clan. Fascinating and irresistible, the mysterious Donovan cousins share a secret that's been handed down through generations -- a secret that sets them apart from ordinary beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Captivated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His interest in her was purely professional . . . Or so he told himself. Nash Kirkland had sought out the alluring Morgana Donovan to help him research his latest screenplay, though the hardheaded skeptic didn't believe for a minute she was what she professed to be. But, as Morgana revealed herself to him, Nash found himself falling under her bewitching spell. Nash had never trusted his feelings and always kept them in check. So how could he be sure the irresistible passion he felt for Morgana was real and not just some conjurer's trick?</description>

  <description>There’s only one way to win this game: break the rules. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halle Shifters, Book 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James “Barney” Barnwell is losing his ever-loving mind. Between the threat to the white shifters and a riddle he’s been ordered to solve, he can actually go for ten whole minutes without thinking about Heather, the woman destined to be his mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as he burns to get the redhead under him, the safest place for her is far away from him. If the bad guys catch the barest hint of her scent on his skin, she’ll become a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way Heather sees it, the quicker she helps the stubborn Bear solve the riddle, the quicker he’ll bite her—literally. But when she’s hurt while protecting her cousin from an attack, she finds herself right where Barney never wanted her: smack dab in the middle of the investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it or not, Barney is forced to bring her fully into his crazy world. With his mate’s life in his hands, he’s in a race against time to solve this maddening riddle before the enemy discovers that the Hunter has finally been caught by love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br /&gt;This book contains explicit sex, graphic language, lots of questions and maybe even some answers. Remember: Fox holds the key.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Together but unbound, they must learn what it means to love completely, in the latest novel from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Wild Wolf&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cement the leadership of his North Carolina Shiftertown, Bowman O’Donnell agreed to a “mating of convenience.” Two powerful wolf shifters, he and Kenzie keep the pack in order and are adored by all. Bowman would do anything to protect Kenzie, for in each other’s arms they’ve found far more than friendship. But as strong as their attachment is, they still haven’t formed the elusive mate bond—the almost magical joining of true mates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with a monster ravaging the countryside and threatening the Shiftertown community, some in the pack fear that a pair without a true mate bond isn’t strong enough to lead. Bowman and Kenzie will have to rely on their instinctive trust in one another to save their Shifters—and the ensuing battle will either destroy them or give them the chance to seize the love they’ve always craved.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the latest Shifters Unbound novel, a man has resigned himself to a life half lived. But a beautiful, courageous woman has him longing for something more…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham McNeil knows that his pack is unruly, but he’s not sure he can take the next step toward Shiftertown stability—choosing a new mate. After losing his mate and son long ago, Graham has worked hard to keep his heart in check. And even if he was inclined to bind himself again, his girlfriend, Misty, is human—a fact that won’t sit well with Graham’s old-fashioned wolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Graham is up against a new enemy, one who could spell danger and death to all of Shiftertown. Graham must now defend his leadership and save Misty, the woman he has grown to love—before Shiftertown is pulled into an all-out war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When two hearts speak as one, no words are needed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Williams has waited four long years for her mate to acknowledge her. Time and again he has turned her away for being too young, even when she was hospitalized, recovering from a beating that left lingering after effects. Now that he’s been turned into a Wolf, his mating instincts are kicking in big time. Chloe has to decide if it’s worth risking her heart yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years older than Chloe and dealing with issues she knows nothing about, veterinarian James Woods is about ready to howl in frustration. He’s been drawn to Chloe since she was a radiant nineteen-year-old college student, but the age difference held him back from making a move on her. Now his Wolf wants what’s his, and Jim is finally in a place where he can claim her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between meddling mothers, Hunter brothers, and a mystery that threatens to end Chloe’s life, they might find an opportunity to tell each other just how they feel. Or find themselves separated by more than just misunderstood words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains explicit sex, graphic language, and two people who finally get their damn act together.</description>

  <description>The man who made me into a werewolf turned me into a cold-blooded killer, but he went too far the night he tried to force me to murder my own sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his death, the bonds that tied me to him were broken, but I had no idea that my nightmare wasn't over--or that the man of my dreams might find me when I least expected him. Noah Longtail might be everything I ever needed, but this handsome federal agent can either send me to hell or be the angel that saves my soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only shot at redeeming myself and clearing my name is to turn state's evidence. Stashed away in a safe house with only Noah for company, it's all I can do to avoid the temptation of his chiseled body and perfect mouth. My only goal is to get through this with my life intact, but the Wolf Brotherhood won't stop until all of the loose ends are tied up. That means I'm not safe. And neither is my sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They'll stop at nothing to take us out, but I'm tired of being their victim. Those biker sonsabitches have no idea what's about to hit them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They've messed with the wrong bitch this time.​​​​​​​&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***This is Book 3 of Meg Ripley’s sizzling paranormal romance series, Packs Of The Pacific Northwest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Claimed By The Wolf Brotherhood &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Werewolf Baby Daddy &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: The Wolf Pack's Revenge &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is intended for readers age 18 and over.

  <description>Sera Simpson’s fears become a reality when she learns that her sister Aiza has perished in a tragic accident. The case is quickly closed, but Sera’s instincts tell her that there is more to her sister’s untimely demise than meets the eye. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It turns out that Aiza had a strange connection to the Wolf Brotherhood, a local gang of criminal werewolves. Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, Sera searches Portland for any clue that will shed light on the question. What she finds instead might be an even greater boon: Seth, a gorgeous wolf who wants to help her--in more ways than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seth is also on the hunt for members of the Wolf Brotherhood after two of his pack mates have gone missing. When he suggests that he and Sera combine forces in their search efforts, neither could ever dream that it would be the spark that ignites the raging fire burning between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This werewolf unlocks her deepest desires and has the skill and prowess to make her forget all of her troubles with a single touch. He’s like a drug, and she finds herself craving more and more. He makes her head spin and her deliciously curvy body ache for his love, and after a lust-fueled night of passion, Sera becomes pregnant with his pup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sera isn’t going to give up her search for answers, though. With Seth’s help, she vows to get to the bottom of the mystery once and for all. But can they find the answers they seek before the Brotherhood finds them? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is intended for readers age 18 and over. It contains mature situations and language that may be objectionable to some readers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Determined to make a name for herself, Aiza Simpson decides to purchase the neighborhood tavern that she’s been working at for years. When Portland’s nefarious werewolf biker pack, The Wolf Brotherhood, threatens to stake their claim on Aiza’s tavern, she vows to defend what’s rightfully hers—no matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Aiza might be biting off more than she can chew. Although she’s a tough wolf who can stand her own, she has no idea what dangers the Wolf Brotherhood have in store for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her maker—and lover—Dwight is the only person she can turn to for help. There’s something about the fire in his touch that makes her troubles melt away; something about his alluring gaze that makes him irresistible, but Aiza isn’t sure that she can fully trust him—he is, after all, a member of the Wolf Brotherhood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Dwight conjures up a plan to stage her death and save her from the Brotherhood’s inevitably brutal wrath, Aiza resists at first, but quickly realizes that she’s all out of options. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Aiza trust him to protect her territory and save her life? Or is he only using her to further his own ambitions? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***This is the first book of Meg Ripley’s sizzling paranormal romance series, Packs Of The Pacific Northwest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Claimed By The Wolf Brotherhood &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Werewolf Baby Daddy &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Coming June 2016! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is intended for readers age 18 and over. It contains mature situations and language that may be objectionable to some readers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>To win a frightened heart, you have to bare your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any woman would be eager to be Ryan Williams’s mate. Any woman but Glory Walsh. The sexy bear shifter is beautiful, strong and persistent, she’ll give him that. But Glory’s past taught her one simple truth: people leave. She can’t get past the fact he left her once before. Okay, so he had a good reason, and he did come back. Try convincing her emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Glory finally agrees to a date, Ryan feels like shouting hallelujah. He only left his mate to hunt down the man who’d shot her, but convincing the stubborn woman she has a permanent place at his side is tougher than he thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their date takes a turn for the bizarre when Glory thanks Ryan for the series of romantic gifts—gifts Ryan never sent. It seems her past is coming back to bite her, and before it has a chance to sink its teeth in and tear her out of his life, Ryan will have to bare it all, right down to his soul, to protect the woman he loves. Even from herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This title contains explicit sex, graphic language, a blue-haired heroine, and a hero who isn’t afraid to get all kinds of naked.</description>

  <description>To save the woman he loves, he must push his gifts to the brink. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halle Shifters, Book 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julian DuCharme, a rare Spirit Bear with legendary healing powers, is finally free from the threat of death, finally free to claim his mate—but she’s not having it. While his Bear screams it’s time to mate, the love of his life wants to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding his Bear in check while convincing her he’s not out to control her won’t be easy. She’s stubborn and a closeted geek—in other words, perfect for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia “Cyn” Reyes, owner of Living Art Tattoos, thinks Julian is the hottest thing on two legs. That doesn’t mean she’s going to roll over for his masculine charm. She watched her mother flounder when her father passed away, and she’s determined to never lose herself to someone else. Not even a man who would jump the moon for her, if she asked that of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the women of Living Art are targeted by a killer, Julian doesn’t think twice about pouring out his last drop of power &lt;br /&gt;to keep Cyn safe. But it’s Cyn who’ll give up everything—her independence, even her humanity—to keep a terrifying vision &lt;br /&gt;from coming true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This novel contains explicit sex, graphic language, a tattooed heroine and the Bear who loves her. Maybe he’ll finally convince her to tattoo him with “Property of Cyn”.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An exceptional storyteller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr beautifully captures the emotionally charged, complex dynamics that come with being part of any family. Readers will laugh and shed a few tears as they discover what it means to be loved, supported and accepted by the people who mean the most.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having left the military, Dakota Jones is at a crossroads in his life. With his elder brother and youngest sister happily settled in Sullivan’s Crossing, he shows up hoping to clear his head before moving on to his next adventure. But, like every visitor to the Crossing, he’s immediately drawn to the down-to-earth people and the seemingly simple way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dakota is unprepared for how quickly things get complicated. As a newcomer, he is on everyone’s radar—especially the single women in town. While he enjoys the attention at first, he’s really only attracted to the one woman who isn’t interested. And spending quality time with his siblings is eye-opening. As he gets to know them, he also gets to know himself and what he truly wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all the Jones siblings gather for a family wedding, the four adults are drawn together for the first time in a way they never were as children. As they struggle to accept each other, warts and all, the true nature and strength of their bond is tested. But all of them come to realize that your family are the people who see you for who you really are and love you anyway. And for Dakota, that truth allows him to find the home and family he’s always wanted.</description>

  <description>The highly anticipated sequel to #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr's What We Find transports readers back to Sullivan's Crossing. The rustic campground at the crossroads of the Colorado and Continental Divide trails welcomes everyone—whether you're looking for a relaxing weekend getaway or a whole new lease on life. It's a wonderful place where good people face their challenges with humor, strength and love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sierra Jones, Sullivan's Crossing is meant to be a brief stopover. She's put her troubled past behind her but the path forward isn't yet clear. A visit with her big brother Cal and his new bride, Maggie, seems to be the best option to help her get back on her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to burden or depend on anyone, Sierra is surprised to find the Crossing offers so much more than a place to rest her head. Cal and Maggie welcome her into their busy lives and she quickly finds herself bonding with Sully, the quirky campground owner who is the father figure she's always wanted. But when her past catches up with her, it's a special man and an adorable puppy who give her the strength to face the truth and fight for a brighter future. In Sullivan's Crossing Sierra learns to cherish the family you are given and the family you choose.</description>

  <description>Gerri can't decide what's more devastating: learning her rock-solid marriage has big cracks, or the anger she feels as she tries to repair the damage. Always the anchor for friends and her three angst-ridden teenagers, it's time to look carefully at herself. The journey for Gerri and her family is more than revealing—it's transforming.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Andy doesn't have a great track record with men, and she's come to believe that for her a lasting love is out of reach. When she finds herself attracted to her down-to-earth, ordinary contractor—a man without any of the qualities that usually appeal to her—she questions everything she thought she wanted in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonja's lifelong pursuit of balance is shattered when her husband declares he's through with her New Age nonsense and walks out. There's no herbal tonic or cleansing ritual that can restore her serenity—or her sanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously, it's BJ, the reserved newcomer to Mill Valley, who steps into their circle and changes everything. The woman with dark secrets opens up to her neighbors, and together they get each other back on track, stronger as individuals and unfaltering as friends.</description>

  <description>It's the twenty-fifth century, and advances in technology have redefined life itself. A person's consciousness can now be stored in the brain and downloaded into a new body (or "sleeve"), making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Onetime U.N. Envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Resleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats existence as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Trouble comes in bunches for Stephanie Plum. First, professional grave robber and semi-professional loon, Simon Diggery, won’t let her take him in until she agrees to care for his boa constrictor, Ethel. Stephanie’s main qualification for babysitting an extremely large snake is that she owns a stun gun—whether that’s for use on the wandering serpent or the petrified neighbors remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events take a dark turn when headless bodies start appearing across town. At first, it’s just corpses from a funeral home and the morgue that have had the heads removed. But when a homeless man is murdered and dumped behind a church Stephanie knows that she’s the only one with a prayer of catching this killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all that’s not enough, Diesel’s back in town. The 6-foot-tall, blonde-haired hunk is a man who accepts no limits—that includes locked doors, closed windows and underwear. Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli isn’t pleased at this unexpected arrival nor is Ranger, the high-powered security consultant who has his own plans for Stephanie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual Jersey’s favorite bounty hunter is stuck in the middle with more questions than answers. What’s the deal with Grandma Mazur’s latest online paramour? Who is behind the startling epidemic of mutilated corpses? And is the enigmatic Diesel’s sudden appearance a coincidence or the cause of recent deadly events?</description>

  <description>He loves to HUG and SQUEEZE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Bitten Point, where a big bad snake dotes on his itty-bitty dog. Got a problem with it? Then speak to his fist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don’t mock Constantine’s dog. Princess might weigh only six and a half pounds, but she’s tough—so watch your ankles. Be warned, if she doesn’t like you then neither will Constantine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except he kinds of likes Aria, even though Princess would prefer to bury her in a hole. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Could it be because Aria has secrets? Lots of them, and they all have to do with the danger stalking Bitten Point. People are missing, and some have turned up dead. Monsters are roaming and not just the swamp at night but the streets too. At the heart of the mystery is a bite-sized woman, a woman Constantine wants to hug tightly in his coils and…keep forever? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A cold-blooded snake, Constantine can’t help but crave the warmth that is Aria, but can he keep her out of mortal danger long enough to make her his mate?</description>

  <description>Are you ready for a grizzly kind of love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mother would have beaten him to within an inch of his life, if she knew Travis had the hots for the town doctor, but he couldn't help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jess, a redhead with a few years on him, was his soulmate. His inner grizzly knew it. He knew it. Suspected she did as well. But he did have one dilemma standing in his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing Travis was tenacious. Even if he has to travel half a continent, and brave some hot sands, subsist on crappy food and survive attempts on his life he won't give up until he wins her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or dies trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess made a mistake. She married too young, to the wrong man. Problem is, hawks mate for life, and murder is against the law. To add more insult to the situation, her mate won't even attempt to be a husband. It seems he isn't interested in keeping his vows, nor is he coming home anytime soon, so when the chance arises to confront him, she takes it. However facing him changes nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddie doesn't want her...but Travis does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh how she wants him too. Wants and yet can't have him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, her marital problems aren't the only issue. Their pursuit of the nefarious being behind the attacks on their town is being sabotaged by treachery. When Jess and Travis barely survive an ambush, she can no longer deny her love for the rascally bear. But will they survive enough to see if it's possible for her to rectify a wrong and take him as her mate?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What's a bear to do when a human has a polar-izing effect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vicky accidentally slides into the side of a polar bear, she doesn't expect to fall in love. Eaten yes, perhaps used as a chew toy, but become the object of a bear's affection and lust?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazy! Almost as crazy as the fact the polar bear turns out to be a man. A sexy man. A man who growls, and roars and does everything he can to chase her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene only has one thing on his mind, vengeance, until Vicky crashes into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Gene. After the pain and betrayal he suffered in the war all he wants is revenge against the brothers who left him behind. But he's confused when instead of wanting to punish him for his evil acts, they offer him forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who does that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that weren't annoying enough, the cutest geek he ever met--with caramel kissed skin and wearing the sexiest dark rimmed glasses--won't leave him alone. Or more like, he can't seem to stop following her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it isn't just because someone is out to hurt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants her. But does he want her more than vengeance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Kodiak Point where the wildlife might wear clothes, but animal instinct rules the heart.</description>

  <description>Don't &lt;b&gt;moose&lt;/b&gt; with his fox!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bullheaded moose doesn't stand a chance when a fox decides to make him her mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boris left to defend his country still a boy. He came back a changed man. A damaged man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jan still wants him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man of few words, Boris has a firm way of saying No, but this determined vixen knows he's her mate. Despite some less than subtle overtures, Jan has not had much success in getting her bullheaded moose to notice her, but all that changes when her life is put in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the damaged soldier keeps finding excuses to come to her rescue, but as far as Jan is concerned, her mate is the one in need of saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take some subtle maneuvering to outfox her moose into admitting he loves her, but this wily vixen is more than ready for the challenge. And if that doesn't work, momma's offered to loan her the shot gun used for her own engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Kodiak Point, where the wildlife might wear clothes, but animal instinct rules the heart.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN B00LNJ4ABC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He might growl, but she’s not afraid to bite.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands full taking care of his clan, the last thing this Kodiak bear needs is a woman poking her cute little nose into his affairs. But when she refuses to back down—and shows the courage to stand up to him—he can’t resist the allure of a curvy city girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’s mine. &lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when a rival clan thinks to use her to force his paw, he’ll show them why you never piss off a Kodiak, or threaten what’s his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tammy is convinced men are all scum, even gorgeous ones like Reid Carver. She knows he’s hiding something. Something big. She just never expected a real freaking bear hid underneath all those muscles. But when the truth comes out and he tries to scare her off with a roar, she shows him not just bears have bite.</description>

  <description>She might think she’s captured the wolf, but in the end, he’ll take her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brody is a soldier who misses the excitement of the military and its missions. He retired to work as clan beta in Kodiak Point. Talk about boring, until he’s captured by a foreign enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Him, a prisoner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for long. This wolf will do anything in order to get away–even if it involves seduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First step in plotting his escape: pretend interest in a woman. But Layla isn’t just any woman. She’s special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not human. Not shifter. He doesn’t know what this exotic lady is other than his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prisoner for years, Layla isn’t sure what to make of the enemy who shares a cell with her. He promises her hope, but that would involve trust. Despite her doubts, she can’t help but be drawn to him. Unacceptable which means she does her best to drive him nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working together, can they escape the clutches of the enemy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And do they dare fall in love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Kodiak Point, where the wildlife might wear clothes, but animal instinct rules the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A killer with a white picket fence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suburbia, a great place for a man with secrets to hide--while investing in some solid real estate. The biggest drawback?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, a neighbor with sexy curves and a bright smile. Good thing she's not his type. Single moms with annoying exes are on the do-not-date list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calvin wants to; it's just not happening. He can't help but find himself drawn to the chaos next door. And when danger threatens his suburban lifestyle, this assassin doesn't hesitate to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killing people is easy. Domestication, on the other hand, terrifies him.</description>

  <description>Let's get one thing straight - Ivy Wilde is not a heroine. In fact, she's probably the last witch in the world who you'd call if you needed a magical helping hand, regardless of her actual abilities. If it were down to Ivy, she'd spend all day every day on her sofa where she could watch TV, munch junk food and talk to her feline familiar to her heart's content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when a bureaucratic disaster ends up with Ivy as the victim of a case of mistaken identity, she's yanked very unwillingly into Arcane Branch, the investigative department of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Her problems are quadrupled when a valuable object is stolen right from under the Order's noses. It doesn't exactly help that she's been magically bound to Adeptus Exemptus Raphael Winter. He might have piercing sapphire eyes and a body which a cover model would be proud of but, as far as Ivy's concerned, he's a walking advertisement for the joyless perils of too much witch-work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if he makes her go to the gym again, she's definitely going to turn him into a frog.</description>

  <description>I am literally going to kill my mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say I have mommy issues is putting it mildly. The woman who abandoned me has a lot of nerve to just saunter back into my life without warning and drop a bombshell of atomic proportions. I tried to kill her as a way of resolving my inner Freudian issues, but my damned boyfriends stopped me. Spoilsports. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if wanting to strangle my birth mother isn’t enough, once again, someone is messing with my life and a new player steps in to save me. Did I mention my dark knight is tall, gorgeous, and fanged? Just don’t tell my lovers because apparently they’re not willing to share me with the undead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final showdown with the mysterious figure—also known as the major pain in my ass—fast approaches. I don’t care how powerful they are. They screwed up big time when they took something precious of mine. It’s never a good idea to piss off this princess of Hell because revenge is my middle name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust into the final showdown, thankfully, I’ve got more than my fallen angel and kitty at my side. Dark, Fanged, and Delicious is determined to join my group. I’m facing my biggest challenge yet, but don’t worry, with the help of my family and lovers, Hell will have its revenge.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Hi, I’m Muriel, misbegotten daughter of Satan, and once again, my life is in turmoil. The cowled one who tortured me left a curse on my mind, one that makes me afraid. Completely unacceptable, but in order to remove it, I have to do something even worse—betray my beloved by bringing another man into our bed. &lt;br /&gt;As if having to participate in a threesome isn’t traumatizing enough, Hell has frozen over, and as much as I think Hades looks pretty in a blanket of white, the repercussions are severe. It’s a good thing this princess of Hell has two lovers determined to charge my magic in pleasurable ways. &lt;br /&gt;I'll admit it's not easy having nympho magic, but I’m prepared to suck it up—and swallow—for the sake of saving the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: The following is a very adult urban fantasy containing sexual scenes, violence and twisted situations that some people might find offensive. Reader discretion is advised.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It drives my dad nuts I’m such a goody two shoes, but the fact that I’m a virgin makes smoke pour from his ears. See, I’m determined to save myself for love, but daddy dear, more commonly known as Lucifer, just wants me to stop being an embarrassment. Would it kill you to sin a little?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he’ll get his wish because I met an intriguing hunk last night in my bar. Could he be the one? He certainly melts my panties like marshmallows over the coals of Hell, but do I dare trust him? My last boyfriend thought he’d gain infamy by killing me. He’s infamous all right. Dad had him mounted on a wall, his version of modern art titled, ‘Touch my baby girl and die’. Cute in a twisted way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love life isn’t the only thing I've got to worry about. There’s someone threatening the denizens of Hell, and while my daddy says to not worry my pretty little head about it, I am involved because whoever is behind the attacks keeps coming after me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring it. I’m not afraid. Being a princess of Hell means that sometimes I have to grab a demon by the horns and slap it around. It’s what keeps my ass looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing in my life is ever simple, and I blame that on my dad, Lucifer. Assassination attempts, hellhounds, and a rebellion in Hell? A piece of cake compared to the turmoil in my heart. No one ever told me love would be the toughest battle of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Chicago Police Detective Brooke Chandler is keeping a secret… and if she’s not careful, it could get her killed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brooke is no stranger to the supernatural. In Chicago, vampires are just as prevalent as drug lords, and infinitely more bloodthirsty. So when her partner and fiancé dies in a mysterious fire while chasing down a lead in Salem, she suspects something dark and otherworldly is at play. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blessed with the ability to see into the past by touching inanimate objects, Brooke transfers to the Salem PD, hoping her talent will help her get to the bottom of things. Between dodging assassination attempts and being stonewalled at every turn, the going is tough. Add in a mysterious fae club owner with secrets of his own and a personal grudge against her, and it becomes nearly impossible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Brooke wants to play in the supernatural sandbox, she’s going to have to roll up her sleeves and get dirty. But how many people will have to die for Brooke to discover the truth about her fiance? And is she even ready to know? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find out what lurks in the SHADOWS OF SALEM by pre-ordering SHADOW BORN, the latest Urban Fantasy hit readers are comparing to Karen Marie Moning and Patricia Briggs.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;b&gt;New York Times bestseller&lt;/b&gt;, Kendall Ryan, comes a sexy new &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tempting and very alpha friend Sterling Quinn is someone I consider off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not just that we're friends, he's also cocky, confident, and British, which means he's a walking aphrodisiac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lately he's been giving me the look. You know the one. When he thinks I'm not paying attention, and his gaze lingers for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we start working together, that's when the sexual tension between us gets so thick, I want to hack through it with a machete. I want to make all these deep feelings I've harbored for him disappear, because there's no way this can end well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines between business and pleasure become irrevocably blurred, and I'm stuck between a rock, and Sterling's very, very hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than keep a level head about our growing attraction, Sterling wants to go all in, showing me just how explosive we can be together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I've been around long enough to know that this British bad boy is more than my heart can handle. I'm not about to be cast aside like yesterday's underwear when he's done having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterling’s never been told no, and he's not about to put his ego aside and play by my rules. But I never thought he'd fight so dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is a spin-off from the HITCHED series, but can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Seven years ago, my world ended.&lt;br /&gt;Seven years later, my new life began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been seven years since Lexi Knight lost her brother in a tragic accident. On the anniversary of his death, her brother's best friend shows up unexpectedly - a man she hasn't seen since the funeral. He is no longer the boy Lexi once knew, but a dangerous-looking man with tattoos and dark secrets. He broke her trust and abandoned her family, yet what he reveals makes it impossible to stay angry. Lexi has been secretly infatuated with Austin since childhood, so finding out he's a Shifter just makes him sexier. &lt;i&gt;Dammit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Cole has returned to the city where he grew up, and just in time. He's lived a hard life these past seven years, and the shadows of his past are threatening to destroy Lexi's family. It's time that she learned the truth about her brother, but there is a shocking twist that Austin never saw coming. Now he must protect her family when her mother and sister wind up in mortal danger. Will Lexi learn to accept the truth about who he is, and can Austin salvage a relationship from the ruins of their past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Destiny will find you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A romance series that will sweep you off your feet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cliffhanger-free&lt;br /&gt;HEA</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Arranged marriage? Check.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Cocky new husband? Check.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a marriage of convenience—one I’m determined to keep strictly professional. I can't be stupid enough to fall for this sexy playboy's charm or advances. I have to be strong, even if he is my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except he has a huge cock with an even bigger ego, and his main goal in life seems to be getting me to stroke both. The arrogant bastard is like sweet, sugary candy for my libido. I know he’s bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But I want to devour every wicked inch of him.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his sexual prowess and experience, I know he’ll be explosive in the bedroom. And since we’re stuck together for the foreseeable future—keeping up this marriage charade long enough to turn the company profitable again—I deserve something to look forward to at the end of a long workday, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;What could one little taste hurt?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Listening time 4 hours 23 minutes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marry the girl I’ve had a crush on my whole life? &lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inherit a hundred-billion-dollar company? &lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produce an heir… &lt;i&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ninety days to knock up my brand-new fake wife. There’s only one problem—she hates my guts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the fine print of the contract? The requirement that we produce an heir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can’t stand to be in the same room with me. Says she’ll never be in my bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’ve never backed down from a challenge and I’m not about to start now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark my words—I’ll have her begging for me, and it won’t take ninety days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the heels of her smash hit and New York Times bestselling SCREWED series, Kendall Ryan brings you HITCHED, a romantic comedy that delivers heart and heat. A NYC playboy turned business mogul has ninety days to win over the woman he's always desired in order to save his father's company. One tiny problem: She hates his guts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With over 1 million books sold, USA Today Bestseller Dannika Dark introduces her next addictive series…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven Black hunts evildoers for fun, but her vigilante justice isn’t the only reason she’s hiding from the law. Half Vampire, half Mage, she’s spent years living as a rogue to stay alive. When a Russian Shifter offers her a job in his covert organization hunting outlaws, dignity and a respectable career are finally within her grasp. The catch? Her new partner is Christian Poe - a smug, handsome Vampire whom she’d rather stake than go on a stakeout with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're hot on the trail of a human killer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. One misstep during her probationary period could jeopardize Raven’s chance at redemption, and her partner would love nothing more than to see her fail. Will Raven find the courage to succeed, or will she give in to her dark nature?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark secrets, unexpected twists, and a blurred line between good and evil will keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the remote Rocky Mountains, lives depend on the Search &amp;amp; Rescue brotherhood. But in a place this far off the map, trust is hard to come by and secrets can be murder...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the captain of Field County's ice rescue dive team, Callum Cook is driven to perfection. But when he meets new diver Louise "Lou" Sparks, all that hard-won order is obliterated in an instant. Lou is a hurricane. A walking disaster. And with her, he's never felt more alive... even if keeping her safe may just kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lou's new to the Rockies, intent on escaping her controlling ex, and she's determined to make it on her own terms... no matter how tempting Callum may be. But when a routine training exercise unearths a body, Lou and Callum find themselves thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse with a killer who will stop at nothing to silence Lou — and prove that not even her new Search and Rescue family can keep her safe forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Marco’s pack is being hunted… but he needs a mate to keep them strong.&lt;/b&gt; Marco Wilding’s pack is being picked off, one by one. The Wolf Hunter’s mercenaries are snatching wolves off the street then dumping the tortured bodies inside Marco’s territory. When they go for a shifter kid, Marco’s patrol is on it—until a beautiful female wolf steps in and kicks the kidnapper’s ass. The delay saves the kid, but Marco can’t stop drooling over this brave, unmated female who mysteriously landed in his lap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only she wants nothing to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Holloway’s life was finally turning around—she was getting her degree and getting out of her mother’s house with its parade of abusive step-fathers. Then her wolf went wild and ruined her life. Now she’s on the run, but her wolf is still out of control. When it once again tries to save someone, this time a kid who was being kidnapped, she gets an offer she can’t refuse—safe harbor inside a shifter pack while she gets her life together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the hot shifter leader with the passionate eyes wants a mate… and wants her to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Julia and Marco race to stop the Wolf Hunter’s men, Julia will have to do more than just tame her wild wolf… she’ll have to decide whether giving up everything she wants will bring her the one thing she really needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;WILD ONE&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the fourth in the Wilding Pack Wolves series. &lt;b&gt;All stories are standalone, but for maximum reader enjoyment, start with the Riverwise Private Security trilogy. &lt;/b&gt;Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha heroes, and sexy halflings.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The police department is no place for shifters… something Kaden knows all too well.&lt;/b&gt; Kaden Grant’s protective instinct serves him well in the Seattle Police Department… as long as no one knows about his past. But when the mayor’s favorite artist is targeted by the local hate-fanatic, he orders protective custody. Kaden’s desperate to land the assignment because any other cop would get the girl killed. If only her wild streak didn’t threaten to bring out his long-buried secret…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terra Wilding’s family is being torn apart, and now the Wolf Hunter is targeting her—all because her photographs bring out the light in the dark corners of Seattle. The only way to keep her baby sister Cassie and the other wolves safe is to leave her mountain refuge and hole up in a small house that feels more like a cage. If only the human cop who’s guarding her wasn’t so hot…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Terra slips away to meet up with a secretive art collector, Kaden’s protective side goes into overdrive. He’s an alpha’s alpha, and he lights a wild heat that threatens to burn them both down. Kaden wants to protect and serve, but can he tame the wildest Wilding before the Wolf Hunter catches them both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;WILD HEAT&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the third in the Wilding Pack Wolves series. &lt;b&gt;All stories are standalone, but for maximum reader enjoyment, start with the Riverwise Private Security trilogy. &lt;/b&gt;Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha heroes, and sexy artists.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Army is in Noah’s past… and he hopes his dark secret stays buried there.&lt;/b&gt; Noah Wilding’s family is being targeted by an anti-shifter hate group—so he took medical leave from the Army to return home and help out. At least, that’s the story he’s told everyone… meanwhile, he’s going undercover to lure out the haters trying to kill the Wilding pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Jones is the lead programmer for WildLove, the new app that hooks up shifters and humans for a night of hot sex and no commitments. Only she hasn’t had a date herself in years… ever since that dark day when her family didn’t protect her when she needed them most. She figures one magical night with a hot wolf will help her finally move on with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Noah swipes right for Emily, she thinks her dream one-night-stand is about to come true. But with a hate group planting car bombs during WildLove hookups, Noah and Emily are on the front lines of love. They have to hunt down a killer before he strikes again… and before they do more than heat up the sheets. Because humans and shifters might get “Wild for a Night”… but they’re not supposed to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;WILD LOVE&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the second in the Wilding Pack Wolves series. &lt;b&gt;All stories are standalone, but for maximum reader enjoyment, they’re best read in order.&lt;/b&gt; Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha military heroes, and sexy female programmers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An Old Flame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie Armstrong has plenty to atone for. The daughter of the most immoral researcher ever to pick up a scalpel, she's determined to use her own brilliance in genetics to repair the damage her family has done to the paranormals. Especially Dante, the first of the phoenixes, the one they call the Immortal. He's been haunting her dreams since she was a little girl, and she's been trying to ease his pain for almost as long. If only he remembered any of it. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dante doesn't know what Cassie's story is. He almost doesn't care. The minute he sees her, all he can think is mine. But there's more to the pretty little doctor than meets the eye. And Dante isn't the only one to notice. He can't trust her, but he can't stay away—and if he wants to learn her secrets, he's going to have to fight like hell to keep them both alive. . .</description>

  <description>Ryder Duncan keeps his secrets. With a twisted scientist starving him in a 10 X 12 cell, it's not easy to conceal the abilities that set him apart from other vampires, or his plans for escape. But survival - and revenge - are worth waiting for. Until the so-called doctor tempts his appetites with something special: a woman, with a soft Southern accent and a scent like flowers. Sabine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabine Acadia didn't volunteer to be dinner. She was kidnapped and tossed into the cage of a monster. A monster with fierce green eyes, a body that speaks of ruthless power--but a touch gentle as a caress. Ryder knows things about her, secrets Sabine needs to learn fast. Because while they might soon escape this prison, she's fighting an urge to set all her desires free...</description>

  <description>Two FBI agents are caught in a merciless vigilante’s crosshairs in New York Times bestselling author Cynthia Eden’s electric Killer Instinct series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lives will be ravaged as two FBI agents confront a mastermind serial murderer in New York Times bestselling author Cynthia Eden’s new Killer Instinct novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheltered in the shadows of the Smoky Mountains is the suspect who’s summoned FBI agent Macey Night’s fears to the surface. Every day that the “Profiler,” a vigilante serial killer, escapes justice is another day she’s reminded of what it is to be a ruthless predator’s prey. Capturing him is a craving deeper than anything she’s felt in a long time. But Agent Bowen Murphy, equal parts sexy and volatile, seems hell-bent on changing that. Working together—needing, living, and breathing each other—they’re entwined to distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowen’s used to operating on impulse: act, don’t feel. Now Macey and the controlled terror behind her beautiful eyes has him rethinking everything, including his rule to never get close to a colleague. He’s willing to fight for a future with Macey, but the consequences of love could be deadly.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Killer Instinct series from New York Times bestselling author Cynthia Eden continues as an FBI profiler tracks a case that resurrects ghosts from his past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-SEAL Tucker Frost knows that the world is full of evil. He saw it in the face of his own brother, Jason Frost, a cold, methodical, sadistic killer. A killer Tucker put down with his own hands in order to save Jason's final victim--Dawn Alexander, the only girl who got away from the infamous "Iceman." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Tucker's up close and personal experience with evil that's made him perfect for Samantha Dark's experimental profiling division in the FBI. And when women start turning up murdered with the same MO used by the Iceman, Tucker is sent back to Louisiana to investigate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years have passed since the night that Tucker faced down his brother...and since he last saw Dawn, his one-time lover. But as Tucker and Dawn grapple with a desire that never died, they must also face the shared shadow from their pasts. Both have the same question--has Jason Frost come back from the dead to hunt again? And this time, will he succeed in killing the victim who got away?</description>

  <description>Savannah Dupree is halfway across the country from her Louisiana bayou hometown, a freshman studying at Boston University on a full scholarship. But academic excellence is only one of Savannah’s gifts. She possesses something even more remarkable than her quick mind and insatiable curiosity for learning. With a simple touch, Savannah can see an object’s past—a skill that puts her life in danger, when her studies bring her into contact with a centuries-old English sword and the secret hidden within the blade’s history: the vicious murders of twin boys by a group of fanged creatures borne of the worst kind of nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all his three hundred years of living as one of the Breed, vampire warrior Gideon never dreamed he’d see the blade again that spilled his young brothers’ lives ages ago on that blood-soaked night in London. Ever since the boys’ deaths, Gideon’s been on a personal quest to rid the world of Rogue vampires, but now he can’t help wondering if the brutal slayings of his only kin was something more sinister—an act perpetrated by an unknown enemy. An enemy who is apparently living in hiding somewhere in Boston. There’s one certain way to prove Gideon’s suspicion, but it will mean using innocent, gifted Savannah to help uncover the full truth—a truth that will shatter everything she knows about herself and the world around her. And with danger closing in from all sides, the passion that ignites between Gideon and Savannah will tempt them to risk their hearts and lives for a love that might just last an eternity…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novella, a prequel to the Midnight Breed series, was previously published in its entirety in The Midnight Breed Series Companion (May 2013).</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author Cynthia Eden’s latest novel, the Last Option Search Team (LOST) returns— and for one agent, the hunt for a serial killer just got very personal . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HE SWORE TO PROTECT HER . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bailey Jones somehow survived her harrowing abduction by the infamous Death Angel. But while her physical scars have healed, she can’t stop wondering about a woman she helped to escape, who simply disappeared. When LOST agent Asher Young is assigned to her case, Bailey instantly feels an attraction to the intense ex-SEAL who seems to be carrying dark secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT KEEPING HIS PROMISE . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asher can’t afford to let his growing feelings for Bailey distract him from his job. Only she can soothe his horrific nightmares, but the last thing he wants is for the demons from his past to ever hurt her. Bailey has gotten past his guard, and the emotions he feels for her—they’re as dark and dangerous as the past he doesn’t want to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COULD COST BOTH THEIR LIVES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When corpses begin surfacing—all marked with the same tattoo depicting the Death Angel’s calling card—Asher must race to stop a twisted killer who wants nothing more than to claim his next prize: Bailey . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Under Fire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Bradley was undercover looking for a story, not a cause. But something about the man they called Subject Thirteen got her involved. The scientists said he was a devil, and they had a decent case: Terrifying power. A bad attitude. And looks that could lead anyone to sin. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cain O'Connor knows the minute he catches her candy scent that Eve could drive him wild. But she's a threat--in a way no one has been for him in years. She's safer away from him, too. But with a powerful conspiracy determined to shut Eve up for good, there's no time to argue. All they can do is trust their instincts--and their hearts. . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Dane welcomes you back to Diablo Lake, Tennessee: a town founded by witches, governed by werewolves and full of secrets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tensions are building in Diablo Lake as the two main rival Packs vie for control, and the town is divided along lines of Pack loyalty. Aimee Benton and Mac Pembry are on opposite sides and he seems to find excuses to spar with her daily. He's infuriating—not to mention charming, gorgeous and oh-so-lickable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mac can't resist pushing Aimee's buttons. She's always been incredibly sexy, and the wolf in him craves a female with fire in her belly. When a heated argument ends with a sizzling kiss and Mac gets a taste of her, he craves more—and she can't seem to get enough of him, either. The forbidden nature of their attraction stokes their desires until they're secretly hooking up whenever they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Mac's clan goes too far, and Aimee shuts him out. She's hurt and angry—but that's nothing compared to the rage Mac is feeling toward his own Pack. A fight is brewing that will plunge the whole town into chaos, and someone will have to cross Pack lines to keep the town's fragile peace from breaking apart for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Overshadowed by the rising threat of the werewolf mafia, Ben and Tegan struggle to stand united. Werewolf Enforcer Tegan Warden has been alone since the death of her mate four years ago. Until she meets Ben Stoner at a local club and she feels something she thought died inside her. Things move very quickly and she finds herself mated to a human man whos not altogether sure he wants a forever kind of love with a woman hes just met. Ben realizes in short order Tegan is not only worth forever love, but a woman who'll stand at his side without tolerating anything other than a full partnership. In the bedroom its another story, as Ben has finally found a sexual submissive with a spark, and Tegan a man worthy of her submission. Together they work toward building a permanent relationship even as the specter of danger from the Pellini Group grows in the world of wolves. All around them, the rising violence threatens the Packs and the only thing they know for certain is one another.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Owen’s an ex-Army bodyguard for a beautiful gaming heiress… and a man with a secret. &lt;/b&gt; Ex-Army Texas boy Owen Harding fears only one thing—his inner beast. A year in Agent Smith’s experimental cages has changed his wolf into something monstrous. But a hate group is hunting the Wilding pack, so Owen’s serving again, this time as bodyguard. If only the girl he’s protecting wasn’t so damn sexy… and completely off limits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova Wilding’s father was assassinated, leaving her a gaming company to run, a new game to release, and a pack full of wolves who want her for a mate… including a beta who’s determined to have Nova and her company. When a bomb goes off in her car, Nova finds herself in her sexy bodyguard’s arms… but he’s absolutely the wrong man at the wrong time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Nova fights to keep her gaming company afloat, and Owen fights to keep her alive, the hate group circles closer and closer… until they both find that falling in love might be the most dangerous game of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WILD GAME is a complete novel with HEA,&lt;/b&gt; the first in the Wilding Pack Wolves series. &lt;b&gt;All stories are standalone, but for maximum reader enjoyment, start with the Riverwise Private Security trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the #1 international best seller &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Spider's Web:&lt;/i&gt; the new book in the Millennium series, which began with Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisbeth Salander - the girl with the dragon tattoo, the brilliant hacker, the obstinate outsider, the volatile seeker of justice for herself and others - has never been able to uncover the most telling facts of her traumatic childhood, the secrets that might finally, fully explain her to herself. Now, when she sees a chance to uncover them once and for all, she enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, the editor of the muckraking, investigative journal &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt;. And nothing will stop her - not the anti-Muslim gang she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the deadly reach from inside the Russian mafia of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudo-scientific experiment known only as The Registry. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, together, are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the most insidious problems facing the world at this very moment.</description>

  <description>Rain is a waitress by day, but when not at the Black Cat she's working hard to make her art career take off. Her paintings are the center of her life until Laurent walks into her cafe. Suddenly she's dealing with a very alpha male pursuing her and the not-so-very-tiny detail that he happens to be a werewolf. Laurent Cole has been the Third in command in the Cherchez Wolf Pack for decades. His life is simple, good--but he knows he's missing something, and when he claps eyes on Rain, he knows what it is. But their coming together is complicated by the past Rain has worked so hard to keep a secret. Laurent isn't about to let anyone do his mate any harm. But the world becomes more complicated every day ...</description>

  <description>Knox and Harper's story continues as the Las Vegas lair - and its two infamous Co-Primes - face their most terrifying enemy yet . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Harper and Knox have overcome just about every evil thing you can think of - from Horsemen of the Apocalypse to dark magic practitioners to Lucifer's insistent belief that he's hilarious. They're looking forward to some well-earned downtime - until Harper is attacked by mercenaries in the middle of her tattoo shop. Worse still, the attackers are trying to take her wings - the ones no one is meant to know she even has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a near miss and once a furious Knox has managed to pull his demon back into line there's only one thing clear - someone knows Harper's secrets and is systematically setting out to destroy her. It seems likely that someone is the third Horseman - but how do they know so much about Harper? It seems the impossible might be true - they have an enemy hiding at the very heart of the lair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To survive Harper will need to embrace power that's darker than she's ever experienced and even Knox can't protect her from everything - though God knows nothing's going to stop him trying. The stakes have never been higher, for if Harper's taken by this new threat, Knox won't be able to stop his demon from taking a vicious pleasure in tearing the world apart . . .</description>

  <description>Defeat the enemy. Win the boy. Live happily ever after. But life "ever after" isn't as easy as it used to be. Harper's gone from being a member of a small demon lair to co-Prime of one of the most powerful lairs in the US with a mate who, though hot as hell, is just a mite overprotective - I mean, you get kidnapped by dark practitioners just once ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one of Knox's demons goes rogue, and in his madness decides Knox Thorne must die. Harper's worried. Knox isn't - at least until he discovers his mate's willingness to get between him and danger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Knox has a new priority: Keep Harper safe ...no matter what it takes. But Harper begins to suspect there's more danger than one rogue demon. It seems the combined strength of Harper and Knox has upset the balance of power in the demon world and there are those who are determined to right that wrong. Because when you move up the food chain, sometimes the other predators just want to take a bigger bite.</description>

  <description>Attacked by werewolves. Mated to the Alpha. Declared a queen. Kari is having an unusual day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Cherchez wolf pack, loyalty is earned, not given. For Andreas, the pull he feels toward Kari cannot be ignored, a physical bond immediate and unbreakable—though Andreas wants to win Kari’s heart as well as her body. But someone isn’t happy about his new mate, and Kari’s just beginning to trust him and the pack when attempted murder threatens their newfound happiness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andreas brings out the deepest hunger in Kari, a sexy, passionate side of herself she never knew was there. And her new life as werewolf queen is turning out to be surprisingly emotional in other ways, as well. The bond she feels with Andreas extends to the others in the pack—others she’s now bound to defend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the pack’s enemies are about to discover, Kari will do anything to protect her new family.</description>

  <description>Nina Reyes is a just barely reformed grifter who has left her past and her criminal record behind. That is until her brother shows up on her doorstep with some rogue werewolves out to kill him. Nina gets further drawn into the web of intrigue when Lex Warden, Cascadia Pack's Enforcer, comes to her for help and she ends up needing his protection. There are missing viral agents, the werewolf mafia, death threats, arson and a whole lot of scorching sex and acerbic wit between them. Welcome to the Northwest and Cascadia Pack.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In Diablo Lake, Tennessee, a town populated by werewolves, witches, and more, magic woven deep into the earth protects the town's secrets from outsiders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Grady left Diablo Lake to get over a humiliating breakup; but her family needs her help, so she's back, in a sublet right across the hall from the guy she's lusted after for years. Jace Dooley is hotter than ever, and their friendship picks up along with massive doses of grown-up chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very scent of Katie sharpens Jace's canines, makes the wolf within him stir. There's nothing more alluring to a Pack Alpha than a sexy female who is so very in charge. She won't be coddled, but if he plays his hand just right she might be convinced to become his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie presents a challenge to Jace's wolf nature, whose chief instinct is to protect. Especially now that she's coming into the magic that is her birthright - and suddenly Jace isn't the only one who's interested in Katie, or the raw power she's just learning to use.</description>

  <description>Werewolves mate for life. For every wolf, there's a mate out there. So Tracy Warden is thrilled when she discovers Nick Lawrence, the sexy Enforcer for another Pack, is her mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes lucky wolves get to double dip in the form of the extremely rare Tri-Mate-Bond. And so it is when Tracy discovers that her Anchor bond with National Pack Mediator Gabe Murphy is far more. Suddenly Tracy finds herself with two alpha males whose hunger for her never seems to wane. But their bliss is marred by the heavy hand of the werewolf mafia whose reach goes very high up indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money laundering, kidnapping, assault and other general mayhem can't mar the intensity of their bond, but it sure can threaten their lives.</description>

  <description>The chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it’s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that’s exactly what happens one cold February evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described “social information reporter,” or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she’d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone’s done the same to her, literally—with a knife to the brachial artery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve didn’t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she’ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn’t want to know…</description>

  <description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Kresley Cole comes this gripping tale of a battle-maddenend warrior driven by revenge and the Valkyrie temptress who haunts his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He Vowed He'd Come For Her...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murdered before he could wed Regin the Radiant, warlord Aidan the Fierce seeks his beloved through eternity, reborn again and again into new identities, yet with no memory of his past lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She Awaits His Return...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Regin encounters Declan Chase, a brutal Celtic soldier, she recognizes her proud warlord reincarnated. But Declan takes her captive, intending retribution against all immortals—unaware that he belongs to their world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Sate A Desire More Powerful Than Death...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet every reincarnation comes with a price, for Aidan is doomed to die when he remembers his past. To save herself from Declan’s torments, will Regin rekindle memories of the passion they once shared—even if it means once again losing the only man she could ever love?</description>

  <description>Reluctant Lauren Dane "This story is connected to the Cascadia Wolves series but is completely stand-alone." Layla Warden had a ten-year plan and it sure as heck didn't include a mate. She had her flashy car and her corner office and all was right with the world until Sid Rosario sat down at her table and turned her life upside down. Sparks fly as the two werewolves flirt over dinner and it's no surprise to either of them when they end up back at his hotel room, naked and sweaty. But Sid is her mate, and they don't figure it out until the bond is sealed. Layla, driven by confusion and fear, heads out of contact while a frantic Sid looks for her. What comes next helps a reluctant wolf find her way to acceptance.</description>

  <description>Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown. Now that story is about to hit the small screen. Even if she wanted to, Aurora can't help getting involved. Her ex, Robin, wrote the TV movie's screenplay and her stepson, Barrett, has a starring role. Then there's Celia--the catty actress portraying Roe--who, by the way, also happens to be Robin's latest squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Celia is murdered and Barrett is accused, the real-life script takes a deadly turn. Between threatening letters, deranged fans and renewed feelings for Robin, Aurora has one goal: catch a killer and make it to the final scene alive.</description>

  <description>What's the world coming to - when you can't relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden? Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department's finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe's friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe's feet. Roe's husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It's only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe's yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 New York Times-bestselling author Nora Roberts comes a novel of a woman who needs nothing, a man who sees everything, and the web of deceit, greed, and danger that brings them together—and could tear them apart . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When professional house-sitter Lila Emerson witnesses a murder/suicide from her current apartment-sitting job, life as she knows it takes a dramatic turn. Suddenly, the woman with no permanent ties finds herself almost wishing for one. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist Ashton Archer knows his brother isn’t capable of violence—against himself or others. He recruits Lila, the only eyewitness, to help him uncover what happened. Ash longs to paint her as intensely as he hungers to touch her. But their investigation draws them into a rarified circle where priceless antiques are bought, sold, gambled away, and stolen, where what you possess is who you are, and where what you desire becomes a deadly obsession. . . .</description>

  <description>DON'T LOOK BACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under siege. That's how Ryker Jones feels. The Lost Bastards Investigative Agency he opened up with his blood brothers has lost a client in a brutal way. The past he can't outrun is resurfacing, threatening to drag him down in the undertow. And the beautiful woman he's been trying to keep at arm's length is in danger...and he'll destroy anything and anyone to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paralegal Zara Remington is in over her head. She's making risky moves at work by day and indulging in an affair with a darkly dangerous PI by night. There's a lot Ryker isn't telling her and the more she uncovers, the less she wants to know. But when all hell breaks loose, Ryker may be the only one to save her. If his past doesn't catch up to them first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Full of twists and turns you won't see coming, DEADLY SILENCE is New York Times bestselling author Rebecca Zanetti at her suspenseful best...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Blood Brothers Novel</description>

  <description>From Academy Award nominee, Golden Globe winner, and star of the new motion picture &lt;i&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/i&gt;, Taraji P. Henson, comes an inspiring and funny book about family, friends, the hustle required to make it from DC to Hollywood, and the joy of living in your own truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a sensibility that recalls her beloved screen characters, including NASA physicist mathematician Katherine G. Johnson, Yvette, Queenie, Shug, and the iconic Cookie from Empire, yet is all Taraji, the screen actress writes of her family, the one she was born into and the one she created. She shares stories of her father, a Vietnam vet who was bowed but never broken by life's challenges, and of her mother who survived violence both in the home and on DC's volatile streets. Here too she opens up about her experiences as a single mother, a journey some saw as a burden but which she saw as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Around the Way Girl&lt;/i&gt; is also a classic actor’s memoir in which Taraji reflects on the world-class instruction she received at Howard University and the pitfalls that come with being a black actress. With laugh-out-loud humor and candor, she shares the challenges and disappointments of the actor’s journey and shows us that behind the red carpet moments, she is ever authentic. She is at heart just a girl in pursuit of her dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cursed to be a jinni for a thousand years, Leila nears the end of her servitude—only to be bound once again against her will. Will she risk all to be human?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in ancient Persia, Leila turned to her house Jinni, Kouros, for help escaping an arranged marriage. Kouros did make it impossible for her to marry—by cursing Leila to live a thousand years as a Jinni herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she can remain unBound, Leila's curse will soon be over. But Ozan Sawyer, a Magi with the ability to See, Call, and Bind jinn has other plans. &lt;br /&gt;Oz needs Leila to help him penetrate Pittsburgh's steel-soaked magic, a juice potent but poisonous to supernatural creatures, in order to find a missing girl with her own mysterious connection to Kouros. Unfortunately for Leila, becoming Bound to Oz may risk more than just her chance to be human once more—it could risk her very soul...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jinn and Juice&lt;/i&gt; is the first in a new series by fantasy writer, Nicole Peeler, set in a world of immortal curses, powerful jinni and belly dancing.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mercy Thompson has found her voice in the werewolf pack. But when Mercy’s bond with the pack—and her mate—is broken, she’ll learn what it truly means to be alone...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Attacked and abducted in her home territory, Mercy finds herself in the clutches of the most powerful vampire in the world, taken as a weapon to use against alpha werewolf Adam and the ruler of the Tri-Cities vampires. In coyote form, Mercy escapes—only to find herself without money, without clothing, and alone in the heart of Europe... &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Unable to contact Adam and the rest of the pack, Mercy has allies to find and enemies to fight, and she needs to figure out which is which.

  <description>It was a stab in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a chilly February night, during a screening of &lt;i&gt;Psycho&lt;/i&gt; in midtown, someone sunk an ice pick into the back of Chanel Rylan’s neck, then disappeared quietly into the crowds of drunks and tourists in Times Square. To Chanel’s best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanel’s blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crime—from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesn’t think it’s coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs. But this killer seems to find inspiration in someone else’s imagination, and if the theory holds, this may be only the second of a long-running series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that Eve and her billionaire husband Roarke have an excuse to curl up in front of the fireplace with their cat, Galahad, reading mystery stories for research. The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murderer’s deranged private drama—and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was broken by the war. She has a secret that will destroy her family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-Marine sniper Jared River left the war, but the war never really left him. He’s a broken wolf who’s only good for one thing now—killing men. And he’s peering down his scope at Senator Krepky, the anti-shifter politician about to ruin the lives of all the shifters Jared loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Krepky is the daughter of the Senator, a good girl with a passion for her father’s politics and who’s earned her way into being his campaign manager. Only problem? She’s secretly a shifter… and the clock is ticking until her own father inadvertently forces that secret into the open, ruining both their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jared’s all set to pull the trigger when he sees something shocking through the Senator’s glass walls—his daughter is a wolf. Jared puts his gun aside to go after the fleeing girl, but he already knows this can only end in one of two ways—either he’ll convince her to reveal herself to the Senator and stop his anti-shifter legislation, or Jared will have to assassinate her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If only she wasn’t making him come alive again…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jared&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the third in the Riverwise Private Security trilogy (all standalone stories, but best enjoyed if you read them in order!). Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha military heroes, and dark family secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AFTER THE RIVER BROTHERS: Look for the Wilding Pack Wolves series to start soon!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;His wolf is out of control. She’s a wild thing that won’t be tamed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ex-Army Specialist Jace River has a lock on his bedroom door, but it’s not to keep anyone out; it’s to keep his nightmares from breaking loose. His wolf is an out-of-control killer, which means he can never risk shifting, never truly be part of his pack, and definitely never take a mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Piper Wilding works for the Army as a civilian, traveling the world for her work in counterintelligence and fighting the bad guys while bedding down the good ones. The best part? It keeps her far from her asshole father in Seattle, the rest of the Wilding pack, and the pressure to take a mate. Settling down isn’t her thing, and after what happened to her mother, Piper vowed she would never be tied down by magic or men again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Jace’s wolf keeps him Sleepless in Seattle, Piper returns home to find her missing kid brother. When she breaks into the River brothers' safehouse, sparks fly and claws come out. Her sexy skills threaten to bring out Jace’s wolf, and Jace’s good-guy hotness reminds Piper how tempting shifter men can be. They’re like fire and gasoline, and as they race to find Piper’s brother, the heat threatens to burn down all their carefully constructed walls. But falling in love has never been so dangerous—and being together means taking risks that neither might survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RECOMMENDED: Read &lt;i&gt;Jaxson&lt;/i&gt; (Riverwise Private Security 1) FIRST! &lt;i&gt;Jace&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the second in the Riverwise Private Security trilogy (all standalone stories, but best enjoyed if you read them in order!).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contains scorching hot shifters, alpha military heroes, and sexy spy girls. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three brothers. Three Secrets. One hope to save the shifters of Seattle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former SEAL Jaxson River would give his life for his brothers and his pack, but if he doesn’t claim a mate soon, he’ll be forced to step down as their alpha. There’s only one problem: Jaxson’s dark secret would kill any mate he claimed. With someone kidnapping shifters off the street—and only Jaxson and his brothers, Jace and Jared, to stop them—now is not the time for his secret to come out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curvy Olivia Lilyfield is a half-witch orphan with a dark secret of her own. She wants to atone for it by doing good in the world, so when she finds a wolf being tortured in an alley, she doesn’t hesitate to help… even though wolves and witches mix like matches and TNT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia’s dangerous magic means she can’t let anyone get too close — but Jaxson can’t keep his hands off her, and his kisses are more than she can resist. As they race to save the disappearing shifters of Seattle, the true danger lies in loving each other. They’re playing with magical fire… and their secrets could end up destroying them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jaxson&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the first in the River Pack Wolves trilogy (&lt;i&gt;Jace&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jared&lt;/i&gt; coming soon).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contains scorching shifter sex, alpha military heroes, and sexy witches. Only readers over 18 should dive into the deliciously hot world of the River brothers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This a previously-published edition of ASIN B014ZHGHYQ.)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout’s gripping new novel, a young woman comes home to reclaim her life—even as a murderer plots to end it. . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Sasha Keaton left her West Virginia hometown . . . since she escaped the twisted serial killer known as the Groom. Returning to help run her family inn means being whole again, except for one missing piece. The piece that falls into place when Sasha’s threatened—and FBI agent Cole Landis vows to protect her the way he couldn’t a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First one woman disappears; then another, and all the while, disturbing calling cards are left for the sole survivor of the Groom’s reign of terror. Cole’s never forgiven himself for not being there when Sasha was taken, but he intends to make up for it now . . . because under the quirky sexiness Cole first fell for is a steely strength that only makes him love Sasha more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someone is watching. Waiting. And Sasha’s first mistake could be her last.</description>
