  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic and living off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: &lt;i&gt;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&lt;/i&gt; His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible union—holy matrimony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse than fire. Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love makes fools of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780062878021.

  <description>Bea is on the run. And then, she runs into Lou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chance encounter sends them on a journey through West Texas, where strange things follow them wherever they go. The landscape morphs into an unsettling world, a mysterious cat joins them, and they are haunted by a group of threatening men. To stay safe, Bea and Lou must trust each other as they are driven to confront buried truths. The two women share their stories of loss and heartbreak—and a startling revelation about sexual assault—culminating in an exquisite example of human connection.</description>

  <description>I’m an outcast and a loner, named for death itself. Fate wasn’t supposed to have plans for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she came back—the girl I once kissed in a thorn-covered chapel in the woods. She came back, and I could no more resist her than I could pry out my own heart. And by some trick of fate, she wants me as much as I want her. The only problem? She also wants the man who owns Thornchapel, Auden Guest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years ago, I did something to Auden, something terrible. He hurt me back the only way he knew how, and so here we are: our hatred seasoned with pain and my loneliness seasoned with longing. The only thing we can agree on is Proserpina Markham, and she wants us to find a way to be together—all three of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Auden wants to earn her as his submissive, then he has to earn me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the discovery of bones behind the altar and the carnal revel of Beltane fast approaching, it’s becoming clear that Thornchapel’s secrets are much deeper and older than any of us could have ever guessed. And no matter how bright and merry a feast of sparks may be, it’s always followed by ashes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And darkness.</description>

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking beneath Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery. But time is running out, and the spirit is only growing stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Cass fails, the force she's unleashed could haunt the city forever.</description>

  <description>In 1872, New Orleans is a city ruled by the dead. But to seventeen-year-old Celine Rousseau, New Orleans provides her a refuge after she's forced to flee her life as a dressmaker in Paris. Taken in by the sisters of the Ursuline convent along with six other girls, Celine quickly becomes enamored with the vibrant city from the music to the food to the soirées and—especially—to the danger. She soon becomes embroiled in the city's glitzy underworld, known as La Cour des Lions, after catching the eye of the group's leader, the enigmatic Sébastien Saint Germain. When the body of one of the girls from the convent is found in the lair of La Cour des Lions, Celine battles her attraction to him and suspicions about Sébastien's guilt along with the shame of her own horrible secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When more bodies are discovered, each crime more gruesome than the last, Celine and New Orleans become gripped by the terror of a serial killer on the loose—one Celine is sure has set her in his sights . . . and who may even be the young man who has stolen her heart. As the murders continue to go unsolved, Celine takes matters into her own hands and soon uncovers something even more shocking: an age-old feud from the darkest creatures of the underworld reveals a truth about Celine she always suspected simmered just beneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a sultry romance and a thrilling murder mystery, master storyteller Renée Ahdieh embarks on her most potent fantasy series yet: &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspecters, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts. In fact, her best friend, Jacob, just happens to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Inspecters head to ultra-haunted Edinburgh, Scotland, for their new TV show, Cass—and Jacob—come along. In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil. Cass isn't sure about her new mission, but she does know the sinister Red Raven haunting the city doesn't belong in her world. Cassidy's powers will draw her into an epic fight that stretches through the worlds of the living and the dead, in order to save herself.</description>

  <description>Deja and Josiah are seasonal best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every autumn, all through high school, they’ve worked together at the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world. (Not many people know that the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world is in Omaha, Nebraska, but it definitely is.) They say good-bye every Halloween, and they’re reunited every September 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Halloween is different—Josiah and Deja are finally seniors, and this is their last season at the pumpkin patch. Their last shift together. Their last good-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah’s ready to spend the whole night feeling melancholy about it. Deja isn’t ready to let him. She’s got a&lt;i&gt; plan&lt;/i&gt;: What if—instead of moping and the usual slinging lima beans down at the Succotash Hut—they went out with a bang? They could see all the sights! Taste all the snacks! And Josiah could finally talk to that cute girl he’s been mooning over for three years . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if their last shift was an adventure?</description>

  <description>When librarian Poe Markham takes the job at Thornchapel, she only wants two things: to stay away from Thornchapel’s tortured owner, Auden Guest, and to find out what happened to her mother twelve years ago. It should be easy enough—keep her head down while she works in the house’s crumbling private library and while she hunts down any information as to why this remote manor tucked into the fog-shrouded moors would be the last place her mother was seen alive. But Thornchapel has other plans for her... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Poe begins uncovering the house’s secrets, both new and old, she’s also pulled into the seductive, elegant world of Auden and his friends—and drawn to Auden’s worst enemy, the beautiful and brooding St. Sebastian. And as Thornchapel slowly tightens its coil of truths and lies around them, Poe, Auden and St. Sebastian start unravelling into filthy, holy pleasure and pain. Together, they awaken a fate that will either anoint them or leave them in ashes… &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;From the author of the USA Today bestselling New Camelot series comes an original fairy tale full of ancient mysteries, lantern-lit rituals, jealousy, money, murder, sacred torment, and obsessions that last for lifetimes... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***A Lesson in Thorns is the first of four books in the Thornchapel series.*** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Gunther Lueschen, a particle physicist, gets pulled through a mysterious portal and transported two hundred years into the future to an exotic underground world inhabited by other humans from earth. Despite the society's advanced technology, the people are unable to find a way to return home. But when Gunther himself develops the technology, it is taken from him by a malevolent force and modified to be a powerful weapon. With the aid of an unlikely mix of companions, Gunther seeks to take back his invention and re-open the portals. Standing in his way are genetically altered soldiers, technologically enhanced humans, and corrupt government officials. Yet even greater than these obstacles are the questions that arise about the nature of truth - questions that challenge the very core of his beliefs. "A thoroughly enjoyable read with great characters and a compelling, suspenseful story propelled by lots and lots of action. For me, the icing on the cake is the enlightening apologetics information masterfully woven into the story." Joe Barruso Emmy Award Winning Director/Producer Keith Robinson has dedicated his life to teaching others how to defend the Christian faith. Since the release of Logic's End, his first novel, he has been a featured speaker at Christian music festivals and churches, as well as appearing as a guest on numerous radio shows. In addition, he is also the Extensions Director of the Creation Science Society of Milwaukee. When not writing or speaking, Mr. Robinson is a full-time public school orchestra director at Indian Trail High School &amp;amp; Academy, he serves as the Principal Violist of the Full Score Chamber Orchestra in Zion, Illinois, and he is a professional freelance violist and violinist in the Southeastern Wisconsin/Northeastern Illinois area. He currently resides in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with his wife, Stephanie, their five children, an old-English sheepdog and a Rottweiler puppy.</description>

  <description>A vibrant, food-themed memoir from beloved indie cartoonist Lucy Knisley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Knisley loves food. The daughter of a chef and a gourmet, this talented young cartoonist comes by her obsession honestly. In her forthright, thoughtful, and funny memoir, Lucy traces key episodes in her life thus far, framed by what she was eating at the time and lessons learned about food, cooking, and life. Each chapter is bookended with an illustrated recipe—many of them treasured family dishes, and a few of them Lucy's original inventions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A welcome read for anyone who ever felt more passion for a sandwich than is strictly speaking proper, Relish is a book for our time: it invites the reader to celebrate food as a connection to our bodies and a connection to the earth, rather than an enemy, a compulsion, or a consumer product.</description>

  <description>This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it--but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures&lt;br /&gt;Words&lt;br /&gt;Stories about things that happened to me&lt;br /&gt;Stories about things that happened to other people because of me&lt;br /&gt;Eight billion dollars*&lt;br /&gt;Stories about dogs&lt;br /&gt;The secret to eternal happiness*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!</description>

      <![CDATA[This was quite enjoyable!! I loved the humor and the amount of DOG content. I also related to some of the more serious topics that Brosh approached and appreciated the inclusion, while still keeping with the comedic style of the memoir as a whole. There were some parts that I felt a little bored...]]>

      <![CDATA[This was very, very meh for me. Like most self help books, a lot of the writing in this comes from a place of privilege that doesn't necessarily include people, say, in poverty, with disabilities, etc. I did like the messages of self love, and trying to not be so negative about myself, the things...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The riveting, powerful memoir of the woman whose statement to Brock Turner gave voice to millions of survivors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford’s campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral–viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways–there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Know My Name&lt;/i&gt; will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.</description>

  <description>Millie Quint is devastated when she discovers that her sort-of-best friend/sort-of-girlfriend has been kissing someone else. And because Millie cannot stand the thought of confronting her ex every day, she decides to apply for scholarships to boarding schools . . . the farther from Houston the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millie can't believe her luck when she's accepted into one of the world's most exclusive schools, located in the rolling highlands of Scotland. Everything about Scotland is different: the country is misty and green; the school is gorgeous, and the students think Americans are cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem: Mille's roommate Flora is a total princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's also an &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; princess. Of Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the girls can barely stand each other--Flora is both high-class &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; high-key--but before Millie knows it, she has another sort-of-best-friend/sort-of-girlfriend. Even though Princess Flora could be a new chapter in her love life, Millie knows the chances of happily ever afters are slim . . . after all, real life isn't a fairy tale . . . or is it?</description>

EVERYTHING!!!<br /><br />I gave the first book in this series 3.5 stars because all though it was fun, fast, and absolutely enjoyable, I was a bit disappointed because I had both thought it would be more of a romance and the love interest had just been kind of dull to me.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

The hand does not belong to Teacher. Who is this strange new Outsider, and what do its creepy murmurings about "mother" portend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter a fantasy realm shrouded in mystery, in a dark fairy tale-like setting for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Ancient Magus' Bride&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a land far away, there were two kingdoms: the Outside, where twisted beasts roamed that could curse with a touch, and the Inside, where humans lived in safety and peace. The girl and the beast should never have met, but when they do, a quiet fairytale begins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story of two people--one human, one inhuman--who linger in the hazy twilight that separates night from day.</description>

  <description>Meet Daisy Winters. She’s an offbeat sixteen-year-old Floridian with mermaid-red hair; a part time job at a bootleg Walmart, and a perfect older sister who’s nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Scotland. Daisy has no desire to live in the spotlight, but relentless tabloid attention forces her to join Ellie at the relative seclusion of the castle across the pond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the dashing young Miles has been appointed to teach Daisy the ropes of being regal, the prince’s roguish younger brother kicks up scandal wherever he goes, and tries his best to take Daisy along for the ride. The crown–and the intriguing Miles–might be trying to make Daisy into a lady . . . but Daisy may just rewrite the royal rulebook to suit herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Internationally bestselling author Mhairi McFarlane delivers a funny, romantic, heartfelt novel perfect for fans of Josie Silver or Sally Thorne, and anyone who loves Bridget Jones! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;You always remember your first love... don’t you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s anything worse than being fired from the lousiest restaurant in town, it’s coming home early to find your boyfriend in bed with someone else. Reeling from the humiliation of a double dumping in one day, Georgina takes the next job that comes her way—bartender in a newly opened pub. There’s only one problem: it’s run by the guy she fell in love with years ago. And—make that two problems—he doesn’t remember her. &lt;em&gt;At all.&lt;/em&gt; But she has fabulous friends and her signature hot pink fur coat... what more could a girl really need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas McCarthy has not only grown into a broodingly handsome man, but he’s also turned into an actual grown-up, with a thriving business and a dog along the way. Crossing paths with him again throws Georgina’s rocky present into sharp relief—and brings a secret from her past bubbling to the surface. Only she knows what happened twelve years ago, and why she’s allowed the memories to chase her ever since. But maybe it’s not too late for the truth... or a second chance with the one that got away?</description>

  <description>Rinn has grown up with the Tea Dragons that inhabit their village, but stumbling across a real dragon turns out to be a different matter entirely! Aedhan is a young dragon who was appointed to protect the village but fell asleep in the forest eighty years ago. With the aid of Rinn’s adventuring uncle Erik and his partner Hesekiel, they investigate the mystery of his enchanted sleep, but Rinn’s real challenge is to help Aedhan come to terms with feeling that he cannot get back the time he has lost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new voice in comics is incisive, funny, and fiercely feminist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The mental load. It's incessant, gnawing, exhausting, and disproportionately falls to women. You know the scene--you're making dinner, calling the plumber/doctor/mechanic, checking homework and answering work emails--at the same time. All the while, you are being peppered with questions by your nearest and dearest 'where are my shoes?, 'do we have any cheese?...'" --Australian Broadcasting Corp on Emma's comic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first book of comic strips, Emma reflects on social and feminist issues by means of simple line drawings, dissecting the mental load, ie all that invisible and unpaid organizing, list-making and planning women do to manage their lives, and the lives of their family members. Most of us carry some form of mental load--about our work, household responsibilities, financial obligations and personal life; but what makes up that burden and how it's distributed within households and understood in offices is not always equal or fair. In her strips Emma deals with themes ranging from maternity leave (it is not a vacation!), domestic violence, the clitoris, the violence of the medical world on women during childbirth, and other feminist issues, and she does so in a straightforward way that is both hilarious and deadly serious.. If you're not laughing, you're probably crying in recognition. Emma's comics also address the everyday outrages and absurdities of immigrant rights, income equality, and police violence.&lt;br /&gt; Emma has over 300,000 followers on Facebook, her comics have been. shared 215,000 times, and have elicited comments from 21,000 internet users. An article about her in the French magazine &lt;i&gt;L'Express&lt;/i&gt; drew 1.8 million views--a record since the site was created. And her comic has just been picked up by &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;. Many women will recognize themselves in THE MENTAL LOAD, which is sure to stir a wide ranging, important debate on what it really means to be a woman today.</description>

  <description>On the edge of town a beast haunts the woods, trapped in the Gray, its bonds loosening…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uprooted from the city, Violet Saunders doesn’t have much hope of fitting in at her new school in Four Paths, a town almost buried in the woodlands of rural New York. The fact that she’s descended from one of the town’s founders doesn’t help much, either—her new neighbours treat her with distant respect, and something very like fear. When she meets Justin, May, Isaac, and Harper, all children of founder families, and sees the otherworldly destruction they can wreak, she starts to wonder if the townsfolk are right to be afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When bodies start to appear in the woods, the locals become downright hostile. Can the teenagers solve the mystery of Four Paths, and their own part in it, before another calamity strikes?</description>

  <description>As seen on &lt;i&gt;Late Night With Seth Meyers&lt;/i&gt;! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;u&gt;Eisner&lt;/u&gt;- and &lt;u&gt;Harvey Award&lt;/u&gt; winning raucous sex comedy that &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine called the &lt;u&gt;Comic of the Year&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Apple&lt;/b&gt; called "inappropriate for sale on iOS devices" returns in &lt;i&gt;Sex Criminals&lt;/i&gt;, Volume Three: &lt;i&gt;Three the Hard Way&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it turns out Jon and Suzie aren't alone ― other people around the world, like them, freeze time when they climax. A self-appointed group wants to regulate and control them through fear and intimidation. Jon and Suzie are falling in love and want their freak flags to fly, but if they're going to fight back they can't do it alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really, isn't that a metaphor for the whole series? That we might all be alone but we're all alone together? I think so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read only one comic with a semen-demon in it this year, please make it &lt;i&gt;Sex Criminals&lt;/i&gt;, Volume Three: &lt;i&gt;Three the Hard Way&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wouldn’t trust most comic creators to turn a sexual awakening into compelling pulp fiction, but Fraction and Zdarsky pull it off masterfully.” –&lt;i&gt;Paste Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Sex Criminals&lt;/i&gt; 11-15</description>

  <description>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>Suzie’s just a regular gal with an irregular gift: when she has sex, she stops time. One day she meets Jon and it turns out he has the same ability. And sooner or later they get around to using their gifts to do what we’d ALL do: rob a couple banks. A bawdy and brazen sex comedy for comics begins here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Sex Criminals&lt;/i&gt; 1-5</description>

But as restrictions tighten on artificial intelligence, Ada feels unsure about her place in the world, and Alex questions being with an android. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this final arc, Alex and Ada struggle against the growing hatred for sentient robots and their human allies. Can they survive what's around the corner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects Alex + Ada #11-15.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

  <description>Laura Dean, the most popular girl in high school, was Frederica Riley's dream girl: charming, confident, and SO cute. There's just one problem: Laura Dean is maybe not the greatest girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from her latest break up, Freddy's best friend, Doodle, introduces her to the Seek-Her, a mysterious medium, who leaves Freddy some cryptic parting words: break up with her. But Laura Dean keeps coming back, and as their relationship spirals further out of her control, Freddy has to wonder if it's really Laura Dean that's the problem. Maybe it's Freddy, who is rapidly losing her friends, including Doodle, who needs her now more than ever. Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnists like Anna Vice to help her through being a teenager in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O’Connell bring to life a sweet and spirited tale of young love that asks us to consider what happens when we ditch the toxic relationships we crave to embrace the healthy ones we need.</description>

The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the nation's fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova's amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling's secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction--and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she's fighting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ruin and Rising&lt;/i&gt; is the thrilling final installment in Leigh Bardugo's Grisha Trilogy.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land, all while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. But she can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her—or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>The illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, where he meets all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, while learning to feel a little better about himself—based on the enormously popular Twitter account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are unique and inventive—bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too&lt;/em&gt; is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all the earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we will all learn how sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

  <description>Combines Issues #5-8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Cox is determined to prove himself in the world of competitive fencing, and earn his place on the Kings Row fencing team, alongside sullen fencing prodigy, Seiji Katayama, to win the right to go up against his golden-boy half-brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tryouts are well underway at King’s Row for a spot on the prodigious fencing team, and scrappy fencer Nicholas isn’t sure he’s going to make the grade in the face of surly upperclassmen, nearly impossibly odds, and his seemingly unstoppable roommate, the surly, sullen Seiji Katayama. It’ll take more than sheer determination to overcome a challenge this big!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the superstar team of C.S. Pacat (The Captive Prince) and fan-favorite artist Johanna the Mad comes the second volume of this acclaimed, dynamic series. </description>

      <![CDATA[Oh man I loved this volume even more than the first. We got to know the characters a little more (I can't help but be so interested in Aiden's character!) and this one was so much FUNNIER than the first!

After getting accepted to the prodigious Kings Row private school, Nicholas is thrust into a cut-throat world, and finds himself facing not only his golden-boy half-brother, but the unbeatable, mysterious Seiji Katayama...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through clashes, rivalries, and romance between teammates, Nicholas and the boys of Kings Row will discover there’s much more to fencing than just foils and lunges.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Here&lt;/i&gt; is Richard McGuire's unique graphic novel based on the legendary 1989 comic strip of the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard McGuire's groundbreaking comic strip &lt;i&gt;Here&lt;/i&gt; was published under Art Spiegelman's editorship at RAW in 1989.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built in six pages of interlocking panels, dated by year, it collapsed time and space to tell the story of the corner of a room - and its inhabitants - between the years 500,957,406,073 BC and 2313 AD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strip remains one of the most influential and widely discussed contributions to the medium, and it has now been developed, expanded and reimagined by the artist into this full-length, full-colour graphic novel - a must for any fan of the genre.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore, and he's sort of got a boyfriend, even if he's kind of mean and only wants to meet up in secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. That is, until the start of January, in which Nick and Charlie are placed in the same form group and made to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Solitaire&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Radio Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a bind up of the first two chapters of Heartstopper, an &lt;a href="http://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ongoing webcomic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The hilarious and wildly popular instagram comic about a world with no men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her startling humor, it’s no surprise that Aminder Dhaliwal’s web comic &lt;i&gt;Woman World&lt;/i&gt; has a devoted audience of more than 150,000 readers, updated biweekly with each installment earning an average of 25,000 likes. Now, readers everywhere will delight in the print edition as Dhaliwal seamlessly incorporates feminist philosophical concerns into a series of perfectly-paced strips that skewer perceived notions of femininity and contemporary cultural icons. D+Q’s edition of &lt;i&gt;Woman World&lt;/i&gt; will include new and previously unpublished material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a birth defect wipes out the planet’s entire population of men, &lt;i&gt;Woman World&lt;/i&gt; rises out of society’s ashes. Dhaliwal’s infectiously funny instagram comic follows the rebuilding process, tracking a group of women who have rallied together under the flag of “Beyonce’s Thighs.” Only Grandma remembers the distant past, a civilization of segway-riding mall cops, Blockbuster movie rental shops, and “That’s What She Said” jokes. For the most part, &lt;i&gt;Woman World&lt;/i&gt;’s residents are focused on their struggles with unrequited love and anxiety, not to mention that whole “survival of humanity” thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Woman World&lt;/i&gt; is an uproarious and insightful graphic novel from a very talented and funny new voice.</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen -- especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'M EMO. <br /><br />This book was so, so, so good. Kristen is definitely one of my new favorite romance protagonists. She's the kind of woman I want to be, even though she's way more tough and brave than I am. I loved that she was so headstrong and witty, that her and Josh always played off of one another....]]>

  <description>Sam Brandis was Tate Jones’s first: Her first love. Her first everything. Including her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During a whirlwind two-week vacation abroad, Sam and Tate fell for each other in only the way that first loves do: sharing all of their hopes, dreams, and deepest secrets along the way. Sam was the first, and only, person that Tate—the long-lost daughter of one of the world’s biggest film stars—ever revealed her identity to. So when it became clear her trust was misplaced, her world shattered for good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years later, Tate, now an up-and-coming actress, only thinks about her first love every once in a blue moon. When she steps onto the set of her first big break, he’s the last person she expects to see. Yet here Sam is, the same charming, confident man she knew, but even more alluring than she remembered. Forced to confront the man who betrayed her, Tate must ask herself if it’s possible to do the wrong thing for the right reason… and whether “once in a lifetime” &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; come around twice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Christina Lauren’s signature “beautifully written and remarkably compelling” (Sarah J. Maas, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author) prose and perfect for fans of Emily Giffin and Jennifer Weiner, &lt;i&gt;Twice in a Blue Moon &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable and moving novel of young love and second chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Unhoneymooners &lt;/i&gt;and the “delectable, moving” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;My Favorite Half-Night Stand &lt;/i&gt;comes a modern love story about what happens when your first love reenters your life when you least expect it…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Helloooo, Internet Land. Bitty here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y’all... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;not be ready for this. I may be a former junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;talented amateur pâtissier, but being a freshman on the Samwell University hockey team is a whole new challenge. It’s nothing like co-ed club hockey back in Georgia! First of all? There’s &lt;em&gt;checking.&lt;/em&gt; And then, there is Jack—our very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the megapopular webcomic series of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Check, Please!: #Hockey&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[I don't know if this series will ever get over a 4 from me, but they've all been a lot of fun! I like how this one in particular gives us side characters that may only be with us for one volume but still worked to flesh them out. The range of women we see represented is especially great!]]>

  <description>From the creator of SCOTT PILGRIM! Lottie Person is a glamorous fashion blogger living her best life in L.A. — at least that’s what she wants you to think. CALIFORNIA SCREAMING finds Lottie putting the past behind her and trying to make the best of a bad situation — her life! Lottie’s new bestie is an emotional roller coaster: first she died, and then she killed someone. Who will Caroline hurt next, and what is her brother Virgil doing here? What secret is Detective John Cho seeking in the desert? Why did Cutegirl ghost her sister? Is Normgirl really going to marry Ashley? And what in god’s name did Sunny ever see in Charlene? These questions and many others may possibly be answered in SNOTGIRL, VOL. 2: CALIFORNIA SCREAMING! IGN calls SNOTGIRL “Fresh and different!” and says “its sheer weirdness, creativity and heart will appeal to fans of SCOTT PILGRIM and SECONDS!” Collects SNOTGIRL #6-10.</description>

  <description>Poignant and captivating, Ignatz Award winner Tillie Walden's powerful graphic memoir, &lt;i&gt;Spinning&lt;/i&gt;, captures what it's like to come of age, come out, and come to terms with leaving behind everything you used to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the same every morning. Wake up, grab the ice skates, and head to the rink while the world was still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weekends were spent in glitter and tights at competitions. Perform. Smile. And do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was good. She won. And she hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten years, figure skating was Tillie Walden's life. She woke before dawn for morning lessons, went straight to group practice after school, and spent weekends competing at ice rinks across the state. It was a central piece of her identity, her safe haven from the stress of school, bullies, and family. But over time, as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the figure skating team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls. It all led to one question: &lt;i&gt;What was the point?&lt;/i&gt; The more Tillie thought about it, the more Tillie realized she'd outgrown her passion--and she finally needed to find her own voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself that strong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were biddable. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her, even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a faerie world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Check out the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; by Liane Moriarty, called “a surefire hit” by &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major HBO® series starring Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The secrets burrowed in this seemingly placid small town...are so suburban noir they would make David Lynch clap with glee...[Moriarty] is a fantastically nimble writer, so sure-footed that the book leaps between dark and light seamlessly; even the big reveal in the final pages feels earned and genuinely shocking.” —&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Reading one [of Liane Moriarty's novels] is a bit like drinking a pink cosmo laced with arsenic... [BIG LITTLE LIES] is a fun, engaging and sometimes disturbing read” –&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes it’s the little lies that turn out to be the most lethal. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A murder… . . . a tragic accident… . . . or just parents behaving badly?  &lt;br /&gt; What’s indisputable is that someone is dead.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who did what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; follows three women, each at a crossroads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest (&lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, a &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Top Ten Book, National Book Award finalist, more than two and a half years on the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the stunningly beautiful instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doerr’s “stunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors” (&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;) are dazzling. Ten years in the writing, a National Book Award finalist, &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent, deeply moving novel from a writer “whose sentences never fail to thrill” (&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was just kind of okay to me. I went in with pretty high expectations, both from the fact that it's a Pulitzer winner and the numerous people who rave about it. Something about it just didn't connect with me for the majority of the novel. The first half was just pretty dull to me, and I...]]>

I met a gorgeous woman. We fell in love. We had kids. We moved to the suburbs. We told each other our biggest dreams, and our darkest secrets. And then we got bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look like a normal couple. We're your neighbors, the parents of your kid's friend, the acquaintances you keep meaning to get dinner with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have secrets to keeping a marriage alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours just happens to be getting away with murder.</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alisha Rai returns with the first book in her sizzling new &lt;i&gt;Modern Love&lt;/i&gt; series, in which two rival dating app creators find themselves at odds in the boardroom but in sync in the bedroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhiannon Hunter may have revolutionized romance in the digital world, but in real life she only swipes right on her career—and the occasional hookup. The cynical dating app creator controls her love life with a few key rules: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nude pics are by invitation only &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If someone stands you up, block them with extreme prejudice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Protect your heart &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only there aren't any rules to govern her attraction to her newest match, former pro-football player Samson Lima. The sexy and seemingly sweet hunk woos her one magical night... and disappears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhi thought she'd buried her hurt over Samson ghosting her, until he suddenly surfaces months later, still big, still beautiful—and in league with a business rival. He says he won't fumble their second chance, but she's wary. A temporary physical partnership is one thing, but a merger of hearts? Surely that’s too high a risk…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

It's me screaming over how good this book is.<br /><br />I honestly don't think I've ever read a book written with such accurate, hilarious, modern 20-something dialogue.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if falling in love meant almost losing everything?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does a moderately popular internet star who never leaves her house look for potential suitors? Online. Tinder, Bumble, Match.com, OkCupid—I tried them all.  My thirty-two-year-old self clicked and swiped her little heart out, leading to more dates than I could count, and more disappointment than I was prepared for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you can relate. Maybe you know all too well the perils of modern dating. But let’s say, eventually, you meet someone. You think to yourself, “Wow, they’re perfect! Take me off the market, put a ring on it, knock me up, the whole enchilada, because they are ‘the one.’” Let’s also say that they “feel the same way” about you. Your life starts to make sense! All the pain, heartbreak, and frustration from past failed relationships was worth it.  Slow clap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how I felt about Milos. He was from Europe, a doctor, wealthy, athletic.  He had an accent &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;a dog.  Milos was textbook marriage material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For him it was “love at first sight,” but for me, it was “anxiety on every date.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something was telling me to run—but for two years, the only running I did was straight into his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I would have listened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s my story of survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Watson and Holmes: A match made in disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Watson and Charlotte Holmes are looking for a winter-break reprieve after a fall semester that almost got them killed. But Charlotte isn’t the only Holmes with secrets, and the mood at her family’s Sussex estate is palpably tense. On top of everything else, Holmes and Watson could be becoming &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than friends—but still, the darkness in Charlotte’s past is a wall between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A distraction arises soon enough, because Charlotte’s beloved uncle Leander goes missing from the estate—after being oddly private about his latest assignment in a German art forgery ring. The game is afoot once again, and Charlotte is single-minded in her pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their first stop? Berlin. Their first contact? August Moriarty (formerly Charlotte’s obsession, currently believed by most to be dead), whose powerful family has been ripping off famous paintings for the last hundred years. But as they follow the gritty underground scene in Berlin to glittering art houses in Prague, Holmes and Watson begin to realize that this is a much more complicated case than a disappearance. Much more dangerous, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they learn might change everything they know about their families, themselves, and each other.</description>

  <description>The last thing Jamie Watson wants is a rugby scholarship to Sherringford, a Connecticut prep school just an hour away from his estranged father. But that’s not the only complication: Sherringford is also home to Charlotte Holmes, the famous detective’s great-great-great-granddaughter, who has inherited not only Sherlock’s genius but also his volatile temperament. From everything Jamie has heard about Charlotte, it seems safer to admire her from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they meet, there’s a tense energy between them, and they seem more destined to be rivals than anything else. But when a Sherringford student dies under suspicious circumstances, ripped straight from the most terrifying of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Jamie can no longer afford to keep his distance. Jamie and Charlotte are being framed for murder, and only Charlotte can clear their names. But danger is mounting and nowhere is safe—and the only people they can trust are each other.</description>

  <description>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most demeaning. This year, there's a ninth. And instead of paper, she's made of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this richly developed fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching her mother snatched by royal guards for an unknown fate still haunts her. Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learns the skills and charm that befit a king's consort. There, she does the unthinkable -- she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.</description>

  <description>On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Over the course of minutes, they would kill twelve students and a teacher and wound twenty-four others before taking their own lives.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan’s mother, has lived with the indescribable grief and shame of that day. How could her child, the promising young man she had loved and raised, be responsible for such horror? And how, as his mother, had she not known something was wrong? Were there subtle signs she had missed? What, if anything, could she have done differently?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; These are questions that Klebold has grappled with every day since the Columbine tragedy. In &lt;i&gt;A Mother’s Reckoning&lt;/i&gt;, she chronicles with unflinching honesty her journey as a mother trying to come to terms with the incomprehensible. In the hope that the insights and understanding she has gained may help other families recognize when a child is in distress, she tells her story in full, drawing upon her personal journals, the videos and writings that Dylan left behind, and on countless interviews with mental health experts.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Filled with hard-won wisdom and compassion, &lt;i&gt;A Mother’s Reckoning &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful and haunting book that sheds light on one of the most pressing issues of our time. And with fresh wounds from the recent Newtown and Charleston shootings, never has the need for understanding been more urgent.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All author profits from the book will be donated to research and to charitable organizations focusing on mental health issues.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Oof, this book. I knew going in it was going to be harrowing, but listening to Sue tell her story is still such a gut punch. I really respected the route that she took here: this isn't just a book centered on herself, trying to make her son seem better, asking for pity. Rather it's a full acknowl...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough's &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind Her Eyes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she’s thrilled she finally connected with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar…who says the kiss was a terrible mistake but who still can’t keep his eyes off Louise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Louise bumps into Adele, who’s new to town and in need of a friend, but she also just happens to be married to David. David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife, but then why is David so controlling, and why is Adele so scared of him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Louise is drawn into David and Adele’s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong, but Louise can’t guess how wrong―and how far a person might go to protect their marriage’s secrets.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young New Yorker grieving his mother's death is pulled into a gritty underworld of art and wealth in this "extraordinary" and beloved Pulitzer Prize winner that "connects with the heart as well as the mind" (Stephen King, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love -- and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention. From the streets of New York to the dark corners of the art underworld, this "soaring masterpiece" examines the devastating impact of grief and the ruthless machinations of fate (Ron Charles, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Calla Fletcher wasn't even two when her mother took her and fled the Alaskan wild, unable to handle the isolation of the extreme, rural lifestyle, leaving behind Calla’s father, Wren Fletcher, in the process. Calla never looked back, and at twenty-six, a busy life in Toronto is all she knows. But when Calla learns that Wren’s days may be numbered, she knows that it’s time to make the long trip back to the remote frontier town where she was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She braves the roaming wildlife, the odd daylight hours, the exorbitant prices, and even the occasional—dear God—outhouse, all for the chance to connect with her father: a man who, despite his many faults, she can’t help but care for. While she struggles to adjust to this rugged environment, Jonah—the unkempt, obnoxious, and proud Alaskan pilot who helps keep her father’s charter plane company operational—can’t imagine calling anywhere else home. And he’s clearly waiting with one hand on the throttle to fly this city girl back to where she belongs, convinced that she’s too pampered to handle the wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonah is probably right, but Calla is determined to prove him wrong. Soon, she finds herself forming an unexpected bond with the burly pilot. As his undercurrent of disapproval dwindles, it’s replaced by friendship—or perhaps something deeper? But Calla is not in Alaska to stay and Jonah will never leave. It would be foolish of her to kindle a romance, to take the same path her parents tried—and failed at—years ago. It’s a simple truth that turns out to be not so simple after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The highly acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Watching Edie&lt;/i&gt; returns with a new novel of dark psychological suspense that explores how those closest to us have the most to hide...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clara's boyfriend, Luke, disappears, everyone believes that he's left her, but Clara thinks she knows the truth. Recent evidence suggests that Luke had a stalker, and Clara worries that he's been kidnapped. Then Luke's older sister, Emma, who vanished twenty years ago, suddenly reappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma wants to help Clara with her search for Luke, but she refuses to talk about what happened--even though it nearly destroyed her family when she vanished. And the deeper Clara digs into Luke's mysterious disappearance, the more convinced she is that the two incidents are connected.</description>

  <description>On Christmas Eve five years ago, Holly was visited by three ghosts who showed her how selfish and spoiled she'd become. They tried to convince her to mend her ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's stuck working for the top-secret company Project Scrooge--as the latest Ghost of Christmas Past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, they save another miserly grouch. Every year, Holly stays frozen at seventeen while her family and friends go on living without her. So far, Holly's afterlife has been miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, everything is about to change. . . .</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, in the olden days, heavy-set middle-aged men would congregate in their elitist clubs, sit in over-stuffed leather chairs, smoke air-choking cigars, and pitch story ideas and plots to each other. Problem was, these stories, many of which found their way into the general social consciousness, reflected the way in which these men lived and saw their world: that is, the stories were sexist, discriminatory, unfair, culturally biased, and in general, demeaning to witches, animals, goblins, and fairies everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after centuries of these abusive tales, which have been handed down--unknowingly--from one male-biased generation to the next, James Finn Garner has taken it upon himself (that's right, yet another man) to enlighten and liberate these classic bedtime stories and retell them in a way that is much more in keeping with the society in which we live today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Politically Correct Bedtime Stories&lt;/i&gt;, then is the fruit of Garner's labors. We'd like to think that future generations of fairy-tale fans will see this as a worthy attempt to develop meaningful literature that is totally free from bias and purged from the influences of a flawed cultural past.</description>

  <description>In 1866, tragedy strikes at the exclusive Windfield School. A young student drowns in a mysterious accident involving a small circle of boys. The drowning and its aftermath initiates a spiraling circle of treachery that will span three decades and entwine many loves... From the exclusive men's club and brothels that cater to every dark desire of London's upper classes to the dazzling ballrooms and mahogany-paneled suites of the manipulators of the world's wealth, Ken Follett conjures up a stunning array of contrasts. This breathtaking novel portrays a family splintered by lust, bound by a shared legacy... men and women swept toward a perilous climax where greed, fed by the shocking truth of a boy's death, must be stopped, or not just one man's dreams, but those of a nation, will die...</description>

Or the perfect lie?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A hair-raising debut, both unsettling and addictive...A chilling thriller that will keep you reading long into the night.”&lt;/b&gt; —Mary Kubica, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Good Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;This is one readers won’t be able to put down.&lt;/b&gt;” —&lt;i&gt;Booklist &lt;/i&gt;(starred review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;b&gt;A can’t-put-down psychological thriller&lt;/b&gt;.” —&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This debut is guaranteed to haunt you...&lt;b&gt;Warning: brace yourself.&lt;/b&gt;” —&lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt; (10 New Thrillers to Read This Summer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;The sense of believably and terror that engulfs Behind Closed Doors doesn't waver.&lt;/b&gt;” —The Associated Press, picked up by &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;This was one of the best and most terrifying psychological thrillers I have ever read.&lt;/b&gt;” —&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace. He has looks and wealth; she has charm and elegance. He’s a dedicated attorney who has never lost a case; she is a flawless homemaker, a masterful gardener and cook, and dotes on her disabled younger sister. Though they are still newlyweds, they seem to have it all. You might not want to like them, but you do. You’re hopelessly charmed by the ease and comfort of their home, by the graciousness of the dinner parties they throw. You’d like to get to know Grace better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might call this true love. Others might wonder why Grace never answers the phone. Or why she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesn’t work. How she can cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim. Or why she never seems to take anything with her when she leaves the house, not even a pen. Or why there are such high-security metal shutters on all the downstairs windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might wonder what’s really going on once the dinner party is over, and the front door has closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From bestselling author B. A. Paris comes the gripping thriller and international phenomenon &lt;i&gt;Behind Closed Doors&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>When Rini lands with a literal splash in the pond behind Eleanor West's Home for Wayward Children, the last thing she expects to find is that her mother, Sumi, died years before Rini was even conceived. But Rini can’t let Reality get in the way of her quest – not when she has an entire world to save! (Much more common than one would suppose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she can't find a way to restore her mother, Rini will have more than a world to save: she will never have been born in the first place. And in a world without magic, she doesn’t have long before Reality notices her existence and washes her away. Good thing the student body is well-acquainted with quests...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of friendship, baking, and derring-do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: May contain nuts.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is definitely my least favorite of the Wayward Children series so far, and kind of disappointing. There was nothing that really invested me in the story. These novellas are known for containing these big worlds in such a little package, and I think this one really hurt because of it. There n...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, discovering her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil war threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

She's in this world that isn't built for her, but she's determined to find her place, and she's not afraid to do what it takes to get that....]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beware of the woods and the dark, dank deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: the new girl. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

  <description>Listening length: 10 hours, 12 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-night stands are supposed to be with someone convenient, or wickedly persuasive, or regrettable. They aren’t supposed to be with someone like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a crazy Vegas weekend celebrating her college graduation—and terrified of the future path she knows is a cop-out—Mia Holland makes the wildest decision of her life: follow Ansel Guillaume—her sweet, filthy fling—to France for the summer and just…play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When feelings begin to develop behind the provocative roles they take on, and their temporary masquerade adventures begin to feel real, Mia will have to decide if she belongs in the life she left because it was all wrong, or in the strange new one that seems worlds away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two girls are forced into the woods at gunpoint. One runs for her life. One is left behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years ago, Charlotte and Samantha Quinn's happy small-town family life was torn apart by a terrifying attack on their family home. It left their mother dead. It left their father—Pikeville's notorious defense attorney—devastated. And it left the family fractured beyond repair, consumed by secrets from that terrible night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years later, Charlotte has followed in her father's footsteps to become a lawyer herself—the ideal good daughter. But when violence comes to Pikeville again, and a shocking tragedy leaves the whole town traumatized, Charlotte is plunged into a nightmare. Not only is she the first witness on the scene, but it's a case that unleashes the terrible memories she's spent so long trying to suppress--because the shocking truth about the crime that destroyed her family nearly thirty years ago won't stay buried forever. Packed with twists and turns, brimming with emotion and heart, &lt;i&gt;The Good Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is fiction at its most thrilling.</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>In this propulsive, twist-filled, and haunting psychological suspense debut perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Room&lt;/i&gt;, a seventeen-year-old girl struggles to remember the role she played on the night her life changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past two weeks, seventeen-year-old Kate Bennet has lived against her will in an isolated cabin in a remote beach town--brought there by a mysterious man named Bill. Part captor, part benefactor, Bill calls her Evie and tells her he's hiding her to protect her. That she did something terrible one night back home in Melbourne--something so unspeakable that he had no choice but to take her away. The trouble is, Kate can't remember the night in question. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragments of Kate's shattered memories of her old life seem happy: good friends, a big house in the suburbs, a devoted boyfriend. Bill says he'll help her fill in the blanks--but his story isn't adding up. And as she tries to reconcile the girl she thought she'd been with the devastating consequences Bill claims she's responsible for, Kate will unearth secrets about herself and those closest to her that could change everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting debut novel that fearlessly plumbs the darkest recesses of the mind, &lt;i&gt;Call Me Evie&lt;/i&gt; explores the fragility of memory and the potential in all of us to hide the truth, even from ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite character Kenji Kishimoto narrates t&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;his gripping companion novella to Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Shatter Me series, set during the explosive events in &lt;em&gt;Restore Me&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ending of &lt;em&gt;Restore Me &lt;/em&gt;left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until &lt;em&gt;Defy Me&lt;/em&gt;, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series, hits shelves in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1979, &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones and The Six&lt;/i&gt; split up. Together, they had redefined the 70’s music scene, creating an iconic sound that rocked the world. Apart, they baffled a world that had hung on their every verse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is an attempt to piece together a clear portrait of the band’s rise to fame and their abrupt and infamous split. The following oral history is a compilation of interviews, emails, transcripts, and lyrics, all pertaining to the personal and professional lives of the members of the band The Six and singer Daisy Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have aimed for a comprehensive and exhaustive approach, I must acknowledge that full and complete accounts from all parties involved has proved impossible. Some people were easier to track down than others, some were more willing to talk than others, and some, unfortunately, have passed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which is to say that while this is the first and only authorised account from all represented perspectives, it should be noted that, in matters both big and small, reasonable people disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth often lies, unclaimed, in the middle.</description>

  <description>The gripping fifth installment in the New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestselling Shatter Me series. Will Juliette’s broken heart make her vulnerable to the strengthening darkness within her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s short tenure as the supreme commander of North America has been an utter disaster. When the children of the other world leaders show up on her doorstep, she wants nothing more than to turn to Warner for support and guidance. But he shatters her heart when he reveals that he’s been keeping secrets about her family and her identity from her—secrets that change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is devastated, and the darkness that’s always dwelled within her threatens to consume her. An explosive encounter with unexpected visitors might be enough to push her over the edge.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fall in love, break the curse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she’s instead somehow sucked into Rhen’s cursed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break the curse, save the kingdom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince? A monster? A curse? Harper doesn’t know where she is or what to believe. But as she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what’s at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.</description>

  <description>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The mesmerizing adult debut from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Leigh Bardugo.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.</description>

  <description>Shane has been doing college all wrong. Pre-med, stellar grades, and happy parents…sounds ideal—but Shane's made zero friends, goes home every weekend, and romance…what’s that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life has been dorm, dining hall, class, repeat. Time's a ticking, and she needs a change—there's nothing like moving to a new country to really mix things up. Shane signs up for a semester abroad in London. She's going to right all her college mistakes: make friends, pursue boys, and find adventure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done. She is soon faced with the complicated realities of living outside her bubble, and when self-doubt sneaks in, her new life starts to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane comes to find that, with the right amount of courage and determination one can conquer anything. Throw in some fate and a touch of magic—the possibilities are endless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final battle is here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people―but at a tremendous cost. Locked within an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve is unraveling with each passing day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Aelin captured, friends and allies are scattered to different fates. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. As destinies weave together at last, all must fight if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the making, Sarah J. Maas's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights to save herself―and the promise of a better world.</description>

  <description>A new adventure about a girl who is fated to wash the bodies of the dead in this companion to &lt;i&gt;Furthermore&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our story begins on a frosty night…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laylee can barely remember the happier times before her beloved mother died. Before her father, driven by grief, lost his wits (and his way). Before she was left as the sole remaining mordeshoor in the village of Whichwood, destined to spend her days washing the bodies of the dead and preparing their souls for the afterlife. It’s become easy to forget and easier still to ignore the way her hands are stiffening and turning silver, just like her hair, and her own ever-increasing loneliness and fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon, a pair of familiar strangers appears, and Laylee’s world is turned upside down as she rediscovers color, magic, and the healing power of friendship.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The highly anticipated third book in Sabaa Tahir's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling EMBER QUARTET.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the Empire and within it, the threat of war looms ever larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blood Shrike, Helene Aquilla, is assailed on all sides. Emperor Marcus, haunted by his past, grows increasingly unstable, while the Commandant capitalizes on his madness to bolster her own power. As Helene searches for a way to hold back the approaching darkness, her sister's life and the lives of all those in the Empire hang in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far to the east, Laia of Serra knows the fate of the world lies not in the machinations of the Martial court, but in stopping the Nightbringer. But while hunting for a way to bring him down, Laia faces unexpected threats from those she hoped would aid her, and is drawn into a battle she never thought she'd have to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the land between the living and the dead, Elias Veturius has given up his freedom to serve as Soul Catcher. But in doing so, he has vowed himself to an ancient power that will stop at nothing to ensure Elias's devotion--even at the cost of his humanity.</description>

  <description>It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.</description>

  <description>In the 1880s, as the European powers were carving up Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million—all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo—too long forgotten—onto the conscience of the West.</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A boy with extraordinary powers. An army of deadly monsters. An epic battle for the future of peculiardom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adventure that began with &lt;i&gt;Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/i&gt; and continued in &lt;i&gt;Hollow City&lt;/i&gt; comes to a thrilling conclusion with &lt;i&gt;Library of Souls&lt;/i&gt;. As the story opens, sixteen-year-old Jacob discovers a powerful new ability, and soon he’s diving through history to rescue his peculiar companions from a heavily guarded fortress. Accompanying Jacob on his journey are Emma Bloom, a girl with fire at her fingertips, and Addison MacHenry, a dog with a nose for sniffing out lost children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ll travel from modern-day London to the labyrinthine alleys of Devil’s Acre, the most wretched slum in all of Victorian England. It’s a place where the fate of peculiar children everywhere will be decided once and for all. Like its predecessors, &lt;i&gt;Library of Souls&lt;/i&gt; blends thrilling fantasy with never-before-published vintage photography to create a one-of-a-kind reading experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The battle for the crown has begun, but which of the three sisters will prevail?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the unforgettable events of the Quickening behind them and the Ascension Year underway, all bets are off. Katharine, once the weak and feeble sister, is stronger than ever before. Arsinoe, after discovering the truth about her powers, must figure out how to make her secret talent work in her favor without anyone finding out. And Mirabella, the elemental sister once thought to be the certain Queen Crowned, faces attacks like never before—ones that put those around her in danger she can’t seem to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fennbirn’s deadliest queens must confront the one thing standing in their way of the crown: each other.</description>

  <description>When first published in 1899, &lt;i&gt;The Awakening&lt;/i&gt; shocked readers with its honest treatment of female marital infidelity. Audiences accustomed to the pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and finds passionate physical love outside the confines of her domestic situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work "quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity." Although the theme of marital infidelity no longer shocks, few novels have plumbed the psychology of a woman involved in an illicit relationship with the perception, artistry, and honesty that Kate Chopin brought to &lt;i&gt;The Awakening&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

But when an unspeakable act leads her to withdraw from everyone she loves, she is faced with a life-altering choice―a choice she must face alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lise stands up―and speaks out―for what she believes in. And when she notices Mellie acting strangely, she gets caught up in trying to save her...all while trying to protect her own secret. One that might be the key to helping Mellie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through Mellie and Lise's journal entries, this powerful, emotional novel chronicles Mellie's struggle to decide what is right for her and the unbreakable bond formed by the two girls on their journey.</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I’m letting my guard down.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of &lt;i&gt;What Happened&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. &lt;i&gt;What Happened &lt;/i&gt;is the story of that campaign and its aftermath—both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.</description>

  <description>Elizabeth Lavenza hasn't had a proper meal in weeks. Her thin arms are covered with bruises from her "caregiver," and she is on the verge of being thrown into the streets . . . until she is brought to the home of Victor Frankenstein, an unsmiling, solitary boy who has everything--except a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor is her escape from misery. Elizabeth does everything she can to make herself indispensable--and it works. She is taken in by the Frankenstein family and rewarded with a warm bed, delicious food, and dresses of the finest silk. Soon she and Victor are inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her new life comes at a price. As the years pass, Elizabeth's survival depends on managing Victor's dangerous temper and entertaining his every whim, no matter how depraved. Behind her blue eyes and sweet smile lies the calculating heart of a girl determined to stay alive no matter the cost . . . as the world she knows is consumed by darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, back at Darrow-Harker School, Beatrice Hartley and her five best friends were the cool kids, the beautiful ones. Then the shocking death of Jim - their creative genius and Beatrice's boyfriend - changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year after graduation, Beatrice is returning to Wincroft - the seaside estate where they spent so many nights sharing secrets, crushes, plans to change the world - hoping she'll get to the bottom of the dark questions gnawing at her about Jim's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the night plays out in a haze of stilted jokes and unfathomable silence, Beatrice senses she's never going to know what really happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a mysterious man knocks on the door. Blithely, he announces the impossible: time for them has become stuck, snagged on a splinter that can only be removed if the former friends make the harshest of decisions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Beatrice has one last shot at answers... and at life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so begins the Neverworld Wake.</description>

  <description>Reclusive Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant to write her story, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career, Monique listens in fascination. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s - and, of course, the seven husbands along the way - Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. But as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with Reid's signature talent for creating "complex, likeable characters" (&lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;), this is a mesmerizing journey through the splendour of Old Hollywood into the sobering realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means - and what it costs - to face the truth.</description>

  <description>Elias and Laia are running for their lives. After the events of the Fourth Trial, Martial soldiers hunt the two fugitives as they flee the city of Serra and undertake a perilous journey through the heart of the Empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laia is determined to break into Kauf—the Empire’s most secure and dangerous prison—to save her brother, who is the key to the Scholars’ survival. And Elias is determined to help Laia succeed, even if it means giving up his last chance at freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces, human and otherworldly, work against Laia and Elias. The pair must fight every step of the way to outsmart their enemies: the bloodthirsty Emperor Marcus, the merciless Commandant, the sadistic Warden of Kauf, and, most heartbreaking of all, Helene—Elias’s former friend and the Empire’s newest Blood Shrike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bound to Marcus’s will, Helene faces a torturous mission of her own—one that might destroy her: find the traitor Elias Veturius and the Scholar slave who helped him escape…and kill them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternative cover edition for ISBN-13: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27774758-an-ember-in-the-ashes?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true" rel="nofollow"&gt;9781595148049&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laia is a slave. Elias is a soldier. Neither is free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the Martial Empire, defiance is met with death. Those who do not vow their blood and bodies to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the destruction of all they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in this brutal world, inspired by ancient Rome, that Laia lives with her grandparents and older brother. The family ekes out an existence in the Empire’s impoverished backstreets. They do not challenge the Empire. They’ve seen what happens to those who do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Laia’s brother is arrested for treason, Laia is forced to make a decision. In exchange for help from rebels who promise to rescue her brother, she will risk her life to spy for them from within the Empire’s greatest military academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, Laia meets Elias, the school’s finest soldier—and secretly, its most unwilling. Elias wants only to be free of the tyranny he’s being trained to enforce. He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwined—and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire itself.</description>

  <description>Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.</description>

  <description>It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>Hailed as "a dreadlocked dervish of words...the Bob Marley of American poets" &lt;i&gt;(Esquire),&lt;/i&gt; Saul Williams is a gifted young poet who is opening up this literary art form to a new generation of readers. Like his writing -- a fearless mix of connecting rhythms and vibrant images -- Saul Williams is unstoppable. He received raves for his performance as an imprisoned street poet in the Trimark Pictures release &lt;i&gt;Slam,&lt;/i&gt; winner of the Camera d'Or at Cannes and the Grand Jury prize at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. The consummate spoken-word performance artist, Williams has also been signed by producer Rick Rubin to record a CD of his poetry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; is a fascinating and unique collection of interconnected poems by this multi-talented star -- and marks the beginning of an incredible and totally original artistic career.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third and final book in the New York Times-bestselling Remnant Chronicles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lia has survived Venda—but so has a great evil bent on the destruction of Morrighan. And only Lia can stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war on the horizon, Lia has no choice but to assume her role as First Daughter, as soldier—as leader. While she struggles to reach Morrighan and warn them, she finds herself at cross-purposes with Rafe and suspicious of Kaden, who has hunted her down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this heart-stopping conclusion to the Remnant Chronicles trilogy&lt;/b&gt; that started with &lt;b&gt;The Kiss of Deception&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;The Heart of Betrayal&lt;/b&gt;, traitors must be rooted out, sacrifices must be made, and impossible odds must be overcome as the future of every kingdom hangs in the balance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times-bestselling author Mary E. Pearson's combination of intrigue, suspense, romance, and action makes this a riveting YA page-turner for teens.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Colour and magic combine in this enchanting new middle grade fantasy from the bestselling author of the Shatter Me series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born as blank as canvas in a world brimming with colour and magic, Alice's pale skin and milk-white hair mark her as an outcast. Because, for the people of Ferenwood, colour and magic are one and the same. And since the disappearance of her beloved father, Alice is more determined than ever to prove herself and her own magical abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do so she'll have to travel into the mythical, dangerous land of Furthermore, with the help of a fiercely annoying boy named Oliver. But nothing in Furthermore is as it seems, and it will take all of Alice's wits to find her father and return him safely home.</description>

      <![CDATA[Truthfully, when I started this book, I was pretty certain it would be a 3 star read for me, just because super strange/whimsical fantasy isn't really my thing, and I haven't had the best luck with middle-grade books either. But Tahereh Mafi's writing simply blew me away. The story was so excelle...]]>

  <description>Achilles, "the best of all the Greeks," son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods' wrath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</description>

  <description>A breathtaking journey toward self-discovery and true love, from the author of If I Stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sheltered American good girl Allyson "LuLu" Healey first meets laid-back Dutch actor Willem De Ruiter at an underground performance of Twelfth Night in England, there's an undeniable spark. After just one day together, that spark bursts into a flame, or so it seems to Allyson, until the following morning, when she wakes up after a whirlwind day in Paris to discover that Willem has left. Over the next year, Allyson embarks on a journey to come to terms with the narrow confines of her life, and through Shakespeare, travel, and a quest for her almost-true-love, to break free of those confines.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It happened like this. I was stolen from an airport. Taken from everything I knew, everything I was used to. Taken to sand and heat, dirt and danger. And he expected me to love him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A letter from nowhere. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Gemma is kidnapped from Bangkok airport and taken to the Australian Outback. This wild and desolate landscape becomes almost a character in the book, so vividly is it described. Ty, her captor, is no stereotype. He is young, fit and completely gorgeous. This new life in the wilderness has been years in the planning. He loves only her, wants only her. Under the hot glare of the Australian sun, cut off from the world outside, can the force of his love make Gemma love him back? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story takes the form of a letter, written by Gemma to Ty, reflecting on those strange and disturbing months in the outback. Months when the lines between love and obsession, and love and dependency, blur until they don't exist--almost.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was such a gripping story. I felt uncomfortable through nearly the whole thing, which I think is the point. The way that it's formatted as a letter only adds to that, as were seeing all of this only through Gemma's eyes, seeing as how her mind copes with this terrifying situation. I do think...]]>

  <description>- Bronze Medal Winner of the Independent Publishers Award 2009 -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 9/11, stories about Muslims and the Islamic world have flooded headlines, politics, and water-cooler conversations all across the country. And, although Americans hear about Islam on a daily basis, there remains no clear explanation of Islam or its people. &lt;i&gt;The Muslim Next Door&lt;/i&gt; offers easy-to-understand yet academically sound answers to these questions while also dispelling commonly held misconceptions. Written from the point of view of an American Muslim, the book addresses what readers in the Western world are most curious about, beginning with the basics of Islam and how Muslims practice their religion before easing into more complicated issues like jihad, Islamic fundamentalism, and the status of women in Islam. Author Sumbul Ali-Karamali’s vivid anecdotes about growing up Muslim and female in the West, along with her sensitive, scholarly overview of Islam, combine for a uniquely insightful look at the world’s fastest growing religion.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Hope warms the coldest night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.</description>

  <description>Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin. But Winter isn't as weak as Levana believes her to be and she's been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters? Fans will not want to miss this thrilling conclusion to Marissa Meyer's national bestselling Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of &lt;i&gt;Persuasion&lt;/i&gt; will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl.&lt;br /&gt;There’s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin’s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone A wants to be with—day in, day out, day after day.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Dennard, &lt;i&gt;Sightwitch&lt;/i&gt; is an illustrated novella set in the Witchlands and told through Ryber’s journal entries and sketches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Safi and Iseult battled a Bloodwitch...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Merik returned from the dead…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryber Fortiza was a Sightwitch Sister at a secluded convent, waiting to be called by her goddess into the depths of the mountain. There she would receive the gift of foretelling. But when that call never comes, Ryber finds herself the only Sister without the Sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years pass and Ryber’s misfit pain becomes a dull ache, until one day, Sisters who already possess the Sight are summoned into the mountain, never to return. Soon enough, Ryber is the only Sister left. Now, it is up to her to save her Sisters, though she does not have the Sight—and though she does not know what might await her inside the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her journey underground, she encounters a young captain named Kullen Ikray, who has no memory of who he is or how he got there. Together, the two journey ever deeper in search of answers, their road filled with horrors, and what they find at the end of that road will alter the fate of the Witchlands forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set a year before &lt;i&gt;Truthwitch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sightwitch&lt;/i&gt; is a companion novella that also serves as a set up to &lt;i&gt;Bloodwitch&lt;/i&gt;, as well as an expansion of the Witchlands world.</description>

Scarred yet alive, Merik is determined to prove his sister’s treachery. Upon reaching the royal capital, crowded with refugees, he haunts the streets, fighting for the weak—which leads to whispers of a disfigured demigod, the Fury, who brings justice to the oppressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Bloodwitch Aeduan discovers a bounty on Iseult, he makes sure to be the first to find her—yet in a surprise twist, Iseult offers him a deal. She will return money stolen from him, if he locates Safi. Now they must work together to cross the Witchlands, while constantly wondering, who will betray whom first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a surprise attack and shipwreck, Safi and the Empress of Marstok barely escape with their lives. Alone in a land of pirates, every moment balances on a knife’s edge—especially when the pirates’ next move could unleash war upon the Witchlands.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a solid enough sequel, although I didn't like it as much as I did Truthwitch. This one just had some pacing issues for me. It feels a lot different from Truthwitch in how the story progresses and at what pace, so it took a bit to get in the groove. I also still wish there was a bit more...]]>

  <description>The thrilling conclusion to #1 bestselling Shiver trilogy from Maggie Stievater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sam met Grace, he was a wolf and she was a girl. Eventually he found a way to become a boy, and their love transformed from curious distance to the intense closeness of shared lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should have been the end of their story. But Grace was not meant to stay human. Now she is the wolf. And the wolves of Mercy Falls are about to be hunted in one final, spectacular kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam would do anything for Grace. But can one boy and one love really change a hostile, predatory world? The past, the present, and the future will all collide in one pure moment - a moment of death or life, farewell or forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;Praise for Maggie Stiefvater:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If Shiver left fans wanting more, Linger will have them begging." -Romantic Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* "Beautiful and moving...The mythology surrounding the wolf pack is clever and so well written that it seems perfectly normal for the creatures to exist in today's world. A must-have that will give Bella and Edward a run for their money." - SLJ, starred review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* "Stiefvater leaves the faeries of Lament and Ballad for a lyrical tale of alienated werewolves and first love....her take on werewolves is interesting and original while her characters are refreshingly willing to use their brains to deal with the challenges they face." - PW, starred review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All readers will be able to enjoy Stiefvater's fast-paced storytelling and dedication to the old-fashioned art of creating a believable and enduring romance. Shiver is beautifully written, even poetic at times, and a perfect indulgence for readers of all ages." - BookPage;Maggie Stiefvater is the #1 NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author of the novels SHIVER, LINGER, and FOREVER. Her novel THE SCORPIO RACES was named a Michael L. Printz Honor Book by the American Library Association, while PUBLISHERS WEEKLY selected Maggie's THE RAVEN BOYS as a Best Book of the Year. She is also the author of LAMENT and BALLAD. Maggie lives in Virginia with her husband and their two children.

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>For Penny Lee high school was a total nonevent. Her friends were okay, her grades were fine, and while she somehow managed to land a boyfriend, he doesn’t actually know anything about her. When Penny heads to college in Austin, Texas, to learn how to become a writer, it’s seventy-nine miles and a zillion light years away from everything she can’t wait to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam’s stuck. Literally, figuratively, emotionally, financially. He works at a café and sleeps there too, on a mattress on the floor of an empty storage room upstairs. He knows that this is the god-awful chapter of his life that will serve as inspiration for when he’s a famous movie director but right this second the seventeen bucks in his checking account and his dying laptop are really testing him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sam and Penny cross paths it’s less meet-cute and more a collision of unbearable awkwardness. Still, they swap numbers and stay in touch—via text—and soon become digitally inseparable, sharing their deepest anxieties and secret dreams without the humiliating weirdness of having to &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; each other.</description>

  <description>Spring break. Aruba. Swimming, sunshine, and drinks. Lots of drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s supposed to be the best time of Anna’s life. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Anna’s best friend is found brutally murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the local police begin to investigate the gruesome crime, suspicion and evidence unfathomably point to one person—Anna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now trapped in a country not her own, Anna must fight for her freedom and prove her innocence. But as she awaits the judge’s decision, it becomes clear to Anna that everyone around her thinks she is not only guilty, but dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the truth finally comes out, it’s more shocking than anyone could have ever imagined…</description>

  <description>From a dazzlingly talented young writer, a haunting and original supernatural romance in the vein of TWILIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house. One yellow-eyed wolf--her wolf--is a chilling presence she can't seem to live without. Meanwhile, Sam has lived two lives: In winter, the frozen woods, the protection of the pack, and the silent company of a fearless girl. In summer, a few precious months of being human . . . until the cold makes him shift back again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Grace meets a yellow-eyed boy whose familiarity takes her breath away. It's her wolf. It has to be. But as winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human--or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever.;Maggie Stiefvater is the #1 NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author of the novels SHIVER, LINGER, and FOREVER. Her novel THE SCORPIO RACES was named a Michael L. Printz Honor Book by the American Library Association, while PUBLISHERS WEEKLY selected Maggie's THE RAVEN BOYS as a Best Book of the Year. She is also the author of LAMENT and BALLAD. Maggie lives in Virginia with her husband and their two children.

  <description>Juliette Ferrars thought she'd won. She took over Sector 45, was named the new Supreme Commander, and now has Warner by her side. But she's still the girl with the ability to kill with a single touch—and now she's got the whole world in the palm of her hand. When tragedy hits, who will she become? Will she be able to control the power she wields and use it for good?</description>

  <description>The Circle is hers. But Avery West has lost everything else: her mother, the family she’d just found, and the one boy she trusted. In their place are unfathomable power, a staged relationship that makes her question every real feeling she’s ever had, and a mission to find the cure to the virus that’s made her own blood a weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then disaster strikes, turning Avery, Stellan, Jack, and Elodie into the most wanted people in the world. To clear their names and the growing rift between the families of the Circle before the world dissolves into World War Three, they’ll have to make a desperate, dangerous final race for Alexander the Great’s tomb. What they will find inside will mean the world’s salvation—or destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery will have to decide how much she’s willing to sacrifice—for the world, for family, and for love—in this conclusion to the Conspiracy of Us series.</description>

  <description>Two weeks.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how long it took for Avery West’s ordinary life to change forever: In two weeks, she discovered she was heiress to a powerful secret society known as the Circle, learned her mother was taken hostage by the Circle’s enemies, and fell for a boy she’s not allowed to love, just as she found out another was her unwelcome destiny.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Avery crosses oceans in private jets to hunt for clues that will uncover the truth about the Circle, setting her mom and herself free before it’s too late. By her side are both the boys: Jack—steady, loyal, and determined to help her even at the expense of his own duty—and Stellan, whose connection to Avery grows stronger by the day despite her best intentions, making her question what she believes at every turn.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But at the end of a desperate hunt from the islands of Greece to the red carpet at Cannes comes a discovery that not only changes everything, but could bring the whole world to its knees. And now Avery is forced to face the truth: in the world of the Circle, no one is what they seem.</description>

  <description>Haunted by the sacrifices he made in Constantinople, Radu is called back to the new capital. Mehmed is building an empire, becoming the sultan his people need. But Mehmed has a secret: as emperor, he is more powerful than ever . . . and desperately lonely. Does this mean Radu can finally have more with Mehmed . . . and would he even want it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lada's rule of absolute justice has created a Wallachia free of crime. But Lada won't rest until everyone knows that her country's borders are inviolable. Determined to send a message of defiance, she has the bodies of Mehmed's peace envoy delivered to him, leaving Radu and Mehmed with no choice. If Lada is allowed to continue, only death will prosper. They must go to war against the girl prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mehmed knows that he loves her. He understands her. She must lose to him so he can keep her safe. Radu alone fears that they are underestimating his sister's indomitable will. Only by destroying everything that came before--including her relationships--can Lada truly build the country she wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim the throne. Demand the crown. Rule the world.</description>

  <description>She has no allies. No throne. All she has is what she’s always had: herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After failing to secure the Wallachian throne, Lada Dracul is out to punish anyone who dares to cross her blood-strewn path. Filled with a white-hot rage, she storms the countryside with her men, accompanied by her childhood friend Bogdan, terrorizing the land. But brute force isn’t getting Lada what she wants. And thinking of Mehmed brings little comfort to her thorny heart. There’s no time to wonder whether he still thinks about her, even loves her. She left him before he could leave her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Lada needs is her younger brother Radu’s subtlety and skill. But Mehmed has sent him to Constantinople—and it’s no diplomatic mission. Mehmed wants control of the city, and Radu has earned an unwanted place as a double-crossing spy behind enemy lines. Radu longs for his sister’s fierce confidence—but for the first time in his life, he rejects her unexpected plea for help. Torn between loyalties to faith, to the Ottomans, and to Mehmed, he knows he owes Lada nothing. If she dies, he could never forgive himself—but if he fails in Constantinople, will Mehmed ever forgive him?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As nations fall around them, the Dracul siblings must decide: what will they sacrifice to fulfill their destinies? Empires will topple, thrones will be won…and souls will be lost.</description>

  <description>People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded town. And that rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior hockey team is about to compete in the national championships, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of the town now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys. &lt;br /&gt;A victory would send star player Kevin onto a brilliant professional future in the NHL. It would mean everything to Amat, a scrawny fifteen-year-old treated like an outcast everywhere but on the ice. And it would justify the choice that Peter, the team's general manager, and his wife, Kira, made to return to his hometown and raise their children in this beautiful but isolated place. &lt;br /&gt;Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semifinal match is the catalyst for a violent act that leaves a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Hers is a story no one wants to believe since the truth would mean the end of the dream. Accusations are made, and like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.</description>

  <description>The only thing 17-year-old Jane Sinner hates more than failure is pity. After a personal crisis and her subsequent expulsion from high school, she’s going nowhere fast. Jane’s well-meaning parents push her to attend a high school completion program at the nearby Elbow River Community College, and she agrees, on one condition: she gets to move out.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Jane tackles her housing problem by signing up for &lt;i&gt;House of Orange&lt;/i&gt;, a student-run reality show that is basically &lt;i&gt;Big Brother&lt;/i&gt;, but for Elbow River Students. Living away from home, the chance to win a car (used, but whatever), and a campus full of people who don't know what she did in high school… what more could she want? Okay, maybe a family that understands why she’d rather turn to Freud than Jesus to make sense of her life, but she'll settle for fifteen minutes in the proverbial spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As &lt;i&gt;House of Orange&lt;/i&gt; grows from a low-budget web series to a local TV show with fans and shoddy T-shirts, Jane finally has the chance to let her cynical, competitive nature thrive. She'll use her growing fan base, and whatever Intro to Psychology can teach her, to prove to the world—or at least viewers of substandard TV—that she has what it takes to win.</description>

  <description>No one expects a princess to be brutal. And Lada Dragwlya likes it that way. Ever since she and her gentle younger brother, Radu, were wrenched from their homeland of Wallachia and abandoned by their father to be raised in the Ottoman courts, Lada has known that being ruthless is the key to survival. She and Radu are doomed to act as pawns in a vicious game, an unseen sword hovering over their every move. For the lineage that makes them special also makes them targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lada despises the Ottomans and bides her time, planning her vengeance for the day when she can return to Wallachia and claim her birthright. Radu longs only for a place where he feels safe. And when they meet Mehmed, the defiant and lonely son of the sultan, Radu feels that he’s made a true friend—and Lada wonders if she’s finally found someone worthy of her passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mehmed is heir to the very empire that Lada has sworn to fight against—and that Radu now considers home. Together, Lada, Radu, and Mehmed form a toxic triangle that strains the bonds of love and loyalty to the breaking point.</description>

As the fight for Mytica rages on, he must decide just how much more he's willing to sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucia&lt;/b&gt; knows there's something special about her daughter and she'll do anything to protect her, even if that means facing Kyan alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amara&lt;/b&gt; is called back home to Kraeshia. Grandma Cortas has her own plans for Mytica's future. She promises Amara power, revenge, and dominance if she agrees to be part of her scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnus and Cleo&lt;/b&gt;'s love will be put to the ultimate test. Dark magic is causing widespread destruction throughout the kingdom. Enemies across the sea are advancing. And unrest is stirring throughout the land. Is their love strong enough to withstand the outside forces tearing them apart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The modern classic &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; is now a graphic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Speak up for yourself-we want to know what you have to say." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless--an outcast--because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. Through her work on an art project, she is finally able to face what really happened that night: She was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12475141-the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao" rel="nofollow"&gt;9781594483295&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar is a sweet but disastrously overweight ghetto nerd who—from the New Jersey home he shares with his old world mother and rebellious sister—dreams of becoming the Dominican J.R.R. Tolkien and, most of all, finding love. But Oscar may never get what he wants. Blame the fukú—a curse that has haunted Oscar’s family for generations, following them on their epic journey from Santo Domingo to the USA. Encapsulating Dominican-American history, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao opens our eyes to an astonishing vision of the contemporary American experience and explores the endless human capacity to persevere—and risk it all—in the name of love.</description>

  <description>New Year's Eve ended with a bang and Mary, Kat and Lillia may not be prepared for what is to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Rennie's death, Kat and Lillia try to put the pieces together of what happened to her. They both blame themselves. If Lillia hadn't left with Reeve... If Kat had only stayed with Rennie... Things could have been different. Now they will never be the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Mary knows the truth about that night. About what she is. She also knows the truth about Lillia and Reeve falling in love, about Reeve being happy when all he deserves is misery, just like the misery he caused her. Now their childish attempts at revenge are a thing of the past and Mary is out for blood. Will she leave anything in her wake or will all that remain be ashes?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When sweet revenge turns sour… Book two of a trilogy from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillia, Kat, and Mary had the perfect plan. Work together in secret to take down the people who wronged them. But things didn’t exactly go the way they’d hoped at the Homecoming Dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, it looks like they got away with it. All they have to do is move on and pick up the pieces, forget there ever was a pact. But it’s not easy, not when Reeve is still a total jerk and Rennie’s meaner than she ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s sweet little Mary…she knows there’s something seriously wrong with her. If she can’t control her anger, she’s sure that someone will get hurt even worse than Reeve was. Mary understands now that it’s not just that Reeve bullied her—it’s that he made her love him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, burn for a burn. A broken heart for a broken heart. The girls are up to the task. They’ll make Reeve fall in love with Lillia and then they will crush him. It’s the only way he’ll learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems once a fire is lit, the only thing you can do is let it burn...</description>

  <description>Postcard-perfect Jar Island is home to charming tourist shops, pristine beaches, amazing oceanfront homes—and three girls secretly plotting revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KAT is sick and tired of being bullied by her former best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LILLIA has always looked out for her little sister, so when she discovers that one of her guy friends has been secretly hooking up with her, she’s going to put a stop to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MARY is perpetually haunted by a traumatic event from years past, and the boy who’s responsible has yet to get what’s coming to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the girls can act on their revenge fantasies alone without being suspected. But together…anything is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an alliance in place, there will be no more “I wish I’d said…” or “If I could go back and do things differently...” These girls will show Jar Island that revenge is a dish best enjoyed together.</description>

  <description>Five years after the destruction of the so-called rehabilitation camps that imprisoned her and countless other Psi kids, seventeen-year-old Suzume "Zu" Kimura has assumed the role of spokesperson for the interim government, fighting for the rights of Psi kids against a growing tide of misinformation and prejudice. But when she is accused of committing a horrifying act, she is forced to go on the run once more in order to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to clear her name, Zu finds herself in an uncomfortable alliance with Roman and Priyanka, two mysterious Psi who could either help her prove her innocence or betray her before she gets the chance. But as they travel in search of safety and answers, and Zu grows closer to the people she knows she shouldn't trust, they uncover even darker things roiling beneath the veneer of the country's recovery. With her future-and the future of all Psi-on the line, Zu must use her powerful voice to fight back against forces that seek to drive the Psi into the shadows and save the friends who were once her protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 New York Times best-selling author Alexandra Bracken comes a harrowing story of resilience, resistance, and reckoning that will thrill loyal fans and new readers alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliffside mansion on the Italian Riviera. Each is unprepared for the consequences of their attraction when, during the restless summer weeks, unrelenting currents of obsession, fascination, and desire intensify their passion and test the charged ground between them. Recklessly, the two verge toward the one thing both fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Daughter of immortals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Princess Diana longs to prove herself to her legendary warrior sisters. But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law—risking exile—to save a mortal. Diana will soon learn that she has rescued no ordinary girl, and that with this single brave act, she may have doomed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daughter of death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alia Keralis just wanted to escape her overprotective brother with a semester at sea. She doesn’t know she is being hunted by people who think her very existence could spark a world war. When a bomb detonates aboard her ship, Alia is rescued by a mysterious girl of extraordinary strength and forced to confront a horrible truth: Alia is a Warbringer—a direct descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two girls will face an army of enemies—mortal and divine—determined to either destroy or possess the Warbringer. Tested beyond the bounds of their abilities, Diana and Alia must find a way to unleash hidden strengths and forge an unlikely alliance. Because if they have any hope of saving both their worlds, they will have to stand side by side against the tide of war.</description>

Nothing is straightforward: there's Rafe, who lied to her, but has sacrificed his freedom to protect her; Kaden, who meant to assassinate her but has now saved her life; and the Vendans, whom she always believed to be barbarians but whom she now realizes are people who have been terribly brutalized by the kingdoms of Dalbreck and Morrighan. Wrestling with her upbringing, her gift, and her very sense of self, Lia will have to make powerful choices that affect her country, her people . . . and her own destiny.</description>

Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The four Pevensies help Caspian battle Miraz and ascend his rightful throne.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narnia... the land between the lamp-post and the castle of Cair Paravel, where animals talk, where magical things happen... and where adventure begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are returning to boarding school when they are summoned from the dreary train station (by Susan's own magic horn) to return to the land of Narnia—the land where they had ruled as kings and queens and where their help is desperately needed.</description>

  <description>When Gia Montgomery's boyfriend, Bradley, dumps her in the parking lot of her high school prom, she has to think fast. After all, she'd been telling her friends about him for months now. This was supposed to be the night she proved he existed. So when she sees a cute guy waiting to pick up his sister, she enlists his help. The task is simple: be her fill-in boyfriend—two hours, zero commitment, a few white lies. After that, she can win back the real Bradley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that days after prom, it's not the real Bradley she's thinking about, but the stand-in. The one whose name she doesn't even know. But tracking him down doesn't mean they're done faking a relationship. Gia owes him a favor and his sister intends to see that he collects: his ex-girlfriend's graduation party—three hours, zero commitment, a few white lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Gia begins to wonder if she could turn her fake boyfriend into a real one, Bradley comes waltzing back into her life, exposing her lie, and threatening to destroy her friendships and her new-found relationship.</description>

  <description>A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>Amber Appleton lives in a bus. Ever since her mom's boyfriend kicked them out, Amber, her mom, and her totally loyal dog, Bobby Big Boy (aka Thrice B) have been camped out in the back of Hello Yellow (the school bus her mom drives). Still, Amber, the self-proclaimed princess of hope and girl of unyielding optimism, refuses to sweat the bad stuff. But when a fatal tragedy threatens Amber's optimism--and her way of life, can Amber continue to be the rock star of hope?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an oddball cast of characters, and a heartwarming, inspiring story, this novel unveils a beautifully beaten-up world of laughs, loyalty, and hard-earned hope. The world is Amber's stage, and Amber is, well...she's sorta like a rock star. True? True.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In addition to the P-38, there are four gifts, one for each of my friends. I want to say good-bye to them properly. I want to give them each something to remember me by. To let them know I really cared about them and I'm sorry I couldn't be more than I was--that I couldn't stick around--and that what's going to happen today isn't their fault.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is Leonard Peacock's birthday. It is also the day he will kill his former best friend, and then himself, with his grandfather's P-38 pistol. Maybe one day he'll believe that being different is okay, important even. But not today.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a pretty solid read. The character's voice was really well established. It was a little predictable at times, but that didn't stop my enjoyment of the story. Obviously, this is a pretty dark book, being about a boy who's planning to kill his ex-best friend and then himself. For that reas...]]>

Like having to marry someone she’s never met to secure a political alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up and ready for a new life, Lia escapes to a distant village on the morning of her wedding. She settles in among the common folk, intrigued when two mysterious and handsome strangers arrive—and unaware that one is the jilted prince and the other an assassin sent to kill her. Deceptions swirl and Lia finds herself on the brink of unlocking perilous secrets—secrets that may unravel her world—even as she feels herself falling in love.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;"We were all heading for each other on a collision course, no matter what. Maybe some people are just meant to be in the same story."&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Jude and her twin brother Noah, are inseparable. Noah draws constantly and is falling in love with the charismatic boy next door, while daredevil Jude wears red-red lipstick, cliff-dives, and does all the talking for both of them. Years later, they are barely speaking. Something has happened to change the twins in different yet equally devastating ways . . . but then Jude meets an intriguing, irresistible boy and a mysterious new mentor. The early years are Noah's to tell; the later years are Jude's. But they each have only half the story, and if they can only find their way back to one another, they'll have a chance to remake their world. This radiant, award-winning novel from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Sky Is Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; will leave you breathless and teary and laughing—often all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Printz Award Winner Stonewall Honor Book.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Adrift after her sister Bailey's sudden death, Lennie finds herself torn between quiet, seductive Toby—Bailey's boyfriend who shares her grief—and Joe, the new boy in town who bursts with life and musical genius. Each offers Lennie something she desperately needs... though she knows if the two of them collide her whole world will explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Join Lennie on this heartbreaking and hilarious journey of profound sorrow and mad love, as she makes colossal mistakes and colossal discoveries, as she traipses through band rooms and forest bedrooms and ultimately right into your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As much a celebration of love as a poignant portrait of loss, Lennie's struggle to sort her own melody out of the noise around her is always honest, often uproarious, and absolutely unforgettable.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A National Book Award Finalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A PEN/Faulkner Award Finalist &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt;. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.</description>

      <![CDATA[From what I heard about this book before reading, I was believing that it was a dystopian novel that follows a traveling theater troupe. Partially, that's true, but it's also so much more. It's one of those books that's hard to nail down a plot. But I think a better description for the book would...]]>

  <description>In the year 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. When Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

  <description>When a beautiful, aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City. She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.</description>

  <description>Avery West's newfound family can shut down Prada when they want to shop in peace, and can just as easily order a bombing when they want to start a war. Part of a powerful and dangerous secret society called the Circle, they believe Avery is the key to an ancient prophecy. Some want to use her as a pawn. Some want her dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To unravel the mystery putting her life in danger, Avery must follow a trail of clues from the monuments of Paris to the back alleys of Istanbul with two boys who work for the Circle — beautiful, volatile Stellan and mysterious, magnetic Jack. But as the clues expose a stunning conspiracy that might plunge the world into World War 3, she discovers that both boys are hiding secrets of their own. Now she will have to choose not only between freedom and family — but between the boy who might help her save the world, and the one she's falling in love with.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Lauren Graham, the beloved star of &lt;i&gt;Gilmore Girls &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Parenthood,&lt;/i&gt; comes a witty, charming, and hilariously relatable debut novel about a struggling young actress trying to get ahead―and keep it together―in New York City.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; It’s January 1995, and Franny Banks has just six months left of the three-year deadline she set for herself when she came to New York, dreaming of Broadway and doing “important” work. But all she has to show for her efforts so far is a part in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters, and a gig waiting tables at a comedy club. Her roommates―her best friend Jane, and Dan, an aspiring sci-fi writer―are supportive, yet Franny knows a two-person fan club doesn’t exactly count as success. Everyone tells her she needs a backup plan, and though she can almost picture moving back home and settling down with her perfectly nice ex-boyfriend, she’s not ready to give up on her goal of having a career like her idols Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Not just yet. But while she dreams of filling their shoes, in the meantime, she’d happily settle for a speaking part in almost anything—and finding a hair product combination that works.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Everything is riding on the upcoming showcase for her acting class, where she’ll finally have a chance to perform for people who could actually hire her. And she can’t let herself be distracted by James Franklin, a notorious flirt and the most successful actor in her class, even though he’s suddenly started paying attention. Meanwhile, her bank account is rapidly dwindling, her father wants her to come home, and her agent doesn’t return her calls. But for some reason, she keeps believing that she just might get what she came for.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Someday, Someday, Maybe&lt;/i&gt; is a story about hopes and dreams, being young in a city, and wanting something deeply, madly, desperately. It’s about finding love, finding yourself, and perhaps most difficult of all in New York City, finding an acting job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A winning, entertaining read . . . [Lauren Graham] has smartly mined just the right details from her own experience, infusing her work with crackling dialogue and observations about show business that ring funny and true.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “A charmer of a first novel . . . [Graham] has an easy, unforced style and, when the situation calls for it, a keen sense of the ridiculous.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “With insight, care, and an abundance of humor . . . Graham demonstrates that her acting chops are not her only talent.”&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;—Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Thoroughly charming.”&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;—Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Cuckoo's Calling&lt;/i&gt; is a 2013 crime fiction novel by J. K. Rowling, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant mystery in a classic vein: Detective Cormoran Strike investigates a supermodel's suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.</description>

Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer.</description>

It’s a powerful magic that many would kill to have on their side, especially amongst the nobility to which Safi was born. So Safi must keep her gift hidden, lest she be used as a pawn in the struggle between empires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iseult, a Threadwitch, can see the invisible ties that bind and entangle the lives around her—but she cannot see the bonds that touch her own heart. Her unlikely friendship with Safi has taken her from life as an outcast into one of reckless adventure, where she is a cool, wary balance to Safi’s hotheaded impulsiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safi and Iseult just want to be free to live their own lives, but war is coming to the Witchlands. With the help of the cunning Prince Merik (a Windwitch and ship’s captain) and the hindrance of a Bloodwitch bent on revenge, the friends must fight emperors, princes, and mercenaries alike, who will stop at nothing to get their hands on a Truthwitch.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

So when her mother goes missing, Aria knows her chances of surviving in the outer wasteland long enough to find her are slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Aria meets an outsider named Perry. He's searching for someone too.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to improve your idea's chances--essential reading in the "fake news" era.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Twain once observed, "A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on." His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them "stick."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/i&gt;, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous "kidney theft ring" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/i&gt; will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, &lt;i&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/i&gt; shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</description>

  <description>In this remarkable and elegant work, acclaimed Yale Law School professor Kenji Yoshino fuses legal manifesto and poetic memoir to call for a redefinition of civil rights in our law and culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone covers. To cover is to downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream. Because all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives. Given its pervasiveness, we may experience this pressure to be a simple fact of social life.&lt;br /&gt;Against conventional understanding, Kenji Yoshino argues that the demand to cover can pose a hidden threat to our civil rights. Though we have come to some consensus against penalizing people for differences based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and disability, we still routinely deny equal treatment to people who refuse to downplay differences along these lines. Racial minorities are pressed to “act white” by changing their names, languages, or cultural practices. Women are told to “play like men” at work. Gays are asked not to engage in public displays of same-sex affection. The devout are instructed to minimize expressions of faith, and individuals with disabilities are urged to conceal the paraphernalia that permit them to function. In a wide-ranging analysis, Yoshino demonstrates that American civil rights law has generally ignored the threat posed by these covering demands. With passion and rigor, he shows that the work of civil rights will not be complete until it attends to the harms of coerced conformity. &lt;br /&gt;At the same time, Yoshino is responsive to the American exasperation with identity politics, which often seems like an endless parade of groups asking for state and social solicitude. He observes that the ubiquity of the covering demand provides an opportunity to lift civil rights into a higher, more universal register. Since we all experience the covering demand, we can all make common cause around a new civil rights paradigm based on our desire for authenticity–a desire that brings us together rather than driving us apart. &lt;br /&gt;Yoshino’s argument draws deeply on his personal experiences as a gay Asian American. He follows the Romantics in his belief that if a human life is described with enough particularity, the universal will speak through it. The result is a work that combines one of the most moving memoirs written in years with a landmark manifesto on the civil rights of the future.&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;“This brilliantly argued and engaging book does two things at once, and it does them both astonishingly well. First, it's a finely grained memoir of young man’s struggles to come to terms with his sexuality, and second, it's a powerful argument for a whole new way of thinking about civil rights and how our society deals with difference. This book challenges us all to confront our own unacknowledged biases, and it demands that we take seriously the idea that there are many different ways to be human. Kenji Yoshino is the face and the voice of the new civil rights.” -Barbara Ehrenreich, author of &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Kenji Yoshino has not only given us an important, compelling new way to understand civil rights law, a major accomplishment in itself, but with great bravery and honesty, he has forged his argument from the cauldron of his own experience. In clear, lyrical prose, &lt;i&gt;Covering &lt;/i&gt;quite literally brings the law to life. The result is a book about our &lt;br /&gt;public and private selves as convincing to the spirit as it is to the &lt;br /&gt;mind.” -Adam Haslett, author of &lt;i&gt;You Are Not A Stranger Here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Kenji Yoshino's work is often moving and always clarifying. &lt;i&gt;Covering&lt;/i&gt; elaborates an original, arresting account of identity and authenticity in American culture.”&lt;br /&gt;-Anthony Appiah, author of &lt;i&gt;The Ethics of Identity&lt;/i&gt; and Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor Of Philosophy at Princeton University&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This stunning book introduces three faces of the remarkable Kenji Yoshino: a writer of poetic beauty; a soul of rare reflectivity and decency; and a brilliant lawyer and scholar, passionately committed to uncovering human rights. Like W.E.B. DuBois's &lt;i&gt;The Souls of Black Folk&lt;/i&gt; and Betty Friedan's &lt;i&gt;The Feminine Mystique&lt;/i&gt;, this book fearlessly blends gripping narrative with insightful analysis to further the cause of human emancipation. And like those classics, it should explode into America's consciousness.”&lt;br /&gt;-Harold Hongju Koh Dean, Yale Law School and former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Covering&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent work - so eloquently and powerfully written I literally could not put it down. Sweeping in breadth, brilliantly argued, and filled with insight, humor, and erudition, it offers a fundamentally new perspective on civil rights and discrimination law. This extraordinary book is many things at once: an intensely moving personal memoir; a breathtaking historical and cultural synthesis of assimilation and American equality law; an explosive new paradigm for transcending the morass of identity politics; and in parts, pure poetry. No one interested in civil rights, sexuality, discrimination - or simply human flourishing - can afford to miss it.” &lt;br /&gt;-Amy Chua, author of &lt;i&gt;World on Fire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In this stunning, original book, Kenji Yoshino demonstrates that the struggle for gay rights is not only a struggle to liberate gays---it is a struggle to free all of us, straight and gay, male and female, white and black, from the pressures and temptations to cover vital aspects of ourselves and deprive ourselves and others of our full humanity. Yoshino is both poet and lawyer, and by joining an exquisitely observed personal memoir with a historical analysis of civil rights, he shows why gay rights is so controversial at present, &lt;br /&gt;why “covering” is the issue of contention, and why the “covering demand,” universal in application, is the civil rights issue of our time. This is a beautifully written, brilliant and hopeful book, offering a new understanding of what is at stake in our fight for &lt;br /&gt;human rights.” &lt;br /&gt;-Carol Gilligan, author of &lt;i&gt;In a Different Voice&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Why does talk in families so often go in circles, leaving us tied up in knots? In this illuminating book, Deborah Tannen, the linguist and and bestselling author of &lt;b&gt;You Just Don't Understand&lt;/b&gt; and many other books, reveals why talking to family members is so often painful and problematic even when we're all adults. Searching for signs of acceptance and belonging, we find signs of disapproval and rejection. Why do the seeds of family love so often yield a harvest of criticism and judgment? In &lt;b&gt;I Only Say This Because I Love You&lt;/b&gt;, Tannen shows how important it is, in family talk, to learn to separate word meanings, or messages, from heart meanings, or metamessages — unstated but powerful meanings that come from the history of our relationships and the way things are said. Presenting real conversations from people's lives, Tannen reveals what is actually going on in family talk, including how family conversations must balance the longing for connection with the desire for control, as we struggle to be close without giving up our freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye-opening book explains why grown women so often feel criticized by their mothers; and why mothers feel they can't open their mouths around their grown daughters; why growing up male or female, or as an older or younger sibling, results in different experiences of family that persist throughout our lives; and much, much more. By helping us to understand and redefine family talk, Tannen provides the tools to improve relationships with family members of every age.</description>

There were some interesting concepts discussed, but those are discussed early and then the rest of the book just becomes kind of repetitive.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I would say it's a pleasure to meet thee, Prosperity Oceanus Redding, but truly, I only anticipate the delights of destroying thy happiness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prosper is the only unexceptional Redding in his old and storied family history — that is, until he discovers the demon living inside him. Turns out Prosper's great-great-great-great-great-something grandfather made — and then broke — a contract with a malefactor, a demon who exchanges fortune for eternal servitude. And, weirdly enough, four-thousand-year-old Alastor isn't exactly the forgiving type. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fiend has reawakened with one purpose — to destroy the family whose success he ensured and who then betrayed him. With only days to break the curse and banish Alastor back to the demon realm, Prosper is playing unwilling host to the fiend, who delights in tormenting him with nasty insults and constant attempts trick him into a contract. Yeah, Prosper will take his future without a side of eternal servitude, thanks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little does Prosper know, the malefactor's control over his body grows stronger with each passing night, and there's a lot Alastor isn't telling his dim-witted (but admittedly strong-willed) human host.</description>

  <description>The epic conclusion to the internationally acclaimed Captive Prince trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damianos of Akielos has returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His identity now revealed, Damen must face his master Prince Laurent as Damianos of Akielos, the man Laurent has sworn to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the brink of a momentous battle, the future of both their countries hangs in the balance. In the south, Kastor’s forces are massing. In the north, the Regent’s armies are mobilising for war. Damen’s only hope of reclaiming his throne is to fight together with Laurent against their usurpers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced into an uneasy alliance the two princes journey deep into Akielos, where they face their most dangerous opposition yet. But even if the fragile trust they have built survives the revelation of Damen’s identity – can it stand against the Regent’s final, deadly play for the throne?</description>

  <description>Nikolai Lantsov has always had a gift for the impossible. No one knows what he endured in his country’s bloody civil war—and he intends to keep it that way. Now, as enemies gather at his weakened borders, the young king must find a way to refill Ravka’s coffers, forge new alliances, and stop a rising threat to the once-great Grisha Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet with every day a dark magic within him grows stronger, threatening to destroy all he has built. With the help of a young monk and a legendary Grisha Squaller, Nikolai will journey to the places in Ravka where the deepest magic survives to vanquish the terrible legacy inside him. He will risk everything to save his country and himself. But some secrets aren’t meant to stay buried—and some wounds aren’t meant to heal.</description>

It felt like reading a new series in a way. Of course, you have to move past a lot of things that happened in that b...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Moxie girls fight back!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Carter is fed up. Fed up with her small-town Texas high school that thinks the football team can do no wrong. Fed up with sexist dress codes and hallway harassment. But most of all, Viv Carter is fed up with always following the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viv’s mom was a punk rock Riot Grrrl in the ’90s, so now Viv takes a page from her mother’s past and creates a feminist zine that she distributes anonymously to her classmates. She’s just blowing off steam, but other girls respond. Pretty soon Viv is forging friendships with other young women across the divides of cliques and popularity rankings, and she realizes that what she has started is nothing short of a girl revolution.</description>

  <description>In the first book of the Shaw Confessions, the companion series to the New York Times bestselling Mara Dyer novels, old skeletons are laid bare and new promises prove deadly. This is what happens after happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks seventeen-year-old Noah Shaw has the world on a string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara Dyer is the only one he trusts with his secrets and his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He shouldn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And both are scared that uncovering the truth about themselves will force them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re right.</description>
