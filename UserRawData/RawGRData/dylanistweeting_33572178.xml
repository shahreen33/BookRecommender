  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The deeply affecting next book from acclaimed author Amy Sarig King.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liberty Johansen is going to change the way we look at the night sky. Most people see the old constellations, the things they've been told to see. But Liberty sees new patterns, pictures, and possibilities. She's an exception. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other exceptions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her dad, who gave her the stars. Who moved out months ago and hasn't talked to her since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mom, who's happier since he left, even though everyone thinks she should be sad and lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And her sister, who won't go outside their house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liberty feels like her whole world is falling from space. Can she map a new life for herself and her family before they spin too far out of reach?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Hey, Kiddo&lt;/i&gt; is the graphic memoir of author-illustrator Jarrett J. Krosoczka. Raised by his colorful grandparents, who adopted him because his mother was an incarcerated heroin addict, Krosoczka didn't know his father's name until he saw his birth certificate when registering for a school ski trip. &lt;i&gt;Hey, Kiddo&lt;/i&gt; traces Krosoczka's search for his father, his difficult interactions with his mother, his day-to-day life with his grandparents, and his path to becoming an artist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, nearly one million people have viewed Krosoczka's TED Talk about his experience. Artwork from his childhood and teen years will be incorporated into the original illustrations for the book.</description>

  <description>When a determined girl is confronted with the culture of toxic masculinity, it's time to even the score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Michigan Manning lives for hockey, and this is her year to shine. That is, until she gets some crushing news: budget cuts will keep the girls' hockey team off the ice this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If she wants colleges to notice her, Michigan has to find a way to play. Luckily, there's still one team left in town ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The boys' team isn't exactly welcoming, but Michigan's prepared to prove herself. She plays some of the best hockey of her life, in fact, all while putting up with changing in the broom closet, constant trash talk and "harmless" pranks that always seem to target her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But once hazing crosses the line into assault, Michigan must weigh the consequences of speaking up - even if it means putting her future on the line.</description>

  <description>Savannah is dreading being home alone with her overbearing mother after her sister goes off to college. But if she can just get through senior year, she'll be able to escape to college, too. What she doesn't count on is that her mother's obsession with weight has only grown deeper since her appearance on an extreme weight-loss show, and now Savvy's mom is pressuring her even harder to be constantly mindful of what she eats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between her mom's diet-helicoptering, missing her sister, and worrying about her collegiate future, Savvy has enough to worry about. And then she meets George, the cute new kid at school who has insecurities of his own. As Savvy and George grow closer, they help each other discover how to live in the moment and enjoy the here and now before it disappears.</description>

  <description>Who gave Jonathan Van Ness permission to be the radiant human he is today? No one, honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, it hasn't always been gorgeous for this beacon of positivity and joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he stole our hearts as the grooming and self-care expert on Netflix's hit show Queer Eye, Jonathan was growing up in a small Midwestern town that didn't understand why he was so…over the top. From choreographed carpet figure skating routines to the unavoidable fact that he was Just. So. Gay., Jonathan was an easy target and endured years of judgement, ridicule and trauma—yet none of it crushed his uniquely effervescent spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the Top uncovers the pain and passion it took to end up becoming the model of self-love and acceptance that Jonathan is today. In this revelatory, raw, and rambunctious memoir, Jonathan shares never-before-told secrets and reveals sides of himself that the public has never seen. JVN fans may think they know the man behind the stiletto heels, the crop tops, and the iconic sayings, but there's much more to him than meets the Queer Eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll come away knowing that no matter how broken or lost you may be, you're a Kelly Clarkson song, you're strong, and you've got this.</description>

  <description>Danielle Cain is a queer punk rock traveller, jaded from a decade on the road. Searching for clues about her best friend’s mysterious and sudden suicide, she ventures to the squatter, utopian town of Freedom, Iowa. All is not well in Freedom, however: things went awry after the town’s residents summoned a protector spirit to serve as their judge and executioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danielle shows up in time to witness the spirit—a blood-red, three-antlered deer—begin to turn on its summoners. Danielle and her new friends have to act fast if they’re going to save the town—or get out alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a postapocalyptic take on the perennial classic "Little Red Riding Hood"...about a woman who isn't as defenseless as she seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not safe for anyone alone in the woods. There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse threats in the woods than the things that stalk their prey at night. Sometimes, there are men. Men with dark desires, weak wills, and evil intents. Men in uniform with classified information, deadly secrets, and unforgiving orders. And sometimes, just sometimes, there's something worse than all of the horrible people and vicious beasts combined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red doesn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she isn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she is a woman alone in the woods....</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>After four months of unemployment, former book editor Clara Montgomery is still stuck sleeping on her little brother’s ugly couch in Queens. Determined to keep her minuscule savings account intact, she takes a job clearing out abandoned storage units, but is in no way prepared for stumbling upon dead snakes or trying to identify exactly where the perpetual stench of beets is emanating from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clara comes across a unit that was once owned by an escort service, she finds the brothel “résumé” of a younger Caspian Tiddleswich… an astonishingly famous British actor. Her best friend thinks she should sell the gossip to a tabloid to fund her way off the couch from hell, but Clara instead manages to track down Caspian’s contact info, intending to reassure him that her lips are sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Caspian misinterprets Clara’s attempt at altruism and shows up on her doorstep, accusing her of blackmail. When the paparazzi capture a photo of them together, Caspian’s PR team sees an opportunity to promote his latest film—and if Clara wants to atone for her “crimes,” she’ll have to play along. Pretending to be Caspian’s girlfriend seems like it will be a tolerable, if somewhat daunting, penance… until their fake romance becomes something more than either of them expected.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of Laurie Halse Anderson and Sara Zarr, one girl embraces the power of her voice: rules are meant to be broken and she won’t stay silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Skye has her sights set on one thing: getting the heck out of Dodge. Art school is her ticket out and she’s already been accepted to her first choice, MICA. All she has to do is survive her senior year, not get too drunk at parties, and be there for her little sister, Emma. Sure, she’s usually battling a hangover when she drives to pick Emma up, but she has everything under control. Until he returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her mom’s ex-boyfriend slithers his way back into her family, it’s all Skye can do to keep the walls of her world from crumbling. Her family has no idea Skye has been guarding a dark secret about her past–about him–and she never thought she would have to face him again. She knows she has to get away from him at all costs. But how can she abandon Emma? Skye’s heart is torn between escaping the man who hurt her years ago and protecting her loved ones from the monster in their midst. Running away from her fears isn’t an option. To save her sister–and herself–she’ll have to break all the rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling authors Sarina Bowen &amp;amp; Elle Kennedy return with their first Male / Male romance in 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts, 21&lt;br /&gt;Jock. Secretly a science geek. Hot AF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: So. Here goes. For her birthday, my girlfriend wants…a threesome.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Then you’ve come to the right hookup app.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Have you done this sort of thing before? With another guy?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: All the time. I'm an equal opportunity player. You?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: [crickets!]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SinnerThree, 21&lt;br /&gt;Finance major. Secretly a male dancer. Hot AF. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Well, I’m down if you are. My life is kind of a mess right now. School, work, family stress. Oh, and I live next door to the most annoying dude in the world. I need the distraction. Are you sure you want this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: I might want it a little more than I’m willing to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Hey, nothing wrong with pushing your boundaries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Tell that to my control-freak father. Anyway. What if this threesome is awkward?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SinnerThree: Then it’s awkward. It’s not like we’ll ever have to see each other again. Right? Just promise you won’t fall in love with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LobsterShorts: Now wouldn’t that be life-changing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q&amp;amp;A about Top Secret:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Have we met these characters before in another book?&lt;br /&gt;A: No! These guys are brand new, and we can’t wait for you to meet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Is this story MM? Or is it a MMF / MFM / menage?&lt;br /&gt;A: This book is MM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Is this a love triangle story?&lt;br /&gt;A: Not really. You’ll see.</description>

  <description>Life was better in the old days. Or was it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That’s the question Greg Heffley is asking as his town voluntarily unplugs and goes electronics-free. But modern life has its conveniences, and Greg isn’t cut out for an old-fashioned world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With tension building inside and outside the Heffley home, will Greg find a way to survive? Or is going “old school” just too hard for a kid like Greg?</description>

  <description>For the last six months, shy, nerdy, English teacher Carter Bennett has been crushing on the brand new PE teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t matter how many months in the school year there are, Carter knows that cool, laid-back, college baseball star Nolan returning his feelings is hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until they’re both called in front of the Principal and given an impossible task: take over the spring musical from the MIA choir director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carter knows all about literature and plays, but had to give up his college theater major because his shyness was too crippling. Nolan knows even less. But despite lapses in choreography, terrible acting, a complete lack of sets, and costumes from the eighteenth century, they’re going to have to hit all the right notes, together.</description>

  <description>With a touch, Lexi can sense how and when someone will die. Some say it’s a gift. But to Lexi it’s a curse—one that keeps her friendless and alone. All that changes when Lexi foresees the violent death of a young woman, Jane, outside a club. But Jane doesn’t go to the afterlife quietly. Her ghost remains behind, determined to hunt down her murderer, and she needs Lexi’s help. In life, Jane was everything Lexi is not—outgoing, happy, popular. But in death, all Jane wants is revenge. Lexi will do anything to help Jane, to make up for the fact that she didn’t—couldn’t—save Jane’s life, and to keep this beautiful ghost of a girl by her side for as long as possible.</description>

  <description>The only sort of risk 18-year-old Laila Piedra enjoys is the peril she writes for the characters in her stories: epic sci-fi worlds full of quests, forbidden love, and robots. Her creative writing teacher has always told her she has a special talent. But three months before her graduation, he's suddenly replaced—by Nadiya Nazarenko, a Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist who is sadistically critical and perpetually unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; At first, Nazarenko’s eccentric assignments seem absurd. But before long, Laila grows obsessed with gaining the woman’s approval. Soon Laila is pushing herself far from her comfort zone, discovering the psychedelic highs and perilous lows of nightlife, temporary flings, and instability. Dr. Nazarenko has led Laila to believe that she must choose between perfection and sanity—but rejecting her all-powerful mentor may be the only way for Laila to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Millie Quint is devastated when she discovers that her sort-of-best friend/sort-of-girlfriend has been kissing someone else. And because Millie cannot stand the thought of confronting her ex every day, she decides to apply for scholarships to boarding schools . . . the farther from Houston the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millie can't believe her luck when she's accepted into one of the world's most exclusive schools, located in the rolling highlands of Scotland. Everything about Scotland is different: the country is misty and green; the school is gorgeous, and the students think Americans are cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem: Mille's roommate Flora is a total princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's also an &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; princess. Of Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the girls can barely stand each other--Flora is both high-class &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; high-key--but before Millie knows it, she has another sort-of-best-friend/sort-of-girlfriend. Even though Princess Flora could be a new chapter in her love life, Millie knows the chances of happily ever afters are slim . . . after all, real life isn't a fairy tale . . . or is it?</description>

  <description>A family road trip is supposed to be a lot of fun . . . unless, of course, you’re the Heffleys. The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig—not exactly Greg Heffley’s idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure—and this is one the Heffleys won’t soon forget.</description>

  <description>Award-winning Mexican author Juan Pablo Villalobos explores illegal immigration with this emotionally raw and timely nonfiction book about ten Central American teens and their journeys to the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't really tell what time it is when you're in the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, thousands of migrant children and teens cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The journey is treacherous and sometimes deadly, but worth the risk for migrants who are escaping gang violence and poverty in their home countries. And for those refugees who do succeed? They face an immigration process that is as winding and multi-tiered as the journey that brought them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, award-winning Mexican author Juan Pablo Villalobos strings together the diverse experiences of eleven real migrant teenagers, offering readers a beginning road map to issues facing the region. These timely accounts of courage, sacrifice, and survival—including two fourteen-year-old girls forming a tenuous friendship as they wait in a frigid holding cell, a boy in Chicago beginning to craft his future while piecing together his past in El Salvador, and cousins learning to lift each other up through angry waters—offer a rare and invaluable window into the U.S.–Central American refugee crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In turns optimistic and heartbreaking, The Other Side balances the boundless hope at the center of immigration with the weight of its risks and repercussions. Here is a necessary read for young people on both sides of the issue.</description>

  <description>Set in the summer of 1972, this moving YA historical novel is narrated by teen girls from different backgrounds with one thing in common: Each girl is dealing with pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;Four teenage girls. Four different stories. What they all have in common is that they’re dealing with unplanned pregnancies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In rural Georgia, Izella is wise beyond her years, but burdened with the responsibility of her older sister, Ola, who has found out she’s pregnant. Their young neighbor, Missippi, is also pregnant, but doesn’t fully understand the extent of her predicament. When her father sends her to Chicago to give birth, she meets the final narrator, Susan, who is white and the daughter of an anti-choice senator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randi Pink masterfully weaves four lives into a larger story – as timely as ever – about a woman’s right to choose her future.</description>

  <description>Warning: &lt;br /&gt; The novel that you are about to read contains various depictions of graphic violence and disturbed, unsettling situations that some may find offensive and disgusting. If I am to be completely honest, this book should not be read by everyone. Every character in this book is exactly that, a character. No one portrayed in this novel is based on any living person. It is simply fictional. That being said, nothing in this book is supposed to make sense. It is purposely surreal, which, in other words, means unrealistic. The majority of these accounts could obviously not happen in real life. That is the point of a book. To be over exaggerated, and you know, improbable. I did my part, and I warned you. To say the least, I am sorry for your nightmares. - Skylerr Darren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone, no matter who they are, has experienced a gloomy nightmare at least one point in their life. A dream so lucid and vivid that you aren't sure if the frightening tribulation truly happened or not. Victor Florence has been the victim of these startling, unearthly afflictions since his early adolescence, and it has molded him into the spineless introvert that he is today; a panic-stricken schizophrenic. Longing to desert his shattered past with little to no hope at all, Victor attempts a career at psychology to understand himself and the world around him, but that proves to be anything but simple. Before you can truly comprehend Victor, you first have to read his account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There sat a frail, abnormally-pallid African-American man. His weight looked rather questionable. He looked as if he hadn't eaten in months, judging by the fact that his integral skeleton had been visible through his diminished skin. He stared at me with no facial expression. He just sat there, staring."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satan, the brooding, scriptural ghoul that takes on the responsibility for murder, perversion, and the gruesome deaths of children. Society views these horrors as a grim nightmare-a nightmare in which one would desperately attempt to wake up from. But in reality, you simply just can't wake up from a nightmare, for both reality and fiction have become one. Victor, a timid young college student dreadfully awakens into such a demonic ordeal from the repulsive dismiss of his relatives, to macabre dreams and morbid occurrences. Do not look at Interview with The Devil: Part 1 as a mere book but instead the detour into your own self-morality.</description>

  <description>Remy Tsai used to know how her story would turn out. But now, she doesn’t even know what tomorrow will look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was happy once. Remy had her boyfriend Jack, and Elise, her best friend—her soulmate—who understood her better than anyone else in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now Jack is dead, shot through the chest—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was Elise who pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it self-defense? Or something deeper, darker than anything Remy could have imagined? As the police investigate, Remy does the same, sifting through her own memories, looking for a scrap of truth that could save the friendship that means everything to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating timelines, Thelma and Louise meets Gone Girl in this twisted psychological thriller about the dark side of obsessive friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A TV writer's room intern must join forces with her crush to keep her boss from ruining a lesbian character in this diverse contemporary YA romance from the author of &lt;i&gt;Queens of Geek&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Bex is thrilled when she gets an internship on her favorite tv show, Silver Falls. Unfortunately, the internship isn't quite what she expected... instead of sitting in a crowded writer's room volleying ideas back and forth, Production Interns are stuck picking up the coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to prove her worth as a writer, Bex drafts her own script and shares it with the head writer―who promptly reworks it and passes it off as his own! Bex is understandably furious, yet...maybe this is just how the industry works? But when they rewrite her proudly lesbian character as straight, that's the last straw! It's time for Bex and her crush to fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen Wilde's newest novel is both a fun, diverse love story and a very relevant, modern take on the portrayal of LGBT characters in media.</description>

  <description>David Linker at HarperCollins has bought &lt;i&gt;We Are the Ants&lt;/i&gt; author &lt;b&gt;Shaun David Hutchinson&lt;/b&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;The State of Us&lt;/i&gt;, the story of Dean and Dre—the 16-year-old sons of the Republican and Democratic candidates for President of the United States—who fall in love on the sidelines of their parents' presidential campaigns. The book is planned for summer 2020; Katie Shea Boutillier at Donald Maass Literary Agency brokered the deal for world rights.</description>

  <description>After escaping her kidnappers and destroying the black market where she was held captive, all Nita wants is to find a way to live her life without looking over her shoulder. But with a video of her ability to self-heal all over the dark web, Nita knows she’s still a prime target on the black market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one way to keep herself safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita must make herself so feared that no one would ever dare come after her again. And the best way to start building her reputation? Take her revenge on Fabricio, the boy who sold Nita to her kidnappers. But killing Fabricio is harder than Nita thought it would be, even with Kovit by her side. Now caught in a game of kill or be killed, Nita will do whatever it takes to win.</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.</description>

  <description>In this modern fairy tale, a noble prince and a brave knight come together to defeat a terrible monster and in the process find true love in a most unexpected place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Thank you,” he told his parents.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I appreciate that you tried,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;but I’m looking for something special&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;in a partner by my side.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once upon a time, in a kingdom far from here, there was a prince in line to take the throne, so his parents set out to find him a kind and worthy bride. The three of them traveled the land far and wide, but the prince didn't quite find what he was looking for in the princesses they met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While they were away, a terrible dragon threatened their land, and all the soldiers fled. The prince rushed back to save his kingdom from the perilous beast and was met by a brave knight in a suit of brightly shining armor. Together they fought the dragon and discovered that special something the prince was looking for all along.</description>

  <description>By day, seventeen-year-old Kiera Johnson is an honors student, a math tutor, and one of the only Black kids at Jefferson Academy. But at home, she joins hundreds of thousands of Black gamers who duel worldwide as Nubian personas in the secret multiplayer online role-playing card game, SLAY. No one knows Kiera is the game developer, not her friends, her family, not even her boyfriend, Malcolm, who believes video games are partially responsible for the "downfall of the Black man."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a teen in Kansas City is murdered over a dispute in the SLAY world, news of the game reaches mainstream media, and SLAY is labeled a racist, exclusionist, violent hub for thugs and criminals. Even worse, an anonymous troll infiltrates the game, threatening to sue Kiera for "anti-white discrimination."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven to save the only world in which she can be herself, Kiera must preserve her secret identity and harness what it means to be unapologetically Black in a world intimidated by Blackness. But can she protect her game without losing herself in the process?</description>

  <description>Ashton Hamid knows everything about gaming. His D&amp;amp;D battles are epic; the video game tournaments he organizes, multi-day tests of endurance with players around the world. Real life, however, is a different matter. So when he and his best friend—outspoken "A" student (and social outcast) Vale Shumway—head out on a camping trip to Waterton Lakes National Park with their Phys. Ed. class, Ash figures it’ll be two days of bug bites, bad food, and inside jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the two friends find themselves in a fight for survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected October snowstorm separates Ash and Vale from the rest of their class. By the time the teens realize they’ve missed the trail, they have wandered deep into the Canadian Rockies. Lost in the wilderness and hunted by deadly predators, their only hope is to work together. But with Vale’s limited supplies and Ash’s inexperience, can the best friends stay alive long enough to find their way back to civilization?</description>

  <description>Narwhal is a happy-go-lucky narwhal. Jelly is a no-nonsense jellyfish. The two might not have a lot in common, but they do they love waffles, parties and adventures. Join Narwhal and Jelly as they discover the whole wide ocean together.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderfully silly early graphic novel series featuring three stories. In the first, Jelly learns that Narwhal is a really good friend. Then Narwhal and Jelly form their own pod of awesomeness with their ocean friends. And finally, Narwhal and Jelly read the best book ever -- even though it doesn't have any words...or pictures!&lt;br /&gt;Ben Clanton showcases the joys of friendship, the benefits of working together and the power of imagination in the delightful Narwhal: Unicorn of the Sea.</description>

  <description>Clover — the “pretty” vampire of the title — is a Bardot-esque blonde who dreams of the (now-dead) girl she once was four years ago before becoming a fanged bloodsucker. She is being kept prisoner by her brother, Marcel, who fears Clover will be hunted by the outside world (and who may have other, more selfish motivations as well). Clover’s curiosity, however, will not be suppressed: impetuous, sensual, strong-willed, and fearless, she plans her escape. The resultant havoc would make Dario Argento proud.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Black Girl, they say you ain't 'posed to be here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of what twenty-first century culture tells black girls is not pretty: Don't wear this; don't smile at that. Don't have an opinion; don't dream big. And most of all, don't love yourself. In response to such destructive ideas, internationally recognized poet Mahogany Browne challenges the conditioning of society by crafting an anthem of strength and magic undeniable in its bloom for all beautiful Black girls. She has travelled the world sharing her vision of &lt;i&gt;Black Girl Magic&lt;/i&gt;, and now in collaboration with artist Jess X. Snow, presents her acclaimed tribute in a visual form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Girl Magic&lt;/i&gt; is a journey from girlhood to womanhood and an invitation to readers to find magic in themselves.</description>

  <description>A powerful, timely coming-of-age story about a young woman from Texas who goes on a road trip with two friends to get an abortion, from award-winning author Sharon Biggs Waller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camille couldn't be having a better summer. But on the very night she learns she got into a prestigious theater program, she also finds out she’s pregnant. She definitely can’t tell her parents. And her best friend, Bea, doesn’t agree with the decision Camille has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camille is forced to try to solve her problem alone . . . and the system is very much working against her. At her most vulnerable, Camille reaches out to Annabelle Ponsonby, a girl she only barely knows from the theater. Happily, Annabelle agrees to drive her wherever she needs to go. And in a last-minute change of heart, Bea decides to come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls on the Verge is an incredibly timely novel about a woman’s right to choose. Sharon Biggs Waller brings to life a narrative that has to continue to fight for its right to be told, and honored.</description>

  <description>Marjorie Glatt feels like a ghost. A practical thirteen year old in charge of the family laundry business, her daily routine features unforgiving customers, unbearable P.E. classes, and the fastidious Mr. Saubertuck who is committed to destroying everything she’s worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendell is a ghost. A boy who lost his life much too young, his daily routine features ineffective death therapy, a sheet-dependent identity, and a dangerous need to seek purpose in the forbidden human world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their worlds collide, Marjorie is confronted by unexplainable disasters as Wendell transforms Glatt’s Laundry into his midnight playground, appearing as a mere sheet during the day. While Wendell attempts to create a new afterlife for himself, he unknowingly sabotages the life that Marjorie is struggling to maintain.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From former Buzzfeed illustrator Adam Ellis comes a collection of autobiographical comics that follows a year in the artist’s life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam’s comics deal with weightier topics like seasonal affective disorder and struggles with self-esteem, while also touching on the silly and absurd—like his brief, but intense obsession with crystals. With a bright, positive outlook and a sense of humor, &lt;i&gt;Super Chill&lt;/i&gt; tells a story that is both highly relatable and intensely personal.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars.<br /><br />I had no idea who Adam was before reading this since I'm not a fan of Buzzfeed, but I still really enjoyed this! Some parts were relatable, and some seemed...kinda pointless, but I'd still recommend since I think it took me maybe 20 minutes to get through.]]>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Adventures in Babysitting&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; meets &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; in this funny, action-packed novel about a coven of witchy babysitters who realize their calling to protect the innocent and save the world from an onslaught of evil. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Esme Pearl has a babysitters club. She knows it's kinda lame, but what else is she supposed to do? Get a job? Gross. Besides, Esme likes babysitting, and she's good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lately Esme needs all the cash she can get, because it seems like destruction follows her wherever she goes. Let's just say she owes some people a new tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cassandra Heaven. She's Instagram-model hot, dresses like she found her clothes in a dumpster, and has a rebellious streak as gnarly as the cafeteria food. So why is Cassandra willing to do anything, even take on a potty-training two-year-old, to join Esme's babysitters club?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in a mysterious note Cassandra's mother left her: "Find the babysitters. Love, Mom."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, Esme and Cassandra have more in common than they think, and they're about to discover what being a babysitter really means: a heroic lineage of superpowers, magic rituals, and saving the innocent from seriously terrifying evil. And all before the parents get home.</description>

  <description>On the edge of town a beast haunts the woods, trapped in the Gray, its bonds loosening…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uprooted from the city, Violet Saunders doesn’t have much hope of fitting in at her new school in Four Paths, a town almost buried in the woodlands of rural New York. The fact that she’s descended from one of the town’s founders doesn’t help much, either—her new neighbours treat her with distant respect, and something very like fear. When she meets Justin, May, Isaac, and Harper, all children of founder families, and sees the otherworldly destruction they can wreak, she starts to wonder if the townsfolk are right to be afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When bodies start to appear in the woods, the locals become downright hostile. Can the teenagers solve the mystery of Four Paths, and their own part in it, before another calamity strikes?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; 00 p.m.: &lt;/i&gt;Lucky is the biggest K-pop star on the scene, and she's just performed her hit song "Heartbeat" in Hong Kong to thousands of adoring fans. She's about to debut on &lt;i&gt;The Tonight Show &lt;/i&gt;in America, hopefully a breakout performance for her career. But right now? She's in her fancy hotel, trying to fall asleep but dying for a hamburger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; 00 p.m.: &lt;/i&gt;Jack is sneaking into a fancy hotel, on assignment for his tabloid job that he keeps secret from his parents. On his way out of the hotel, he runs into a girl wearing slippers, a girl who is single-mindedly determined to find a hamburger. She looks kind of familiar. She's very cute. He's maybe curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;12:00 a.m.: &lt;/i&gt;Nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>Best friends are forged by fire. For Winona Olsen and Lucille Pryce, that fire happened the night they met outside the police station—both deciding whether to turn their families in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winona has been starving for life in the seemingly perfect home that she shares with her seemingly perfect father, celebrity weatherman Stormy Olsen. No one knows that he locks the pantry door to control her eating and leaves bruises where no one can see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucille has been suffocating beneath the needs of her mother and her drug-dealing brother, wondering if there’s more out there for her than disappearing waitress tips and generations of barely getting by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One harrowing night, Winona and Lucille realize they can’t wait until graduation to start their new lives. They need out. Now. All they need is three grand, fast. And really, a stolen convertible to take them from Michigan to Las Vegas can’t hurt.</description>

  <description>When a guy named Martin Nathaniel Munroe II texts you, it should be obvious who you're talking to. Except there's two of them (it's a long story), and Haley thinks she's talking to the one she doesn't hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A question about a class project rapidly evolves into an all-consuming conversation. Haley finds that Martin is actually willing to listen to her weird facts and unusual obsessions, and Martin feels like Haley is the first person to really see who he is. Haley and Martin might be too awkward to hang out in real life, but over text, they're becoming addicted to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem: Haley &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; know who Martin is. And Martin doesn't know that Haley doesn't know. But they better figure it out fast before their meet-cute becomes an epic meet-disaster . . .</description>

  <description>Roses are read, violets are blue, if you hurt us, we’re coming for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeply secretive Black Coats have been exacting vengeance on men who hurt girls and women for years. And Thea has just received an invitation to join them. This is the opportunity she’s been waiting for to finally get justice for her cousin Natalie, whose killer went free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea dives head first into the group, training every day with other girls whose stories rival hers. Together they carry out Balancings—acts of revenge guaranteed to teach a lesson. With every predator threatened, every blackmailer exposed, and every date rapist punished, Thea can feel herself getting closer to avenging Natalie’s death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the Balancings begin to escalate in brutality, and Thea discovers that the Black Coats are not all they seem to be. Thea must confront just how far she’s willing to go for justice—and what kind of justice Natalie, and Thea herself, deserve. Because when the line between justice and revenge is razor thin, it’s hard not to get cut.</description>

  <description>A music-loving teen with OCD does everything she can to find her way back to her mother during the historic race riots in 1969 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in this heart-pounding literary debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melati Ahmad looks like your typical moviegoing, Beatles-obsessed sixteen-year-old. Unlike most other sixteen-year-olds though, Mel also believes that she harbors a djinn inside her, one who threatens her with horrific images of her mother’s death unless she adheres to an elaborate ritual of counting and tapping to keep him satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are things that Melati can't protect her mother from. On the evening of May 13th, 1969, racial tensions in her home city of Kuala Lumpur boil over. The Chinese and Malays are at war, and Mel and her mother become separated by a city in flames. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a 24-hour curfew in place and all lines of communication down, it will take the help of a Chinese boy named Vincent and all of the courage and grit in Melati’s arsenal to overcome the violence on the streets, her own prejudices, and her djinn’s surging power to make it back to the one person she can’t risk losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Content warnings: Racism, graphic violence, on-page death, OCD and anxiety triggers.**</description>

  <description>Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions—like grief. And love. He thinks he’s defective. His family knows better—that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can’t turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn’t go as planned. Esme’s lessons in love seem to be working…but only on herself. She’s hopelessly smitten with a man who’s convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Esme’s time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he’s been wrong all along. And there’s more than one way to love.</description>

      <![CDATA[3-3.5 stars.<br /><br />I definitely think this is a situation where the book just wasn't for me. It took me about a week and a half to finish this on audio, which is a long time for me. It was just a mix of me being in a reading slump and as well as...not much happening throughout the novel.<br...]]>

  <description>Being the kid abducted by old Ms. Easton when he was four permanently set Cole's status to freak. At seventeen, his exit plan is simple: make it through the last few weeks of high school with his grades up and his head down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he pushes through the front door of the school and finds himself eighty kilometers away holding the door of a museum he was just thinking about, Cole faces facts: he's either more deluded than old Ms. Easton, or he just teleported. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now every door is an accident waiting to happen―especially when Cole thinks about Malik, who, it turns out, has a glass door on his shower. When he starts seeing the same creepy people over his shoulder, no matter how far he's gone, crushes become the least of his worries. They want him to stop, and they'll go to any length to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole is running out of luck, excuses, and places to hide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time for a new exit plan.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;This Savage Song&lt;/i&gt; in this dark fantasy about a girl who sells magical body parts on the black market — until she’s betrayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita doesn’t murder supernatural beings and sell their body parts on the internet—her mother does that. Nita just dissects the bodies after they’ve been “acquired.” But when her mom brings home a live specimen, Nita decides she wants out — dissecting living people is a step too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she tries to save her mother’s victim, she ends up sold on the black market in his place — because Nita herself is a supernatural being. Now Nita is on the other side of the bars, and there is no line she won’t cross to escape and make sure no one can ever capture her again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita did a good deed, and it cost her everything. Now she’s going to do a lot of bad deeds to get it all back.</description>

  <description>Anda loves Coarsegold Online, the massively-multiplayer role-playing game where she spends most of her free time. It's a place where she can be a leader, a fighter, a hero. It's a place where she can meet people from all over the world, and make friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things become a lot more complicated when Anda befriends a gold farmer--a poor Chinese kid whose avatar in the game illegally collects valuable objects and then sells them to players from developed countries with money to burn. This behavior is strictly against the rules in Coarsegold, but Anda soon comes to realize that questions of right and wrong are a lot less straightforward when a real person's real livelihood is at stake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed teen author (&lt;i&gt;Little Brother&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;For the Win&lt;/i&gt;) and Boing Boing editor Cory Doctorow and &lt;i&gt;Koko Be Good&lt;/i&gt; creator Jen Wang, &lt;i&gt;In Real Life&lt;/i&gt; is a perceptive and high-stakes look at adolescence, gaming, poverty, and culture clash.</description>

  <description>In six essays united by a common theme, Kathleen Hale traces some of the most treacherous fault lines in modern America—from sexual assault to Internet trolling, from environmental illness to our own animal nature. In these wide-ranging pieces, Hale proves herself to be an exhilarating new voice whose writing is both fearless and profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “First I Got Pregnant. Then I Decided to Kill the Mountain Lion,” Hale recounts the month she spent tracking a wild cat lost in the Hollywood Hills while pregnant; in “Prey,” she tells the troubling story of her sexual assault as a freshman in college; other essays recount the mesmerizing stories of a trip to hunt wild hogs in Florida, and a standoff with an anonymous blogger. On the surface, Hale’s writing is deeply personal, but these essays also tell thought-provoking stories of predators and prey. Taking no prisoners and fearing no subject matter, Kathleen Hale wields razor-sharp wit, uncommon levels of empathy, and daring honesty, even in detailing some of the most difficult moments of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, candid, and sometimes unsettling, Kathleen Hale Is a Crazy Stalker introduces an arresting and unusual new voice for this strange American century.</description>

  <description>In The New Girl, there's a new girl at Midtown High. Her name's Gwen Stacy, and she has her sights set on Peter Parker. What's a lovesick Mary Jane to do? Plus: Mary Jane Watson wasn't always the girl she is today. How did she become the sort of person to push her problems away rather than face them? And how is it that Peter Parker, Spider-Man and Spidey's origin itself all play pivotal roles? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In My Secret Life, take a look at Mary Jane through the eyes of her supporting cast. What do they think of her, especially now that she's...changed? And what does this change mean for her relationship with Peter Parker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in Still Friends, what's the story between Mary Jane and Peter in the aftermath of recent shocking revelations? Between Peter and Gwen? Between Liz and - Oh, who CARES? Is that FIRESTAR? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&lt;/i&gt; 6-20</description>

  <description>Nate never imagined that he would be attacked by his best friend, Cam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Nate is being called to deliver a sworn statement that will get Cam convicted. The problem is, the real story isn’t that easy or convenient—just like Nate and Cam’s friendship. Cam challenged Nate on every level from the day the boys met. He pushed him to break the rules, to dream, and to accept himself. But Nate—armed with a fierce moral code and conflicted by his own beliefs—started to push back. With each push, Nate and Cam moved closer to each other—but also spiraled closer to their breaking points.</description>

  <description>Bombshell is back, and young heroes are debuting all across the city - including Cloak &amp;amp; Dagger and Ultimate Power Pack! But can Miles continue on being Spider-Man after everything that's happened, or will tragedy force him to quit? Cloak &amp;amp; Dagger try to bring Miles back into the super hero fold, but when Miles comes face-to-face with the evil of Roxxon, he makes his final decision. Roxxon created Venom, and because of Venom, Miles' mother died. Now Miles will unleash hell. But will even Cloak, Dagger, Bombshell and Spider-Woman be enough to help him take Roxxon down? The first chapter in the Miles Morales saga ends with a bang as Miles discovers one of the big secrets of his origin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&lt;/i&gt; 23-28</description>

      <![CDATA[4 stars. <br /><br /><br />This was a really fun series. My only issue with the later volumes is that I just don't care about the new heros, no matter how hard I try. I think I'll pick up Miles' next series, but we'll see.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;Love, Simon &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Eleanor and Park&lt;/i&gt;, a romantic and sweet novel about a transgender boy who falls in love for the first time—and how first love changes us all—from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Amber Smith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris and Maia aren’t off to a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A near-fatal car accident first brings them together, and their next encounters don’t fare much better. Chris’s good intentions backfire. Maia’s temper gets the best of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they’re neighbors, at least for the summer, and despite their best efforts, they just can’t seem to stay away from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path forward isn’t easy. Chris has come out as transgender, but he’s still processing a frightening assault he survived the year before. Maia is grieving the loss of her older sister and trying to find her place in the world without her. Falling in love was the last thing on either of their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But would it be so bad if it happened anyway?</description>

  <description>With her daughter to care for and her abuela to help support, high school senior Emoni Santiago has to make the tough decisions, and do what must be done. The one place she can let her responsibilities go is in the kitchen, where she adds a little something magical to everything she cooks, turning her food into straight-up goodness. Still, she knows she doesn’t have enough time for her school’s new culinary arts class, doesn’t have the money for the class’s trip to Spain — and shouldn’t still be dreaming of someday working in a real kitchen. But even with all the rules she has for her life — and all the rules everyone expects her to play by — once Emoni starts cooking, her only real choice is to let her talent break free.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My first time getting it in the butt was kind of weird. I think it's going to be weird for everyone's first time, though.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Jack Rothman. He's seventeen and loves partying, makeup and boys - sometimes all at the same time. His sex life makes him &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;hot topic for the high school gossip machine. But who cares? Like Jack always says, 'it could be worse'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn't actually expect that to come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after Jack starts writing an online sex advice column, the mysterious love letters he's been getting take a turn for the creepy. Jack's secret admirer knows everything: where he's hanging out, who he's sleeping with, who his mum is dating. They claim they love Jack, but not his unashamedly queer lifestyle. They need him to curb his sexuality, or they'll force him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the pressure mounts, Jack must unmask his stalker before their obsession becomes genuinely dangerous...</description>

  <description>When a tornado rips through town, twelve-year-old Ivy Aberdeen's house is destroyed and her family of five is displaced. Ivy feels invisible and ignored in the aftermath of the storm--and what's worse, her notebook filled with secret drawings of girls holding hands has gone missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mysteriously, Ivy's drawings begin to reappear in her locker with notes from someone telling her to open up about her identity. Ivy thinks--and hopes--that this someone might be her classmate, another girl for whom Ivy has begun to develop a crush. Will Ivy find the strength and courage to follow her true feelings?</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>The year is 1973. The Watergate hearings are in full swing. The Vietnam War is still raging. And homosexuality is still officially considered a mental illness. In the midst of these trying times is sixteen-year-old Jonathan Collins, a bullied, anxious, asthmatic kid, who aside from an alcoholic father and his sympathetic neighbor and friend Starla, is completely alone. To cope, Jonathan escapes to the safe haven of his imagination, where his hero David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust and dead relatives, including his mother, guide him through the rough terrain of his life. In his alternate reality, Jonathan can be anything: a superhero, an astronaut, Ziggy Stardust, himself, or completely “normal” and not a boy who likes other boys. When he completes his treatments, he will be normal—at least he hopes. But before that can happen, Web stumbles into his life. Web is everything Jonathan wishes he could be: fearless, fearsome and, most importantly, not ashamed of being gay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan doesn’t want to like brooding Web, who has secrets all his own. Jonathan wants nothing more than to be “fixed” once and for all. But he’s drawn to Web anyway. Web is the first person in the real world to see Jonathan completely and think he’s perfect. Web is a kind of escape Jonathan has never known. For the first time in his life, he may finally feel free enough to love and accept himself as he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poignant coming-of-age tale, Ziggy, Stardust and Me heralds the arrival of a stunning and important new voice in YA.</description>

  <description>It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>When Chris joins the staff at her local record store, she’s surprised to find out that her co-workers share a secret: they’re all members of a secret fight club that take on the patriarchy and fight crime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starry-eyed Chris has just started the dream job every outcast kid in town wants: working at Vinyl Mayhem. It's as rad as she imagined; her boss is BOSS, her co-workers spend their time arguing over music, pushing against the patriarchy, and endlessly trying to form a band. When Rosie Riot, the staff's favorite singer, mysteriously vanishes the night before her band’s show, Chris discovers her co-workers are doing more than just sorting vinyl . . . Her local indie record store is also a front for a teen girl vigilante fight club! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Follow writer Carly Usdin (director of &lt;i&gt;Suicide Kale&lt;/i&gt;) and artist Nina Vakueva (&lt;i&gt;Lilith’s World&lt;/i&gt;) into the &lt;i&gt;Hi-Fi Fight Club&lt;/i&gt;, where they deliver a rock and roll tale of intrigue and boundless friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A crucial, genre-bending tale, equal parts Ned Vizzini and Patrick Ness, about the life-saving power of friendship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solomon and Ash both experienced a traumatic event when they were twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash lost all memory of that event when she fell from Solomon’s treehouse. Since then, Solomon has retreated further and further into a world he seems to have created in his own mind. One that insulates him from reality, but crawls with foes and monsters . . . in both animal and human form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Solomon slips further into the place he calls Darkside, Ash realizes her only chance to free her best friend from his pain is to recall exactly what happened that day in his backyard and face the truth—together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearless and profound, Sam J. Miller’s follow up to his award-winning debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Starving,&lt;/em&gt; spins an intimate and impactful tale that will linger with readers.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Rukhsana Ali tries her hardest to live up to her conservative Muslim parents’ expectations, but lately she’s finding that harder and harder to do. She rolls her eyes instead of screaming when they blatantly favor her brother and she dresses conservatively at home, saving her crop tops and makeup for parties her parents don’t know about. Luckily, only a few more months stand between her carefully monitored life in Seattle and her new life at Caltech, where she can pursue her dream of becoming an engineer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her parents catch her kissing her girlfriend Ariana, all of Rukhsana’s plans fall apart. Her parents are devastated; being gay may as well be a death sentence in the Bengali community. They immediately whisk Rukhsana off to Bangladesh, where she is thrown headfirst into a world of arranged marriages and tradition. Only through reading her grandmother’s old diary is Rukhsana able to gain some much needed perspective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rukhsana realizes she must find the courage to fight for her love, but can she do so without losing everyone and everything in her life?</description>

My only qualms with it though are that the writing is very...average, and the pacing definitely had it's rough moments.<br /><br />Still highly recommend for those who are searching for a new F/F romance! Just be warned that it's actually very dark.<br...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’d give his life to protect the president’s son. But he never expected to risk his heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up gay in the White House hasn’t been easy for Rafael Castillo. Codenamed “Valor” by the Secret Service, Rafa feels anything but brave as he hides in the closet and tries to stay below the radar in his last year of college. His father’s presidency is almost over, and he just needs to stick to his carefully crafted plan. Once his family’s out of the spotlight, he can be honest with his conservative parents about his sexuality and his dream of being a chef. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s definitely not part of Rafa’s plan to get a new Secret Service agent who’s a walking wet dream, but he’s made it this long keeping his desires to himself. Besides, it’s not like Shane Kendrick would even look at him twice if it wasn’t his job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane’s worked his way up through the Secret Service ranks, and while protecting the president’s shy, boring son isn’t his dream White House assignment, it’s an easy enough task since no one pays Rafa much attention. He discovers there’s a vibrant young man beneath the timid public shell, and while he knows Rafa has a crush on him, he assures himself it’s harmless. Shane’s never had room for romance in his life, and he’d certainly never cross that line with a protectee. Keeping Rafa safe at any cost is Shane’s mission. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Rafa gets under his skin, will they both put their hearts on the line?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gay romance from Keira Andrews is the first part of the &lt;i&gt;Valor&lt;/i&gt; duology and features a May-December age difference, Jane Austen levels of pining, forbidden love against the odds, and of course a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Helloooo, Internet Land. Bitty here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y’all... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;not be ready for this. I may be a former junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;talented amateur pâtissier, but being a freshman on the Samwell University hockey team is a whole new challenge. It’s nothing like co-ed club hockey back in Georgia! First of all? There’s &lt;em&gt;checking.&lt;/em&gt; And then, there is Jack—our very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the megapopular webcomic series of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Check, Please!: #Hockey&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Do you know what it feels like to be forgotten?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold winter night, Iris and her best friend, Daniel, sneak into a clearing in the woods to play in the freshly fallen snow. There, Iris carefully makes a perfect snow angel - only to find the crumbling gravestone of a young girl, Avery Moore, right beneath her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, strange things start to happen to Iris: She begins having vivid nightmares. She wakes up to find her bedroom window wide open, letting in the snow. She thinks she sees the shadow of a girl lurking in the woods. And she feels the pull of the abandoned grave, calling her back to the clearing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsessed with figuring out what's going on, Iris and Daniel start to research the area for a school project. They discover that Avery's grave is actually part of a neglected and forgotten Black cemetery, dating back to a time when White and Black people were kept separate in life - and in death. As Iris and Daniel learn more about their town's past, they become determined to restore Avery's grave and finally have proper respect paid to Avery and the others buried there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they have awakened a jealous and demanding ghost, one that's not satisfied with their plans for getting recognition. One that is searching for a best friend forever - no matter what the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forgotten Girl&lt;/i&gt; is both a spooky original ghost story and a timely and important storyline about reclaiming an abandoned segregated cemetery.</description>

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking beneath Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery. But time is running out, and the spirit is only growing stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Cass fails, the force she's unleashed could haunt the city forever.</description>

  <description>Just know from the start that it wasn’t supposed to go like this. All we wanted was to get near them. That’s why we got a room in the hotel where they were staying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were not planning to kidnap one of them. Especially not the most useless one. But we had him—his room key, his cell phone, and his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were not planning on what happened next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From thrilling new talent Goldy Moldavsky comes a pitch-black, hilarious take on fandom and the badass girls who have the power to make—or break—the people we call “celebrities.”</description>

I LOVE the mix between murderous characters and laughs, and a lot of times horror comedies allow it to get even darker than normal horror.

  <description>It's been six weeks since angels of the apocalypse descended to demolish the modern world. Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival. Together, they journey toward the angels' stronghold in San Francisco where she'll risk everything to rescue her sister and he'll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.</description>

  <description>Becca Chandler is suddenly getting all the guys-- the ones she &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; want. Ever since her ex-boyfriend spread those lies about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she saves Chris Merrick from a beating in the school parking lot. Chris is different. Way different: he can control water--just like his brothers can control fire, wind, and earth. They're powerful. Dangerous. Marked for death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that she knows the truth, so is Becca. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets are hard to keep when your life's at stake. When Hunter, the mysterious new kid around school, turns up with a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, Becca thinks she can trust him. But then Hunter goes head-to-head with Chris, and Becca wonders who's hiding the most dangerous truth of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storm is coming. . .</description>

  <description>One night in March, a terrible tragedy shakes the Queens neighborhood where Jessica Nolan and Lucas Rossi live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year since the shooting has played out differently for Jess and Lucas, both of whom were affected by that night in eerily similar, and deeply personal, ways. Lucas has taken up boxing and lives under the ever-watchful eye of his overprotective parents, while trying to put good into the world through random acts of kindness — to pay back a debt he feels he owes the universe for taking the wrong brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jess struggles to take care of her depressed mother, with the help of her elderly next-door neighbor, and tries to make ends meet. Without her best friend, who’s across the country at a special post-trauma boarding school, and her brother, who died that night, Jess feels totally alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jess and Lucas's paths cross at their shared after-school job, they start to become friends… and then more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their community — and their families — were irrevocably changed by a senseless act of violence. But as Jess and Lucas fall in love, they'll learn to help each other heal and move forward — together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Night&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional and ultimately hopeful story about tragedy, love, and learning to heal.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Emotional and painful but also layered with humour, &lt;i&gt;I'm Afraid of Men&lt;/i&gt; will widen your lens on gender and challenge you to do better. This challenge is a necessary one—one we must all take up. It is a gift to dive into Vivek's heart and mind."&lt;br /&gt; —Rupi Kaur, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Sun and Her Flowers &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Milk and Honey&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trans artist explores how masculinity was imposed on her as a boy and continues to haunt her as a girl--and how we might reimagine gender for the twenty-first century&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivek Shraya has reason to be afraid. Throughout her life she's endured acts of cruelty and aggression for being too feminine as a boy and not feminine enough as a girl. In order to survive childhood, she had to learn to convincingly perform masculinity. As an adult, she makes daily compromises to steel herself against everything from verbal attacks to heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with raw honesty, Shraya delivers an important record of the cumulative damage caused by misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia, releasing trauma from a body that has always refused to assimilate. &lt;i&gt;I'm Afraid of Men&lt;/i&gt; is a journey from camouflage to a riot of colour and a blueprint for how we might cherish all that makes us different and conquer all that makes us afraid.</description>

  <description>Senior Ariel Stone is the perfect college applicant: first chair violin, dedicated community volunteer, and expected valedictorian. He works hard - really hard - to make his life look effortless. A failed Calculus quiz is not part of that plan. Not when he’s number one. Not when his peers can smell weakness like a freshman’s body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figuring a few all-nighters will preserve his class rank, Ariel throws himself into studying. His friends will understand if he skips a few plans, and he can sleep when he graduates. Except Ariel’s grade continues to slide. Reluctantly, he gets a tutor. Amir and Ariel have never gotten along, but Amir excels in Calculus, and Ariel is out of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariel may not like Calc, but he might like Amir. Except adding a new relationship to his long list of commitments may just push him past his limit.</description>

  <description>A killer is on the loose, and only one girl has the power to find him. But in this genre-bending YA thriller, she must first manage to avoid becoming a target herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Adele, the dead aren’t really dead. She can see them and even talk to them. But she’s spent years denying her gift. When she encounters her ex best friend Tori in a shallow grave in the woods and realizes that Tori is actually dead -- that gift turns into a curse. Without an alibi, Adele becomes the prime suspect in Tori’s murder. She must work with Tori’s ghost to find the real killer. But what if the killer finds Adele first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master mystery-write April Henry adds a chilling paranormal twist to this incredibly suspenseful young adult novel.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Veronica Clarke never thought she would wish she’d failed a test until she finds herself holding a thick piece of plastic in her hands and staring at two solid pink lines. Even the most consistent use of condoms won’t prevent pregnancy when your boyfriend secretly pokes holes in them to keep you from going out-of-state for college. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica needs an abortion, but the closest place she can legally get one is over nine hundred miles away—and Veronica doesn’t have a car. Too ashamed to ask her friends or family for help, Veronica turns to the one person she believes won’t judge her: Bailey Butler, Jefferson High’s own little black cloud of anger and snark—and Veronica’s ex-best friend. Once on the road, Veronica quickly remembers nothing with Bailey is ever simple and that means two days of stolen cars, shotguns, crazed ex-boyfriends, truck stop strippers with pro-life agendas, and a limo driver named Bob. But the pain and betrayal of their broken friendship can’t be outrun. When their fighting leads to a brutal moment of truth, Bailey abandons Veronica. Now Veronica must risk everything in order to repair the hurt she’s caused</description>

  <description>Hen and her husband Lloyd have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby, and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago.

      <![CDATA[4 stars.<br /><br />I REALLY enjoyed this for about the first half, but all of the hype about the plot twist killed it for me. Yes, I didn't see it coming, but I've seen the same thing in many other thrillers so its definitely not anything original. It's also pretty disrespectful and not great re...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month! A captivating and powerful exploration of the opioid crisis—the deadliest drug epidemic in American history—through the eyes of a college-bound softball star. Edgar Award-winning author Mindy McGinnis delivers a visceral and necessary novel about addiction, family, friendship, and hope. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a car crash sidelines Mickey just before softball season, she has to find a way to hold on to her spot as the catcher for a team expected to make a historic tournament run. Behind the plate is the only place she’s ever felt comfortable, and the painkillers she’s been prescribed can help her get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills do more than take away pain; they make her feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new circle of friends—fellow injured athletes, others with just time to kill—Mickey finds peaceful acceptance, and people with whom words come easily, even if it is just the pills loosening her tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the pressure to be Mickey Catalan heightens, her need increases, and it becomes less about pain and more about want, something that could send her spiraling out of control.</description>

  <description>Owen and his best friend, Sean, are both eleven years old. They've lived on Cape Cod all their lives, and now that they're a little older, they'll finally be free to spend some time on their own. But Sean's mother has a different idea--she hires a babysitter to look after Sean. Paul is in his twenties, and a well-liked guy from church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul starts doing things that just feel wrong. Because they've always been as close as brothers, Sean tells Owen, and no one else. What's not certain to Owen is what he should do. Sean warns him not to tell anyone what is happening. But if Owen doesn't tell, could something even worse happen to Sean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This harrowing and sensitively told tale of child abuse is a must-read for anyone who might ever be called upon to help a friend in need.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“This isn’t meant to be a confession. Not in any spiritual sense of the word. Yes, I’m in jail at the moment. I imagine I’ll be here for a long time, considering. But I’m not writing this down for absolution and I’m not seeking forgiveness, not even from myself. Because I’m not sorry for what I did to Rose. I’m just not. Not for any of it.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Gibson is many things, but he’s not sorry and he’s not a liar. He will tell you exactly how what started as a simple school camping trip in the mountains ended the way it did. About who lived and who died. About who killed and who had the best of intentions. And he’ll tell you about Rose. But he’s going to tell you in his own time. Because after what happened on that mountain, time is the one thing he has plenty of.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, back at Darrow-Harker School, Beatrice Hartley and her five best friends were the cool kids, the beautiful ones. Then the shocking death of Jim - their creative genius and Beatrice's boyfriend - changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year after graduation, Beatrice is returning to Wincroft - the seaside estate where they spent so many nights sharing secrets, crushes, plans to change the world - hoping she'll get to the bottom of the dark questions gnawing at her about Jim's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the night plays out in a haze of stilted jokes and unfathomable silence, Beatrice senses she's never going to know what really happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a mysterious man knocks on the door. Blithely, he announces the impossible: time for them has become stuck, snagged on a splinter that can only be removed if the former friends make the harshest of decisions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Beatrice has one last shot at answers... and at life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so begins the Neverworld Wake.</description>

  <description>In her blazingly original and unforgettable debut novel "Any Man", Amber Tamblyn brings to startling life a specter of sexual violence in the shadowy form of Maude, a serial female rapist who preys on men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this electric and provocative debut novel, Tamblyn blends genres of poetry, prose, and elements of suspense to give shape to the shocking narratives of victims of sexual violence, mapping the destructive ways in which our society perpetuates rape culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A violent serial rapist is on the loose, who goes by the name Maude. She hunts for men at bars, online, at home— the place doesn’t matter, neither does the man. Her victims then must live the aftermath of their assault in the form of doubt from the police, feelings of shame alienation from their friends and family and the haunting of a horrible woman who becomes the phantom on which society projects its greatest fears, fascinations and even misogyny. All the while the police are without leads and the media hound the victims, publicly dissecting the details of their attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is extraordinary is how as years pass these men learn to heal, by banding together and finding a space to raise their voices. Told in alternating viewpoints signature to each voice and experience of the victim, these pages crackle with emotion, ranging from horror to breathtaking empathy.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old Aru Shah has a tendency to stretch the truth in order to fit in at school. While her classmates are jetting off to family vacations in exotic locales, she'll be spending her autumn break at home, in the Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture, waiting for her mom to return from her latest archeological trip. Is it any wonder that Aru makes up stories about being royalty, traveling to Paris, and having a chauffeur?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, three schoolmates show up at Aru's doorstep to catch her in a lie. They don't believe her claim that the museum's Lamp of Bharata is cursed, and they dare Aru to prove it. &lt;i&gt;Just a quick light,&lt;/i&gt; Aru thinks. Then she can get herself out of this mess and &lt;i&gt;never ever&lt;/i&gt; fib again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lighting the lamp has dire consequences. She unwittingly frees the Sleeper, an ancient demon whose duty it is to awaken the God of Destruction. Her classmates and beloved mother are frozen in time, and it's up to Aru to save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to stop the demon is to find the reincarnations of the five legendary Pandava brothers, protagonists of the Hindu epic poem, the &lt;i&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/i&gt;, and journey through the Kingdom of Death. But how is one girl in Spider-Man pajamas supposed to do all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;?</description>

  <description>When his dad is caught embezzling funds from half the town, Rob goes from popular lacrosse player to social pariah. Even worse, his father’s failed suicide attempt leaves Rob and his mother responsible for his care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks of Maegan as a typical overachiever, but she has a secret of her own after the pressure got to her last year. And when her sister comes home from college pregnant, keeping it from her parents might be more than she can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rob and Maegan are paired together for a calculus project, they’re both reluctant to let anyone through the walls they’ve built. But when Maegan learns of Rob’s plan to fix the damage caused by his father, it could ruin more than their fragile new friendship...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This captivating, heartfelt novel asks the question: Is it okay to do something wrong for the right reasons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9781681198095.

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Seelie Stanton never wanted to kill someone. She never wanted to be invisible in her own family, never wanted to crush on her best friend Alyssa, and she definitely never wanted to know how effectively a mallet could destroy someone’s head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the universe doesn’t care what she wants. Shane Mayfield doesn’t care what Seelie wants either. When the former high school basketball star attacks her, she has no choice but to defend herself. She saved her own life, but she can’t bring herself to talk about what happened that night. Not all of it. Not even when she’s arrested for murder.</description>

  <description>When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drought—or the Tap-Out, as everyone calls it—has been going on for a while now. Everyone’s lives have become an endless list of don’ts: don’t water the lawn, don’t fill up your pool, don’t take long showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the taps run dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Alyssa’s quiet suburban street spirals into a warzone of desperation; neighbors and families turned against each other on the hunt for water. And when her parents don’t return and her life—and the life of her brother—is threatened, Alyssa has to make impossible choices if she’s going to survive.</description>

  <description>When reclusive novelist Senna Richards wakes up on her thirty-third birthday, everything has changed. Caged behind an electrical fence, locked in a house in the middle of the snow, Senna is left to decode the clues to find out why she was taken. If she wants her freedom, she has to take a close look at her past. But, her past has a heartbeat... and her kidnapper is nowhere to be found. With her survival hanging by a thread, Senna soon realizes this is a game. A dangerous one. Only the truth can set her free.</description>

  <description>Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspecters, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts. In fact, her best friend, Jacob, just happens to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Inspecters head to ultra-haunted Edinburgh, Scotland, for their new TV show, Cass—and Jacob—come along. In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil. Cass isn't sure about her new mission, but she does know the sinister Red Raven haunting the city doesn't belong in her world. Cassidy's powers will draw her into an epic fight that stretches through the worlds of the living and the dead, in order to save herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In spare, poignant, direct prose, &lt;i&gt;I Hate Everyone&lt;/i&gt; paints a nuanced and honest portrait of the complex emotional lives of children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I hate everyone." In your worst mood, it's a phrase you might want to shout out loud, even if, deep down, you don't really mean it. Set at a birthday party, this disgruntled, first-person story portrays the confusing feelings that sometimes make it impossible to be nice, even--or especially--when everyone else is in a partying mode. A gorgeous, poetic contemplation, sure to elicit a reaction from readers. A worthy successor to &lt;i&gt;Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Home, love, and possibilities he never imagined are waiting for Billy Joe to claim them. But first he needs to escape the horrors of his past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A twisted act of cruelty and prejudice drives Billy Joe from his Mississippi home, and he makes it as far as Pennsylvania—where his car breaks down just as the year’s first snowstorm blows in. Fortunately, Carlos is there to lend a hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carlos is no stranger to hardship. His family rejected him for being gay, but with determination, he put himself through school and became a librarian. Carlos sees the same willpower in Billy, and he wants to help Billy and his son succeed in a new life that is very different from the one they left behind. With his support, they start to adjust, and before long, both men want more than encouragement from each other. They want the chance for a future together, but their families have other ideas… and Billy’s will stop at nothing to get what they want.</description>

  <description>In the wake of tragedy, SEAL Mark Whitley rushed stateside to act as guardian to his sister’s three young children. But a conflicting will could give custody to someone else—someone Mark remembers as a too young, too hot, wild party boy. Even after six years, Mark can’t shake the memory of his close encounter with Isaiah James, or face up to what it says about his own sexuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaiah’s totally over the crush that made him proposition Mark all those years ago. In fact, he’s done with crushing on the wrong men altogether. For now, he’s throwing himself into proving he’s the best person to care for his cousin’s kids. But there’s no denying there’s something sexy about a big, tough military man with a baby in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the legal details get sorted out, their long-buried attraction resurfaces, leading to intimate evenings after the kids are tucked in. A forever future is within reach for all of them, if only Mark can find the courage he needs to trust Isaiah with his secrets—and his heart.</description>

  <description>Henry Page has never been in love. He fancies himself a hopeless romantic, but the slo-mo, heart palpitating, can't-eat-can't-sleep kind of love that he's been hoping for just hasn't been in the cards for him-at least not yet. Instead, he's been happy to focus on his grades, on getting into a semi-decent college and finally becoming editor of his school newspaper. Then Grace Town walks into his first period class on the third Tuesday of senior year and he knows everything's about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace isn't who Henry pictured as his dream girl-she walks with a cane, wears oversized boys' clothes, and rarely seems to shower. But when Grace and Henry are both chosen to edit the school paper, he quickly finds himself falling for her. It's obvious there's something broken about Grace, but it seems to make her even more beautiful to Henry, and he wants nothing more than to help her put the pieces back together again. And yet, this isn't your average story of boy meets girl. Krystal Sutherland's brilliant debut is equal parts wit and heartbreak, a potent reminder of the bittersweet bliss that is first love.</description>

  <description>There are two things Ben Lewis has convinced himself he can never have at the same time: playing hockey and being openly gay. Hockey is looking to be his only choice. Until now. Being captain of the team and starting his senior year of high school is a lot to handle. Throw in a budding friendship with his crush, Marcus, and Ben is faced with deciding if he’s brave enough to take the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, courage can come from unexpected places. His BFF Ryan, new friends, and a voice from the past are great assists to his determination to be true to himself and keep playing the game he loves, but will they be enough?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happened in high school stayed in high school. Until now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, Michael Graham betrayed the only person who ever really knew him. Since then, he’s made an art of hiding his sexuality from everyone. Including himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it’s a shock when his past strolls right into the Harkness College locker room, sporting a bag of hockey gear and the same slow smile that had always rendered Graham defenseless. For Graham, there is only one possible reaction: total, debilitating panic. With one loose word, the team’s new left wing could destroy Graham’s life as he knows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Rikker is stuck being the new guy. &lt;i&gt;Again.&lt;/i&gt; And it’s worse than usual, because the media has latched onto the story of the only “out” player in Division One hockey. As the satellite trucks line the sidewalk outside the rink, his new teammates are not amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one player in particular looks sick every time he enters the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rikker didn’t exactly expect a warm welcome from Graham. But the guy won’t even meet his eyes. From the looks of it, his former… best friend / boyfriend / whatever isn’t doing so well. He drinks too much and can’t focus during practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the two loneliest guys on the team will self destruct from all the new pressures in their lives, or they can navigate the pain to find a way back to one another. To say that it won’t be easy is the &lt;i&gt;Understatement of the Year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS BOOK IS A STANDALONE. NO CLIFFHANGERS. NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE NECESSARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; unlike the other books in this series, this heartbreaking love story is about two guys. Contains sexual situations, dance music, snarky t-shirts and a poker-playing grandmother.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this epistolary middle-grade debut novel, a girl who's questioning her sexual orientation writes letters to her sister, who was sent away from their strict Catholic home after becoming pregnant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven-year-old Evie is heartbroken when her strict Catholic parents send her pregnant sister away to stay with a distant great-aunt. All Evie wants is for her older sister to come back. But when her parents forbid her to even speak to Cilla, she starts sending letters. Evie writes letters about her family, torn apart and hurting. She writes about her life, empty without Cilla. And she writes about the new girl in school, June, who becomes her friend, and then maybe more than a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she becomes better friends with June, Evie begins to question her sexual orientation. She can only imagine what might happen if her parents found out who she really is. She could really use some advice from Cilla. But Cilla isn't writing back.</description>

  <description>Now that high school is over, Ari is dying to move to the big city with his ultra-hip band―if he can just persuade his dad to let him quit his job at their struggling family bakery. Though he loved working there as a kid, Ari cannot fathom a life wasting away over rising dough and hot ovens. But while interviewing candidates for his replacement, Ari meets Hector, an easygoing guy who loves baking as much as Ari wants to escape it. As they become closer over batches of bread, love is ready to bloom . . . that is, if Ari doesn’t ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer Kevin Panetta and artist Savanna Ganucheau concoct a delicious recipe of intricately illustrated baking scenes and blushing young love, in which the choices we make can have terrible consequences, but the people who love us can help us grow.</description>

  <description>After his dad commits suicide, Will tries to overcome his own misery by secretly helping the people around him in this story made up of one hundred chapters of one hundred words each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Will spends most of his days the same way: Working at the Dollar Only store, trying to replicate his late father’s famous cornbread recipe, and walking the streets of Los Angeles. Will started walking after his father committed suicide, and three years later he hasn’t stopped. But there are some places Will can’t walk by: The blessings store with the chest of 100 Chinese blessings in the back, the bridge on Fourth Street where his father died, and his childhood friend Playa’s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Will learns Playa was raped at a party—a party he was at, where he saw Playa, and where he believes he could have stopped the worst from happening if he hadn’t left early—it spurs Will to stop being complacent in his own sadness and do some good in the world. He begins to leave small gifts for everyone in his life, from Superman the homeless guy he passes on his way to work, to the Little Butterfly Dude he walks by on the way home, to Playa herself. And it is through those acts of kindness that Will is finally able to push past his own trauma and truly begin to live his life again. Oh, and discover the truth about that cornbread.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Your world is as you see it to be. Until it isn't.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the first words Kiva's best friend, Seth, says, after years of silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiva thought she was growing up in ancient Alexandria. That's what she and all her classmates had been led to believe by their parents. It turns out she was living in virtual reality, in a sleep chamber in deep space. She and Seth are among a handful of humans who continue to survive. Because Earth no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth was the first to wake up. Now it's Kiva's turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they must take an escape shuttle, nicknamed the Tomb, to search for the engine part their ship needs to keep running. But it's been a long time since their ship has communicated with any of the other vessels harboring human civilization. And not all the survivors are friendly...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; The stories never tell you what to do when the knight who rescues you turns out to be more dangerous than the dragon he saved you from. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sweetest Kind of Poison is a collection of poetry about toxic relationships and letting go of what no longer serves you. It takes you through the fall, the collapse, the withdrawal, the recovery, and the now, chronicling a journey of abuse, heartache, confidence, self-love, letting go, and growing up. Because sometimes only our darkest experiences can bring out our raw strength and help us find the people we are meant to be.</description>

  <description>Critically acclaimed author of We Are the Ants—described as having “hints of Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five” (School Library Journal)—opens up about what led to an attempted suicide in his teens, and his path back from the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wasn’t depressed because I was gay. I was depressed and gay.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaun David Hutchinson was nineteen. Confused. Struggling to find the vocabulary to understand and accept who he was and how he fit into a community in which he couldn’t see himself. The voice of depression told him that he would never be loved or wanted, while powerful and hurtful messages from society told him that being gay meant love and happiness weren’t for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A million moments large and small over the years all came together to convince Shaun that he couldn’t keep going, that he had no future. And so he followed through on trying to make that a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Shaun survived, and over time, came to embrace how grateful he is and how to find self-acceptance. In this courageous and deeply honest memoir, Shaun takes readers through the journey of what brought him to the edge, and what has helped him truly believe that it does get better.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Joe hasn't seen his brother in ten years. Ed didn't walk out on the family, not exactly. It's something more brutal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed's locked up -- on death row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now his execution date has been set, and the clock is ticking. Joe is determined to spend those last weeks with his brother, no matter what other people think ... and no matter whether Ed committed the crime. But did he? And does it matter, in the end? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This poignant, timely, heartbreaking novel asks big questions: What value do you place on life? What can you forgive? And just how do you say goodbye?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fall in love, break the curse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she’s instead somehow sucked into Rhen’s cursed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break the curse, save the kingdom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince? A monster? A curse? Harper doesn’t know where she is or what to believe. But as she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what’s at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.</description>

  <description>Earth. Fire. Air. Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One misstep and they lose it all. For the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Merrick understands pressure. He's the only parent his three brothers have had for years. His power to control Earth could kill someone if he miscalculates. Now an Elemental Guide has it in for his family, and he's all that stands in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His girlfriend, Hannah, understands pressure too. She's got a child of her own, and a job as a firefighter that could put her life in danger at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are people who have had enough of Michael's defiance, his family's 'bad luck'. Before he knows it, Michael's enemies have turned into the Merricks' enemies, and they're armed for war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're not interested in surrender. But Michael isn't the white flag type anyway. Everything is set for the final showdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four elements, one family. Will they hold together, or be torn apart?</description>

  <description>EARTH. FIRE. AIR. WATER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Merrick is stretched to breaking point. He's trying to keep his grades sky-high or he won't get in to college. He's trying to keep his brother's business afloat or the Merricks will be out on the street. He's trying to keep the secret of where he's going in the evenings from his twin brother Gabriel - or he fears he'll lose his family. And he's trying to keep his mind off the hot, self-assured dancer who is his 'girlfriend's' partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Quinn takes to hanging around his sworn enemy, and an Elemental Guide is counting the hours until he can try again to kill the Merrick brothers. Storms are brewing. On all sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECRETS IN THE WIND. DANGER IN THE AIR.</description>

  <description>With power comes enemies. Lots of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter Garrity just wants to be left alone. He’s learned the hard way that his unusual abilities come at a price. And he can’t seem to afford any allies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s up to his neck in hostiles. His grandfather, spoiling for a fight. The Merrick brothers, who think he ratted them out. Calla, the scheming psycho who wants to use him as bait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there’s Kate Sullivan, the new girl at school. She’s not hostile. She’s bold. Funny. Hot. But she’s got an agenda, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With supposedly secret powers rippling to the surface everywhere around him, Hunter knows something ugly is about to go down. But finding out what means he’ll have to find someone he can trust…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Too many secrets. Not enough time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Merrick is supposed to be the level-headed one. The peacemaker. Since it’s just him and his three hotheaded brothers against the world, that’s a survival tactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now he’s got problems even his brothers can’t help him survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His so-called girlfriend, Quinn, is going quick as mercury from daring to crazy. Meanwhile, Quinn’s dancer friend Adam is throwing Nick off balance, forcing him to recognize a truth he’d rather shove back into the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He can feel it—the atmosphere is sizzling. Danger is on the way. But whatever happens next, Nick is starting to find out that sometimes nothing you do can keep the peace.</description>

  <description>Gabriel Merrick plays with fire. Literally. Sometimes he can even control it. And sometimes he can't. Gabriel has always had his brothers to rely on, especially his twin, Nick. But when an arsonist starts wreaking havoc on their town, all the signs point to Gabriel. Only he's not doing it. And no one seems to believe him.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Being a force of nature doesn't keep you safe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter Garrity is used to watching his back. The kids at school sense something different about him. And they're right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter has powers that have nothing to do with how hard he can throw a punch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that's what Clare Kasten is picking up. She's shy, quiet, and intense, but she's sought him out. There's no telling what she wants from him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Hunter knows enough to sense a secret when it's close. And getting close to Clare is a danger he's ready to face. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Plenty of romance and non-stop action. . ..Elemental is the new series to watch." --Inara Scott, author of &lt;i&gt;The Marked&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Brigid Kemmerer and The Elemental Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Magic, suspense, and enough twists to keep you reading until sunrise. An incredible start to the series!" --Award winning author Erica O'Rourke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Overflowing with action, snappy dialog, and hot guys--The Elemental Series will take your breath away." --Kim Harrington, author of &lt;i&gt;Clarity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brigid Kemmerer&lt;/b&gt; finds time to write between her family and her day job, but sometimes she ends up mothering her coworkers and managing her family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11,000 Words</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Earth, Fire, Air, Water – they have more power than you dream.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her ex-boyfriend spread those lies about her, Becca Chandler is suddenly getting all the guys—all the ones she &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; want. Then she saves Chris Merrick from a beating in the school parking lot. Chris is different. &lt;i&gt;Way&lt;/i&gt; different: he can control water—just like his brothers can control fire, wind, and earth. They’re powerful. Dangerous. Marked for death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that she knows the truth, so is Becca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets are hard to keep when your life’s at stake. When Hunter, the mysterious new kid around school, turns up with a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, Becca thinks she can trust him. But then Hunter goes head-to-head with Chris, and Becca wonders who’s hiding the most dangerous truth of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The storm is coming . . .&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From two students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School comes a declaration for our times, and an in-depth look at the making of the #NeverAgain movement that arose after the Parkland, Florida, shooting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 14, 2018, seventeen-year-old David Hogg and his fourteen-year-old sister, Lauren, went to school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, like any normal Wednesday. That day, of course, the world changed. By the next morning, with seventeen classmates and faculty dead, they had joined the leadership of a movement to save their own lives, and the lives of all other young people in America. It's a leadership position they did not seek, and did not want--but events gave them no choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after the massacre, David Hogg told CNN: "We're children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together. Get over your politics and get something done."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America--with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed. With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve. Born just after Columbine and raised amid seemingly endless war and routine active shooter drills, this generation now says, &lt;i&gt;Enough&lt;/i&gt;. This book is their statement of purpose, and the story of their lives. It is the essential guide to the #NeverAgain movement.</description>

  <description>Twins Crystal and Amber have the same goal: to be the first in their family to graduate high school and make something of their lives. When one gets pregnant during their junior year, they promise to raise the baby together. It’s not easy, but between their after-school jobs, they’re scraping by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal’s grades catch the attention of the new guidance counselor, who tells her about a college that offers a degree in automotive restoration, perfect for the car buff she is. When she secretly applies—and gets in—new opportunities threaten their once-certain plans, and Crystal must make a choice: follow her dreams or stay behind and honor the promise she made to her sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminist readers in particular will appreciate this strong young woman who doesn’t conform to gender norms.. -Kirkus</description>

  <description>For Angel Rahimi, life is only about one thing: The Ark – a pop-rock trio of teenage boys who are currently taking the world by storm. Being part of The Ark’s fandom has given her everything – her friendships, her dreams, her place in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Kaga-Ricci owes everything to The Ark too. He’s their frontman – and playing in a band is all he’s ever dreamed of doing. It’s just a shame that recently everything in his life seems to have turned into a bit of a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that’s the problem with dreaming – eventually, inevitably, real life arrives with a wake-up call. And when Angel and Jimmy are unexpectedly thrust together, they will discover just how strange and surprising facing up to reality can be.</description>

  <description>Mailee and Cara take care of each other. Mailee is the star of the high school plays; Cara is the stage manager. Mailee can't keep her life together; Cara has enough organizational skills for the both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the girls are invited to visit the Haven, a commune in the mountains near their suburban Montana homes, it seems like an adventure. Until Cara starts spending every waking minute there ... and Mailee thinks it's creepy, almost like a cult. When Cara decides she's going to move to the Haven permanently, Mailee knows it's a bad idea. But how far will she go to save her best friend ... from herself?</description>

  <description>Mila Flores and her best friend Riley have always been inseparable. There's not much excitement in their small town of Cross Creek, so Mila and Riley make their own fun, devoting most of their time to Riley's favorite activity: amateur witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Riley and two Fairmont Academy mean girls die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Riley, June, and Dayton have no recollection of their murders, but they do have unfinished business to attend to. Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a "parallel universe" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl, Interrupted is a clear-sighted, unflinching documnet that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and recovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fourteen years ago, a three-year-old girl was the only survivor at a horrific murder scene. Now she’s determined to search for the truth—and the killer is even more determined to stop her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olivia’s mother was murdered and her father disappeared, everyone suspected her father had done it. Fast-forward fourteen years. New evidence now proves Olivia’s father was actually murdered on the same fateful day her mother died. That means there’s a killer still at large. Can Olivia uncover the truth before the killer tracks her down?</description>

  <description>Linden Rose has a big secret--she is homeless and living in the halls of her small-town high school. Her position as school blog editor, her best friends, Ham and Seung, and the promise of a future far away are what keep Linden under the radar and moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when cool-girl Bea comes to school with a bloody lip, the damage hits too close to home. Linden begins looking at Bea's life, and soon her investigation prompts people to pay more attention. And attention is the last thing she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linden knows the only way to put a stop to the violence is to tell Bea's story and come to terms with her own painful past. Even if that means breaking her rules for survival and jeopardizing the secrets she's worked so hard to keep.</description>

  <description>The star of the hit show Glee shares her experiences and insider tips on beauty, fashion, inner strength, and more in an illustrated book that’s part memoir, part how-to, and part style guide.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lea Michele is one of the hardest working performers in show business. Whether she’s starring as Rachel Berry on Glee, rocking a glamorous look on the red carpet, recording her solo album, or acting as the spokesperson for L’Oreal, Lea is the ultimate multi-tasker. She knows better than anyone that it is difficult to be your best self and keep things in perspective when your to-do list is overflowing and you are faced with challenges, so she’s developed a foolproof system for remaining healthy and centered. In Brunette Ambition, she reveals the lessons and advice that have worked for her--from beauty and fashion secrets to fitness tips, and career insights. Supplemented with never-before-seen photos and revealing anecdotes, it’s the book Lea wishes she’d had in her teens and early twenties: A practical and inspirational guide to harnessing tenacity and passion and living the fullest life, no matter what obstacles life puts in your way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Chelsea Clinton introduces tiny feminists, mini activists and little kids who are ready to take on the world to thirteen inspirational women who never took no for an answer, and who always, inevitably and without fail, persisted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout American history, there have always been women who have spoken out for what’s right, even when they have to fight to be heard. In early 2017, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to be silenced in the Senate inspired a spontaneous celebration of women who persevered in the face of adversity. In this book, Chelsea Clinton celebrates thirteen American women who helped shape our country through their tenacity, sometimes through speaking out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience. They all certainly persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She Persisted&lt;/i&gt; is for everyone who has ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who has ever tried to reach for the stars but was told to sit down, and for everyone who has ever been made to feel unworthy or unimportant or small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With vivid, compelling art by Alexandra Boiger, this book shows readers that no matter what obstacles may be in their paths, they shouldn’t give up on their dreams. Persistence is power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book features: Harriet Tubman, Helen Keller, Clara Lemlich, Nellie Bly, Maria Tallchief, Claudette Colvin, Ruby Bridges, Margaret Chase Smith, Sally Ride, Florence Griffith Joyner, Oprah Winfrey, Sonia Sotomayor—and one special cameo.</description>

  <description>The witch: supernaturally powerful, inscrutably independent, and now—indestructible. These moving, relatable poems encourage resilience and embolden women to take control of their own stories. Enemies try to judge, oppress, and marginalize her, but the witch doesn’t burn in this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never fall for your best friend…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushing thirty, with his reenlistment looming, decorated navy sniper Maddox Horvat is taking a long look at what he really wants in life. And what he wants is Ben Tovey. It isn’t smart, falling for his best friend and fellow SEAL, but ten years with Ben has forged a bond so intimate Maddox can’t ignore it. He needs Ben by his side forever—heart and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben admits he likes what he’s seen—his friend’s full lower lip and the perfect muscles of his ass have proved distracting more than once. But Ben's still reeling from a relationship gone to hell, and he's not about to screw up his friendship with Maddox, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until their next mission throws Ben and Maddox closer together than ever before, with only each other to depend on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in the lonely, desperate hours awaiting rescue, the real challenge—confronting themselves, their future and their desires—begins. Man to man, friend to friend, lover to lover.</description>

  <description>When Ben De Backer comes out to their parents as nonbinary, they're thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas, whom Ben has never even met. Struggling with an anxiety disorder compounded by their parents' rejection, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their therapist and try to keep a low profile in a new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ben's attempts to survive the last half of senior year unnoticed are thwarted when Nathan Allan, a funny and charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wing. As Ben and Nathan's friendship grows, their feelings for each other begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At turns heartbreaking and joyous, &lt;i&gt;I Wish You All the Best&lt;/i&gt; is both a celebration of life, friendship, and love, and a shining example of hope in the face of adversity.</description>

To her own surprise, seventeen-year-old Miranda finds the others looking to her as their leader. But she’s hiding a big secret—and she’s not the only one. The group has only three choices—run, hide, or fight back. The wrong decision will have fatal consequences.</description>

  <description>Jasmine and Chelsea are sick of the way women are treated even at their progressive NYC high school, so they decide to start a Women's Rights Club. They post everything online—poems, essays, videos of Chelsea performing her poetry, and Jasmine's response to the racial macroaggressions she experiences—and soon they go viral. But with such positive support, the club is also targeted by online trolls. When things escalate, the principal shuts the club down. Jasmine and Chelsea will risk everything for their voices—and those of other young women—to be heard.</description>

  <description>The Girls of Innovations Academy are beautiful and well-behaved—it says so on their report cards. Under the watchful gaze of their Guardians, the all-girl boarding school offers an array of studies and activities, from “Growing a Beautiful and Prosperous Garden” to “Art Appreciation” and “Interior Design.” The girls learn to be the best society has to offer. Absent is the difficult math coursework, or the unnecessary sciences or current events. They are obedient young ladies, free from arrogance or defiance. Until Mena starts to realize that their carefully controlled existence may not be quite as it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mena and her friends begin to uncover the dark secrets of what’s actually happening there—and who they really are—the girls of Innovations will find out what they are truly capable of. Because some of the prettiest flowers have the sharpest thorns.</description>

  <description>Hannah's a witch, but not the kind you're thinking of. She's the real deal, an Elemental with the power to control fire, earth, water, and air. But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (read: non-witch), she could lose it. For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dealing with her ex is the least of Hannah's concerns when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire. Evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, and Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. The issue is, her coven is less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the pair attempt to smoke out the Blood Witch at a house party, Hannah meets Morgan, a cute new ballerina in town. But trying to date amid a supernatural crisis is easier said than done, and Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven and get the girl, especially when the attacks on Salem's witches become deadlier by the day.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

  <description>A hilarious story of a diverse group of young sleuths who band together to solve a murder mystery while at a weight-loss camp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in the Oregon wilderness sits Camp Bloom, a weight-loss camp where "overweight" teens can "get in shape." Jesse would rather be anywhere else, but her parents are forcing her to go. Noah isn't sure if he wants to be there, but it's too late to turn back. Tony is heartbroken at the thought of giving up his phone and internet. And Kate...well, she likes the hikes, at least. As far as these four teens are concerned, it's just another boring summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until one night, when Jesse and Noah witness a beloved counselor's murder. The body's gone by the next morning, but a blurry photo leads to one clue—the murderer is one of the camp's staff members!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But which one? As Jesse, Noah, Kate, and Tony investigate, they quickly discover that everyone's got their secrets...and one of them would kill to keep theirs hidden.</description>

  <description>We were so young when it all happened--just 13-year-olds making the most of the long, hot, lazy days of summer, thinking we had the world at our feet. That was us--me, Fat Bobby, Jim, and Tara--the four members of the Outsiders’ Club. The day we found a burnt-out car in the woods was the day everything changed. Cold, hard cash in the front seat and a body in the trunk. It started as a mystery we were desperate to solve. Then the Collector arrived. He knew we had found his secret, and suddenly, our summer of innocence turned into the stuff of nightmares.</description>

  <description>A coming-of-age middle-grade graphic novel about summer and friendships, written and illustrated by the Eisner Award–winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling Hope Larson.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Bina has a long summer ahead of her. She and her best friend, Austin, usually do everything together, but he's off to soccer camp for a month, and he's been acting kind of weird lately anyway. So it's up to Bina to see how much fun she can have on her own. At first it's a lot of guitar playing, boredom, and bad TV, but things look up when she finds an unlikely companion in Austin's older sister, who enjoys music just as much as Bina. But then Austin comes home from camp, and he's acting even weirder than when he left. How Bina and Austin rise above their growing pains and reestablish their friendship and respect for their differences makes for a touching and funny coming-of-age story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A good friend will bury your body, a best friend will dig you back up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dino doesn’t mind spending time with the dead. His parents own a funeral home, and death is literally the family business. He’s just not used to them talking back. Until Dino’s ex-best friend July dies suddenly—and then comes back to life. Except not exactly. Somehow July is not quite alive, and not quite dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dino and July attempt to figure out what’s happening, they must also confront why and how their friendship ended so badly, and what they have left to understand about themselves, each other, and all those grand mysteries of life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>Harry Ackerson has always considered his step-mother Alice to be sexy and beautiful, in an “other worldly” way. She has always been kind and attentive, if a little aloof in the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days before his college graduation, Alice calls with shocking news. His father is dead and the police think it’s suicide. Devastated, he returns to his father’s home in Maine. There, he and Alice will help one another pick up of the pieces of their lives and uncover what happened to his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after he arrives, Harry meets a mysterious young woman named Grace McGowan. Though she claims to be new to the area, Harry begins to suspect that Grace may not be a complete stranger to his family. But she isn’t the only attractive woman taking an interest in Harry. The sensual Alice is also growing closer, coming on to him in an enticing, clearly sexual way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mesmerized by these two women, Harry finds himself falling deeper under their spell. Yet the closer he gets to them, the more isolated he feels, disoriented by a growing fear that both women are hiding dangerous—even deadly—secrets . . . and that neither one is telling the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A timely and captivating memoir about gender identity set against the backdrop of the transgender equality movement, by a leading activist and the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarah McBride is on a mission to fight for transgender rights around the world. But before she was a prominent activist, and before she became the first transgender person to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, she was a teenager struggling with her identity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With emotional depth and unparalleled honesty, Sarah shares her personal struggle with gender identity, coming out to her supportive but distraught parents, and finding her way as a woman. She inspires readers with her barrier-breaking political journey that took her, in just four years, from a frightened, closeted college student to one of the nation's most prominent transgender activists walking the halls of the White House, passing laws, and addressing the country in the midst of a heated presidential election. She also details the heartbreaking romance with her first love and future husband Andy, a trans man and activist, who passed away from cancer in 2014 just days after they were married.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarah's story of identity, love, and tragic loss serves as a powerful entry point for readers who want to gain a deeper understanding of gender identity and what it means to be openly transgender. From issues like bathroom access to healthcare, identification and schools, Sarah weaves the important political milestones, cultural and political debates, and historical context into a personal journey that will open hearts and change minds.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tomorrow Will Be Different&lt;/i&gt; highlights Sarah’s work as an activist and the key issues at the forefront of the fight for trans equality, providing a call-to-arms and empowering look at the road ahead. The fight for equality and freedom has only just begun.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“We must never be a country that says there’s only one way to love, only one way to look, and only one way to live.” –Sarah McBride</description>

  <description>As a successful social media journalist with half a million followers, seventeen-year-old Cal is used to sharing his life online. But when his pilot father is selected for a highly publicized NASA mission to Mars, Cal and his family relocate from Brooklyn to Houston and are thrust into a media circus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the chaos, Cal meets sensitive and mysterious Leon, another “Astrokid,” and finds himself falling head over heels—fast. As the frenzy around the mission grows, so does their connection. But when secrets about the program are uncovered, Cal must find a way to reveal the truth without hurting the people who have become most important to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expertly capturing the thrill of first love and the self-doubt all teens feel, debut author Phil Stamper is a new talent to watch.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

  <description>In downtown Chicago, Esther Vaughan disappears from her apartment without a trace. A haunting letter addressed to My Dearest is found among her possessions, leaving her roommate Quinn Collins to question how well she really knew her friend. Meanwhile, in a small town an hour outside Chicago, a mysterious woman appears in the quiet coffee shop where eighteen-year-old Alex Gallo works as a dishwasher. He is immediately drawn to her, but what starts as an innocent crush quickly spirals into something far more sinister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Quinn searches for answers about Esther, and Alex is drawn further under the stranger's spell, master of suspense Mary Kubica takes readers on a taut and twisted thrill ride that builds to a stunning conclusion and shows that no matter how fast and far we run, the past always catches up with us.</description>

  <description>At twenty-three, Poe Montgomery is going nowhere. He still lives in his father’s basement and spends most of his time tagging with his friends. When an arrest lands him in debt, Poe accepts the front desk job at Permanent Ink, the tattoo shop owned by his father’s best friend, Jericho McAslan. Jericho is nearly twice Poe’s age, but with his ink and prematurely graying hair, he quickly takes the starring role in Poe’s hottest fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jericho is known for his ability to transform poorly designed tattoos into works of art, but he was once as aimless and misdirected as Poe. Wanting to pay it forward the way someone once did for him, Jericho makes Poe his apprentice and is determined to keep things strictly professional. Easier said than done when Poe makes his interest—and his daddy kink—abundantly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jericho can’t resist Poe or their intense chemistry for long. But between the age gap, tension with Poe’s father, and Poe’s best friend calling him a sellout, they’ll need to ensure they’re both on the same page before they can rewrite their rocky start into something permanent.</description>

  <description>Tristan Holt is nothing if not pragmatic. Despite a flourishing career as a defenseman for the Atlanta Venom, Tristan knows he can’t play hockey forever. One day he’ll retire—if an injury doesn’t force him to hang up his skates first. His backup plan? Finishing his business degree. But he doesn’t count on a very inappropriate attraction to his standoffish sociology professor, Sebastian Cruz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is on the bottom rung of the Sociology Department at Georgia State. He has his sights set on tenure, and he can’t afford to be distracted, especially not by a sexy student with a body straight out of Sebastian’s dreams. No matter how much Tristan tempts him, that’s one line Sebastian won’t cross. At least not until summer classes end. After that, everything is fair game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sebastian lives loud and proud, and Tristan is terrified of being the first out player in the NHL. Neither of them can afford to risk their hearts when they can’t imagine a happily ever after. The problem is, unlike hockey, when it comes to love, there are no rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They said she had evil eyes...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyes that saw what was not meant to be seen. Kaitlyn Fairchild was frightened by her uncanny talent, by the prophetic drawings that isolated her at school. Until she was invited to California, to attend the Zetes institute with four other psychically gifted students, in return for a college scholarship. It was a chance to begin again, to belong; a great adventure, with the promise of romance...with Rob, irresistible, yet strangely innocent...with dark, enigmatic Gabriel. Until they learn the truth about an experiment that threatens their sanity, and their lives. All they have is each other, and a perilous psychic link that can save - or destroy - them all...</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>From one of the fiercest critics writing today, Morgan Jerkins’ highly-anticipated collection of linked essays interweaves her incisive commentary on pop culture, feminism, black history, misogyny, and racism with her own experiences to confront the very real challenges of being a black woman today—perfect for fans of Roxane Gay’s &lt;i&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/i&gt;, Rebecca Solnit’s &lt;i&gt;Men Explain Things to Me&lt;/i&gt;, and Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie’s &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan Jerkins is only in her twenties, but she has already established herself as an insightful, brutally honest writer who isn’t afraid of tackling tough, controversial subjects. In &lt;i&gt;This Will Be My Undoing&lt;/i&gt;, she takes on perhaps one of the most provocative contemporary topics: What does it mean to “be”—to live as, to exist as—a black woman today? This is a book about black women, but it’s necessary reading for all Americans.</description>

  <description>From the award-winning, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fireman is coming. Stay cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When I was wild, you were steady . . . &lt;br /&gt;Now you are wild - what am I? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden McKinley knows she can’t count on much in this world, but she can depend on Bonnie, her solid, steady, straight-A best friend. So it’s a complete shock when, five days before the start of their GCSEs, Bonnie runs away with a guy Eden knows nothing about. And it's the last person she would ever have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the days pass, and her world begins to unravel, Eden is forced to question everything she thought she knew about her best friend and herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Borb&lt;/i&gt; by Jason Little (&lt;i&gt;Shutterbug Follies&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Motel Art Improvement Service&lt;/i&gt;) is the story of Borb, a severely alcoholic homeless man. Borb is a downtrodden urban Candide whose misfortunes pile up at an alarming rate. The narrative is presented as a series of daily newspaper strips as the author draws on the long and complex tradition of the comic strip slapstick vagabond archetype. At once hilarious, horrifying, and full or heart, &lt;i&gt;Borb&lt;/i&gt; depicts the real horrors specific to present-day urban homelessness. &lt;i&gt;Borb&lt;/i&gt; is Little's most complex and challenging work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason Little&lt;/b&gt; studied photography at Oberlin College, and now resides in Brooklyn with writer Myla Goldberg and their daughter Zelie Goldberg-Little. He has been drawing cartoons since he was a child. In addition to acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Shutterbug Follies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Motel Art Improvement Service&lt;/i&gt;, he also created the Xeric Award–winning &lt;i&gt;Jack's Luck Runs Out&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a number of short works for various cartoon anthologies.</description>

  <description>It's been three years since the Virgil County High School Massacre. Three years since my best friend, Sarah, was killed in a bathroom stall during the mass shooting. Everyone knows Sarah's story--that she died proclaiming her faith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's not true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know because I was with her when she died. I didn't say anything then, and people got hurt because of it. Now Sarah's parents are publishing a book about her, so this might be my last chance to set the record straight . . . but I'm not the only survivor with a story to tell about what did--and didn't--happen that day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Sarah's martyrdom is important to a lot of people, people who don't take kindly to what I'm trying to do. And the more I learn, the less certain I am about what's right. I don't know what will be worse: the guilt of staying silent or the consequences of speaking up . . .</description>

      <![CDATA[3 stars.<br /><br />This was a pretty well done audiobook and I actually really loved Keplinger's writing, but the story got a bit too long and if I'm honest, the main secret the main character was trying to expose didn't seem to be as big of a deal as the book was trying to make it out to be.]]>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars. <br /><br />The first half of this book was not thrilling at all, but I really started to enjoy it once it picked up. <br /><br />I thought the characters were decently rounded, even if they're stupid. <br /><br />The ending kiiiinda shook me. That's all I'll say.]]>

  <description>A cyberstalked high-school advice columnist takes matters into her own hands to discover the secrets behind her twin sister's murder in this intense and compelling mystery thriller.&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Clara Seibert ghostwrites an advice column for her school’s newspaper. She’s funny, feisty, and cares deeply about making a difference in people’s lives, but her own personal problems threaten to overwhelm her. Five months ago, her twin, Moura, was murdered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon threatening emails start to arrive at her staff inbox. Convinced that her email stalker blames Clara for her sister’s death and is out for revenge, she decides to undertake her own investigation. Can she solve the murder in time to save herself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This suspenseful page-turner about a complicated sibling relationship is perfect for fans of We Were Liars, Fangirl, I'll Give You the Sun, and Vanishing Girls. Secrets, lies, brilliantly crafted twists and turns, and a dual mystery will keep readers in suspense until the very last page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although primarily a whodunit, this novel also focuses on important social themes high-school teens face. Lynn blends a page-turning mystery thriller with sweet romance and demonstrates the very real effects of grief, rivalry, sexuality, dating violence, and bullying on today's youth. Clara is believable, relatable, smart, snarky, brave, and conscientious. Her strong teen voice will resonate with a wide audience, and she is a perfect role model for teens who are dealing with similar social issues.</description>

  <description>Vee Bell is certain of one irrefutable truth - her sister's friend Sophie didn't kill herself. She was murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vee knows this because she was &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;. Everyone believes Vee is narcoleptic, but she doesn't actually fall asleep during these episodes: When she passes out, she slides into somebody else's mind and experiences the world through that person's eyes. She's slid into her sister as she cheated on a math test, into a teacher sneaking a drink before class. She learned the worst about a supposed "friend" when she slid into her during a school dance. But nothing could have prepared Vee for what happens one October night when she slides into the mind of someone holding a bloody knife, standing over Sophie's slashed body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vee desperately wishes she could share her secret, but who would believe her? It sounds so crazy that she can't bring herself to tell her best friend, Rollins, let alone the police. Even if she could confide in Rollins, he has been acting distant lately, especially now that she's been spending more time with Zane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enmeshed in a terrifying web of secrets, lies, and danger and with no one to turn to, Vee must find a way to unmask the killer before he or she strikes again.</description>

  <description>Kacey is the new girl in Broken Falls. When she moved in with her father, she stepped into a brand-new life. A life with a stepbrother, a stepmother, and strangest of all, an adoring younger half sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacey’s new life is eerily charming compared with the wild highs and lows of the old one she lived with her volatile mother. And everyone is so nice in Broken Falls—she’s even been welcomed into a tight new circle of friends. Bailey and Jade invite her to do everything with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why it’s so odd when they start acting distant. And when they don’t invite her to the biggest party of the year, it doesn’t exactly feel like an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kacey will never be able to ask, because Bailey never makes it home from that party. Suddenly, Broken Falls doesn’t seem so welcoming after all—especially once everyone starts looking to the new girl for answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacey is about to learn some very important lessons: Sometimes appearances can be deceiving. Sometimes when you’re the new girl, you shouldn’t trust anyone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Life ahead: Proceed with caution.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Petula De Wilde is anything but wild. A family tragedy has made her shut herself off from the world. Once a crafting fiend with a happy life, Petula now sees danger in everything, from airplanes to ground beef.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The worst part of her week is her comically lame mandatory art therapy class. She has nothing in common with this small band of teenage misfits, except that they all carry their own burden of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jacob joins their ranks, he seems so normal and confident. Petula wants nothing to do with him, or his prosthetic arm. But when they’re forced to collaborate on a unique school project, she slowly opens up, and he inspires her to face her fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a hidden truth threatens to derail everything.</description>

  <description>When She Woke is a fable about a stigmatized woman struggling to navigate an America of a not-too-distant future, who embarks on a path of self-discovery that forces her to question the values she once held true and the righteousness of a country that politicizes faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bellwether Prize Winner Hillary Jordan's provocative new novel is the fiercely imagined story of a woman struggling to navigate an America of a not-too-distant future, where the line between church and state has been eradicated and convicted felons are no longer imprisoned and rehabilitated but chromed - their skin color is genetically altered to match the class of their crime - and then released back into the population to survive as best they can. Hannah is a Red; her crime is murder.</description>

  <description>The Cat in the Hat returns for more out-of-control fun in this wintry Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a snowy day and Dick and Sally are stuck shovelling . . . until the Cat in the Hat arrives to liven things up (to say the least!). Featuring the Cat’s helpers Little Cat A, Little Cat B, and so on through the alphabet, and ending with a gigantic Voom, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The Cat in the Hat Comes Back' is a riotous, fun-filled follow-up to Dr. Seuss’s classic 'The Cat in the Hat.'.</description>

  <description>Poor Sally and her brother. It's cold and wet and they're stuck in the house with nothing to do . . . until a giant cat in a hat shows up, transforming the dull day into a madcap adventure and almost wrecking the place in the process! Written by Dr. Seuss in 1957 in response to the concern that "pallid primers [with] abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls' were leading to growing illiteracy among children, &lt;i&gt;The Cat in the Hat &lt;/i&gt;(the first Random House Beginner Book) changed the way our children learn how to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Details:&lt;/b&gt; 
   Format: Hardcover 
   Publication Date: 3/12/1957

  <description>When Alix's charismatic girlfriend, Swanee, dies from sudden cardiac arrest, Alix is overcome with despair. As she searches Swanee's room for mementos of their relationship, she finds Swanee's cell phone, pinging with dozens of texts sent from a mysterious contact, L.T. The most recent text reads: "Please tell me what I did. Please, Swan. Te amo. I love you."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocked and betrayed, Alix learns that Swanee has been leading a double life--secretly dating a girl named Liana the entire time she's been with Alix. Alix texts Liana from Swanee's phone, pretending to be Swanee in order to gather information before finally meeting face-to-face to break the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought together by Swanee's lies, Alix and Liana become closer than they'd thought possible. But Alix is still hiding the truth from Liana. Alix knows what it feels like to be lied to--but will coming clean to Liana mean losing her, too?</description>

  <description>There are exactly two things that Rafael Torres has always wanted out of life. The first is to see the Golden Gate Bridge in person and experience the sight that inspired his late mother to become a brilliant architect. The second is for his best friend, Henry Wyatt, to finally reciprocate the love that Rafael has held for him for over a decade. For a moment, it seems as if Rafael might get everything he’s hoped for when Henry joins him on a trip to finally visit the Golden Gate Bridge. But all is not as it seems, and Rafael will be forced to confront his complicated history with Henry while learning that in the end, life is never exactly as we want it to be, and we all die trying to get it right.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adelina Amouteru’s heart has suffered at the hands of both family and friends, turning her down the bitter path of revenge. Now known and feared as the White Wolf, she flees Kenettra with her sister to find other Young Elites in the hopes of building her own army of allies. Her goal: to strike down the Inquisition Axis, the white-cloaked soldiers who nearly killed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Adelina is no heroine. Her powers, fed only by fear and hate, have started to grow beyond her control. She does not trust her newfound Elite friends. Teren Santoro, leader of the Inquisition, wants her dead. And her former friends, Raffaele and the Dagger Society, want to stop her thirst for vengeance. Adelina struggles to cling to the good within her. But how can someone be good when her very existence depends on darkness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Marie Lu delivers another heart-pounding adventure in this exhilarating sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Young Elites&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Who’s Crazy?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What does it mean to be crazy? Is using the word crazy offensive? What happens when such a label gets attached to your everyday experiences?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In order to understand mental health, we need to talk openly about it. Because there’s no single definition of crazy, there’s no single experience that embodies it, and the word itself means different things—wild? extreme? disturbed? passionate?—to different people.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Don’t) Call Me Crazy&lt;/i&gt; is a conversation starter and guide to better understanding how our mental health affects us every day. Thirty-three writers, athletes, and artists offer essays, lists, comics, and illustrations that explore their personal experiences with mental illness, how we do and do not talk about mental health, help for better understanding how every person’s brain is wired differently, and what, exactly, might make someone crazy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever struggled with your mental health, or know someone who has, come on in, turn the pages, and let’s get talking.</description>

  <description>Prestigious. Powerful. Privileged. This is Fullbrook Academy, an elite prep school where history looms in the leafy branches over its brick walkways. But some traditions upheld in its hallowed halls are profoundly dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jules Devereux just wants to keep her head down, avoid distractions, and get into the right college, so she can leave Fullbrook and its old-boy social codes behind. She wants freedom, but ex-boyfriends and ex-best friends are determined to keep her in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Baxter feels like an imposter at Fullbrook, but the hockey scholarship that got him in has given him a chance to escape his past and fulfill the dreams of his parents and coaches, whose mantra rings in his ears: &lt;i&gt;Don’t disappoint us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jamie and Jules meet, they recognize in each other a similar instinct for survival, but at a school where girls in the student handbook are rated by their looks, athletes stack hockey pucks in dorm room windows like notches on a bedpost, and school-sponsored dances push first year girls out into the night with senior boys, the stakes for safe sex, real love, and true friendship couldn’t be higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jules and Jamie’s lives intertwine, and the pressures to play by the rules and remain silent about the school’s secrets intensify, they see Fullbrook for what it really is. That &lt;i&gt;tradition&lt;/i&gt;, a word Fullbrook hides behind, can be ugly, even violent. Ultimately, Jules and Jamie are faced with the difficult question: can they stand together against classmates—and an institution—who believe they can do no wrong?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'At 16, I pretended to fall in love with Alyssa.'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet James and Alyssa, two teenagers facing the fears of coming adulthood. As their story is told through chapters which alternate each character's perspective, however, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn. With James's character becoming rapidly more sociopathic, they are forced to take a road trip that owes as much to &lt;i&gt;Badlands&lt;/i&gt; as &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;, and which threatens both their futures forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most talked about graphic novels of recent years, &lt;i&gt;The End of The Fucking World&lt;/i&gt; marks Charles Forsman's UK debut.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone... except the villains they once overthrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.</description>

  <description>The fifth grade. The threshold to puberty, and the beginning of the end of childhood innocence. Shuichi Nitori and his new friend Yoshino Takatsuki have happy homes, loving families, and are well-liked by their classmates. But they share a secret that further complicates a time of life that is awkward for anyone: Shuichi is a boy who wants to be a girl, and Yoshino is a girl who wants to be a boy.&lt;br /&gt; Written and drawn by one of today's most critically acclaimed creators of manga, Shimura portrays Shuishi and Yoshino's very private journey with affection, sensitivity, gentle humor, and unmistakable flair and grace. Book One introduces our two protagonists and the friends and family whose lives intersect with their own. Yoshino is rudely reminded of her sex by immature boys whose budding interest in girls takes clumsily cruel forms. Shuichi's secret is discovered by Saori, a perceptive and eccentric classmate. And it is Saori who suggests that the fifth graders put on a production of &lt;i&gt;The Rose of Versailles&lt;/i&gt; for the farewell ceremony for the sixth graders, with boys playing the roles of women, and girls playing the roles of men. &lt;i&gt;Wandering Son&lt;/i&gt; is a sophisticated work of literary manga translated with rare skill and sensitivity by veteran translator and comics scholar Matt Thorn.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink is my favorite color. I used to say my favorite color was black to be &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, but it is pink—all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink. I read &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m not doing it ironically, though it might seem that way. I once live-tweeted the September issue.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these funny and insightful essays, Roxane Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman of color while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years and commenting on the state of feminism today. The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/em&gt; is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not going to rate it as I feel uncomfortable doing so since it's based on a lot of hard times on people's lives, but it was a quick and eyeopening read. <br /><br />Pretty much TW for everything, though.]]>

  <description>Twenty-eight-year-old Maggie Sparkes arrives in New York City to pack up what's left of her best friend's belongings after a suicide that has left everyone stunned. The police have deemed the evidence conclusive: Celine got into bed, downed a bottle of Xanax and a handle of vodka, and never woke up. But when Maggie discovers secrets in the childhood lock box hidden in Celine's apartment, she begins asking questions. Questions about the man Celine fell in love with. The man she never told anyone about, not even Maggie. The man who Celine herself claimed would be her ruin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hunt for answers that will force the police to reopen the case, Maggie uncovers more than she bargained for about Celine's private life -- and inadvertently puts herself on the radar of a killer who will stop at nothing to keep his crimes undiscovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The "USA TODAY" bestselling author of the Ten Tiny Breaths and Burying Water series makes her suspense debut with this sexy, heartpounding story of a young woman determined to find justice after her best friend's death, a story pulsing with the "intense, hot, emotional" (Colleen Hoover) writing that exhilarates her legions of fans. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

I wasn't really invested until the end, but I'm not rating it very low because one of the side characters, as well as the twists saved this for me, honestly. <br /><br />It wasn't terrible, I just don...]]>
