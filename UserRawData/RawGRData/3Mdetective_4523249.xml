  <description>“This is a random universe,” Reacher says. “Once in a blue moon things turn out just right.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t one of those times.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reacher is on a Greyhound bus, minding his own business, with no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. Then he steps off the bus to help an old man who is obviously just a victim waiting to happen. But you know what they say about good deeds. Now Reacher wants to make it right.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An elderly couple have made a few well-meaning mistakes, and now they owe big money to some very bad people. One brazen move leads to another, and suddenly Reacher finds himself a wanted man in the middle of a brutal turf war between rival Ukrainian and Albanian gangs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reacher has to stay one step ahead of the loan sharks, the thugs, and the assassins. He teams up with a fed-up waitress who knows a little more than she’s letting on, and sets out to take down the powerful and make the greedy pay. It’s a long shot. The odds are against him. But Reacher believes in a certain kind of justice . . . the kind that comes along once in a blue moon.</description>

      <![CDATA[Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is suffering the fate of too many long-running series. It's becoming predictable. Of course, that may be exactly what Reacher's fans want. In this installment, Reacher wars against the Albanian and Ukrainian mobs in an unnamed American city, to right wrongs done to...]]>

  <description>The victim was buried alive in the Georgia woods–then killed in a horrifying fashion. When Sara Linton and Jeffrey Tolliver stumble upon the body, both become consumed with finding out who killed the pretty young woman.

  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;For as Jeffrey and Sara move further down a trail of shocking surprises and hidden passions, neither is prepared for the most stunning discovery of all: the identity of a killer who is more evil and dangerous than anyone could have guessed.</description>

      <![CDATA[Faithless is the penultimate book in Karin Slaughter's Grant County series. When I began this series, I really wanted to like it, but each successive installment keeps hitting me as meh. Slaughter is a superb writer--her plotting, pacing, scene construction and word choice are all very good. She...]]>

  <description>When two young sisters disappear from a strip mall parking lot in a small Pennsylvania town, their devastated mother hires an enigmatic bounty hunter, Alice Vega, to help find the girls. Immediately shut out by a local police department already stretched thin by budget cuts and the growing OxyContin and meth epidemic, Vega enlists the help of a disgraced former cop, Max Caplan. Cap is a man trying to put the scandal of his past behind him and move on, but Vega needs his help to find the girls, and she will not be denied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With little to go on, Vega and Cap will go to extraordinary lengths to untangle a dangerous web of lies, false leads, and complex relationships to find the girls before time runs out, and they are gone forever.</description>

  <description>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman’s Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other’s company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It’s a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.</description>

  <description>In 1919, Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge remains haunted by World War I, where he was forced to have a soldier executed for refusing to fight. When Rutledge is assigned to investigate a murder involving the military, his emotional war wounds flare. It is a case that strikes dangerously close to home--one that will test Rutledge's precarious grip on his own sanity. A "Publishers Weekly" Best Book selection. Martin's Press.</description>

  <description>Eleanor Trewynn is a widow of some years living in Port Mabyn, a small fishing village in Cornwall, England. In her younger days, she traveled the exotic parts of the world with her husband. These days, she’s retired and founded the local charity shop. Her niece, Megan Pencarrow, transferred nearby, and was recently promoted to the rank of Detective Sargent. Perhaps the only downside is that she is now working for a DI who doesn’t approve of women on the police force and who really doesn’t much approve of Megan’s aunt Eleanor, as she is something of a thorn in his rather substantial side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these factors collide when, the day after collecting donations, Eleanor and the vicar’s wife find the dead body of a longhaired, scruffy-looking youth hidden in the stockroom of the charity shop. Then they discover that some donated jewelry thought to be fake is actually very real, very expensive, and the haul from a violent robbery in London. Making matters more complex, the corpse found in the storeroom is apparently not one of the robbers. Carola Dunn's &lt;i&gt;Manna from Hades &lt;/i&gt;is a confounding Cornish case of daring theft, doublecross, and a wily older woman confronted by a case of murder most foul.</description>

      <![CDATA[At its heart, Manna from Hades is a story about daily life in a Cornish village and, oh yes, there just happens to be a murder involved. This traditional cozy is more a police procedural than a mystery, and true to its genre, is heavy on character and setting. The author does have to hide the clu...]]>

  <description>Depression, self-loathing, unemployment, and destroyed relationships: the effects of drug and alcohol addiction run so much deeper than the morning-after hangover. However, awareness alone will not save the struggling addict, as J.P. Willson reveals in his fearless examination of substance dependency; recovery means doing the mental and emotional work to look inside oneself and discover a way to live as a sober, fulfilled individual in an often challenging world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the Mind's Eye: A Journey of Self-Discovery is a thought-provoking and honest examination of the emotional, psychological, and physical ways someone must enact their own healing. As a recovering alcoholic, Willson courageously shares his own story of addiction, as well the ups and downs he experienced along the road to recovery. Packed with astonishing insights about our culture's relationship to alcohol, as well as the lies we tell ourselves in order to keep using, this book will change the way you view addiction. Willson has no qualms about telling the reader how difficult recovery is-and how there is no quick cure-all-but his compassionate, candid reflections help foster the knowledge and will to change....</description>

      <![CDATA[Through the Mind's Eye: A Journey of Self-Discovery is one man's experience with alcoholism and recovery. It reads very much like many of the stories in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous and is valuable in that sense - the Big Book includes many stories, because it's never certain which one th...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Cormac Jacobs was born to lead…&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moving the pack and building a new life for them is proving harder than expected for the mysterious Alpha of the Midnight wolves. Life has rapidly become a case of survival of the fittest between them and the Hunters who threaten their safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a life inside the Hunter Sect, the female he captured is confused and conflicted about the Alpha’s motives. But Cormac needs answers and gaining her trust will take time and patience he doesn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midnight Pack’s future is in peril as blood is shed and lives are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Is this the end for the Midnight Pack, or will their Alpha be able to protect his own?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>Her body is broken. Wrapped in plastic. Dumped on the side of the road. She is the first. There will be more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serial killer thriller that "refuses to let go until you've read the last sentence."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent body was discovered in the grease dumpster behind a Burger King. Dismembered. Shoved into two garbage bags and lowered into the murky oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now rookie agent Violet Darger gets the most important assignment of her career. She travels to the Midwest to face a killer unlike anything she's seen. Aggressive. Territorial. Deranged and driven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another mutilated corpse was found next to a roller rink. A third in the gutter in a residential neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bold displays of violence shock the rural community and rattle local law enforcement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who could carry out such brutality? And why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Agent Darger, there's little physical evidence to work with, and the only witnesses prove to be unreliable. The case seems hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she fails, more will die. He will kill again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victims harbor dark secrets. The clues twist and writhe and refuse to keep still. And the killer watches the investigation on the nightly news, gleeful to relive the violence, knowing that he can't be stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A page-turning thriller packed with heart-stopping suspense. Fans of John Sandford, Jeffery Deaver, Karin Slaughter, and Lisa Gardner should get to know Violet Darger.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a Victorian world with steampunk sensibilities, the adventures and misadventures of inventors, domestics, explorers, and aristocrats intermingle with sometimes humorous, but always amorous, results.&lt;/b&gt; From merely steamy, to highly erotic, to downright graphic, the engaging characters of these 14 interrelated stories find paths to satisfaction in a world replete with bustles, cogs, top hats, and train whistles. Get ready for action, for these stories are &lt;i&gt;Steam Geared!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

There's something in the books that keeps me reading and I want to like them, but I just haven't gotten the rush that I get from a book that I really like.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29076467-the-bone-wall" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue light ripples and crackles as the shield walls fracture. The remnants of a doomed civilization stand vigil outside, intent on plunder and slaves, desirous of untainted blood to strengthen their broken lives. With the poisons, came deformities and powers, enhanced senses and the ability to manipulate waves of energy—lightbenders and fire-wielders. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those who thrived for generations within the walls, the broken world looms, strange and deadly, slowly dying. While the righteous pray for salvation, Rimma prepares for battle, fueled by rage and blinded by vengeance. Her twin, Angel, bound to her by unbreakable magic, seeks light in the darkness, hope in the future, and love in a broken world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;D. Wallace Peach’s fourth novel combines elements of fantasy and science-fiction into a character-driven adventure. The Bone Wall foretells of a dystopian world where a poisoned planet no longer sustains its inhabitants. Who survives when there isn’t enough for all? Who decides? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Bone Wall begins three hundred years in a post-apocalyptic future. Precisely controlled communities with forgotten histories thrive beneath protective energy fields…until those fields begin to fail. What happens when the facades crumble and the past’s dark truth is unearthed? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twins Rimma and Angel share this first person tale of a life unraveling and mending. Both are strong female protagonists who chose opposing paths when thrust in the broken and perilous world. The simplistic lines dividing good and evil blur, and beg the question: Can one survive without the other? What is the secret of their lives that even they can’t comprehend? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If grimdark tales of spiraling destruction and redemption crowd your bookshelf, this fantasy adventure desires a place among them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Bone Wall contains scenes which some readers might find triggering. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

It begins with the male protagonist, Collin Jacobs, making a bet that he can make any girl in his high school prom queen in 30 days. So natural...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The third pulse-pounding novel in the Grant County series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Karin Slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara Linton, medical examiner in the small town of Heartsdale, Georgia, is called out to an apparent suicide on the local college campus. The mutilated body provides little in the way of clues -- and the college authorities are eager to avoid a scandal -- but for Sara and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, things don't add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two more suspicious suicides follow, and a young woman is brutally attacked. For Sara, the violence strikes far too close to home. And as Jeffrey pursues the sadistic killer, he discovers that ex-police detective Lena Adams, now a security guard on campus, may be in possession of crucial information. But, bruised and angered by her expulsion from the force, Lena seems to be barely capable of protecting herself, let alone saving the next victim...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A gripping tour de force of investigative journalism that takes us deep into the investigation behind one of the most frightening and enigmatic serial killers in modern American history, and into the ranks of a singular American police force: the Alaska PD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us have never heard of Israel Keyes. But he is one of the most ambitious, meticulous serial killers of modern time. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as "a force of pure evil", he was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried 'kill kits' - cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools - in remote locations across the country, and over the course of fourteen years, would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years - uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake - many of which remain unsolved to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Predator&lt;/i&gt; is the ambitious culmination of years of on-the-ground interviews with key figures in law enforcement, and in Keyes' life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and the limitations of traditional law enforcement, in one of America's most isolated environments - Alaska - when faced with a killer who defies all expectation and categorization.</description>

  <description>Saturday night dates at the skating rink have been a tradition in the small southern town of Heartsdale for as long as anyone can remember, but when a teenage quarrel explodes into a deadly shoot-out, Sara Linton--the town's pediatrician and medical examiner--finds herself entangled in a terrible tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seemed at first to be a horrific but individual catastrophe proves to have wider implications. The autopsy reveals evidence of long-term abuse, of ritualistic self -mutilation, but when Sara and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver start to investigate, they are frustrated at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The children surrounding the victim close ranks. The families turn their backs. Then a young girl is abducted, and it becomes clear that the first death is linked to an even more brutal crime, one far more shocking than anyone could have imagined. Meanwhile, detective Lena Adams, still recovering from her sister's death and her own brutal attack, finds herself drawn to a young man who might hold the answers. But unless Lena, Sara, and Jeffrey can uncover the deadly secrets the children hide, it's going to happen again . . .</description>

      <![CDATA[Kisscut is the second entry in Karin Slaughter's Grant County series, and it is a gem. New depth is added to familiar characters, the action is taut, and the villains are villainous indeed, their actions disgusting and horrifying. The worst pat is the knowledge that people like that actually exis...]]>

  <description>Old patriarch, Adam Penhallow, yet ruling his family and his Cornish roost with an iron hand from his sickbed. The death of menacing old man, on the eve of his birthday, seems at first to be by natural causes. He was elderly after all. But Penhallow wasn't well liked. Tyrannical Penhallow had ruled over his estate with an iron will and sharp tongue, playing one relative against another. He was so bad tempered and mean that both servants and kin cause to hate him for his cruel and vicious nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soon transpires that far from being a peaceful death, Penhallow was, in fact, murdered, poisoned. And there are more than a dozen prime suspects. With his entire family had assembled for his birthday celebration, and servants that both feared and despised him, there are more than a dozen prime suspects. Every one of them had the ways and means to commit the crime. But which one of them turned hatred into murder? As accusation and suspicion turn in one direction, then another, the claws and backstabbing come out, and no one is exempt from the coming implosion.</description>

      <![CDATA[Penhallow is a tour de force of psychological suspense. It's a crime novel but not a mystery--the reader is privy to all details of the crime and its sad denouement. Its strength lies in Heyer's masterful portrayal of her characters' inner thoughts and emotions. Its conclusion is logical, unexpec...]]>

  <description>A small Georgia town erupts in panic when a young college professor is found brutally mutilated in the local diner. But it's only when town pediatrician and coroner Sara Linton does the autopsy that the full extent of the killer's twisted work becomes clear. Sara's ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, leads the investigation -- a trail of terror that grows increasingly macabre when another local woman is found crucified a few days later. But he's got more than a sadistic serial killer on his hands, for the county's sole female detective, Lena Adams -- the first victim's sister -- wants to serve her own justice. But it is Sara who holds the key to finding the killer. A secret from her past could unmask the brilliantly malevolent psychopath .. or mean her death.</description>

      <![CDATA[Blindsighted is an excellent, thrilling mystery. Slaughter has immense respect for detail in plot, character and setting, and is adept at unexpected plot twists. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that it was fairly obvious who the killer was.]]>

  <description>Winter 1963: two children have disappeared in Manchester; the murderous careers of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady have begun. On a freezing day in December, another child goes missing: 13-year-old Alison Carter vanishes from the isolated Derbyshire hamlet of Scardale. For the young George Bennett it is the beginning of his most difficult and harrowing case: a murder with no body, an investigation with more dead ends and closed faces than he'd have found in the inner city; an outcome that reverberates down the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later he tells his story to journalist Catherine Heathcote, but just when her book is poised for publication, Bennett tries to pull the plug. He has new information that he will not divulge, and that threatens the very foundation of his existence. Catherine is forced to reinvestigate the past, with results that turn the world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A taut psychological thriller that explores, exposes and explodes the border between reality and illusion in a multilayered narrative that turns expectations on their head and reminds us that what we know is what we do not know...</description>

  <description>La giovane Helen ha trovato un nuovo lavoro presso la famiglia Warren, badante e cameriera dell'anziana padrona di casa, costretta a letto da una grave malattia. Ma tutti gli abitanti della casa sembrano posseduti da una specie di ambigua indifferenza, quasi rassegnati a un destino di solitudine e di isolamento. E proprio attorno alla residenza Warren vengono ripetutamente uccise alcune ragazze, tutte impiegate nei dintorni come cameriere. Un serial killer, uno strangolatore, agisce indisturbato, utilizzando, per i suoi delitti, una sciarpa bianca di seta. In una notte di violento temporale, dopo una serie di "strane" coincidenze, vittima di una tremenda macchinazione, Helen rimarrà da sola, faccia a faccia, con il suo assassino. Un vero e proprio classico del brivido da cui fu tratto il mitico (e omonimo) film diretto da Robert Siodmak.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"The work of an author who continues to raise his sights and refine his immense talent."--Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Terrific book. Truly terrific. Tension throughout and tears at the end." &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Sue Grafton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judge Scott Sampson doesn't brag about having a perfect life, but the evidence is clear: A prestigious job. A loving marriage. A pair of healthy children. Then a phone call begins every parent's most chilling nightmare. Scott's six-year-old twins, Sam and Emma, have been taken. The judge must rule exactly as instructed in a drug case he is about to hear. If he refuses, the consequences for the children will be dire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Scott and his wife Alison, the kidnapper's call is only the beginning of a twisting, gut-churning ordeal of blackmail, deceit, and terror. Through it all, they will stop at nothing to get their children back, no matter the cost to themselves . . . or to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Complications and twists build to an unexpected climax that is both perfect and gut-wrenching."--&lt;i&gt;Library Journal, starred review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Grips the reader from the get-go and doesn't let up until the final twist."--Associated Press &lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[A strong entry by popular author. Parks knows how to twist a plot, and hit all those emotional buttons to keep a reader reading. However, some of his rationalizations were weak or uninformed and the book on the whole was about five chapters too long.]]>

  <description>Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, "Death in the Afternoon" is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and "the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick." Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. &lt;p&gt; A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, "Death in the Afternoon" is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt;. Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--"Scout"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/i&gt; perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past--a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, &lt;i&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/i&gt; imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision--a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt;, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to an American classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gripping new translation of the first novel in the famous Inspector Maigret series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What he sought, what he waited and watched out for was the crack in the wall. In other words, the instant when the human being comes out from behind the opponent . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Pietr the Latvian? Is he a gentleman thief? A Russian drinking absinthe in a grimy bar? A married Norwegian sea captain? A twisted corpse in a train bathroom? Or is he all of these men? Inspector Maigret, tracking a mysterious adversary and a trail of bodies, must bide his time before the answer comes into focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book in the brand new Penguin Simenon series featuring brilliant renderings by some of today's best translators from French, &lt;i&gt;Pietr the Latvian&lt;/i&gt; introduces the intrepid Inspector to a new audience.</description>

  <description>Impetuous and headstrong is Tara, Princess of Helium and daughter of John Carter. Tara meets Prince Gahan of Gathol, and is initially unimpressed, viewing him as something of a popinjay. Later she takes her flier into a storm and loses control of the craft, and the storm carries her to an unfamiliar region of Barsoom. After landing and fleeing from a pack of ferocious Banths (Martian lions), she is captured by the horrific Kaldanes, who resemble large heads with small, crab-like legs. The Kaldanes have bred a symbiotic race of headless human-like creatures called Rykors, which they can attach themselves to and ride like a horse. While imprisoned, Tara manages to win over one of the Kaldanes, Ghek, with her lovely singing voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth of his Barsoom series. Burroughs began writing it in January, 1921, and the finished story was first published in Argosy All-Story Weekly as a six-part serial in the issues for February 18 and 25 and March 4, 11, 18 and 25, 1922. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in November 1922. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A daughter," he replied, "only a little younger than Carthoris, and, barring one, the fairest thing that ever breathed the thin air of dying Mars. Only Dejah Thoris, her mother, could be more beautiful than Tara of Helium."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment he fingered the chessmen idly. "We have a game on Mars similar to chess," he said, "very similar. And there is a race there that plays it grimly with men and naked swords. We call the game jetan. It is played on a board like yours, except that there are a hundred squares and we use twenty pieces on each side. I never see it played without thinking of Tara of Helium and what befell her among the chessmen of Barsoom. Would you like to hear her story?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said that I would and so he told it to me, and now I shall try to re-tell it for you as nearly in the words of The Warlord of Mars as I can recall them, but in the third person. If there be inconsistencies and errors, let the blame fall not upon John Carter, but rather upon my faulty memory, where it belongs. It is a strange tale and utterly Barsoomian.</description>

  <description>Mars has become divided by love. Not one, but two princes and a Jeddak are vying for the love of Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is mysteriously kidnapped, treachery threatens to throw Barsoom into bloody war. Now Cathoris must follow in the footsteps of his father, John Carter, and overcome phantom armies, dangerous spies and savage beasts as he attempts to save his true love and reunite Mars. The fourth Martian novel from Burroughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;Upon a massive bench of polished ersite beneath the gorgeous blooms of a giant pimalia a woman sat. Her shapely, sandalled foot tapped impatiently upon the jewel-strewn walk that wound beneath the stately sorapus trees across the scarlet sward of the royal gardens of Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, as a dark-haired, red-skinned warrior bent low toward her, whispering heated words close to her ear. "Ah, Thuvia of Ptarth," he cried, "you are cold even before the fiery blasts of my consuming love! No harder than your heart, nor colder is the hard, cold ersite of this thrice happy bench which supports your divine and fadeless form! Tell me, O Thuvia of Ptarth, that I may still hope-that though you do not love me now, yet some day, some day, my princess, I-" The girl sprang to her feet with an exclamation of surprise and displeasure. Her queenly head was poised haughtily upon her smooth red shoulders. Her dark eyes looked angrily into those of the man.</description>

  <description>A Princess of Mars is the first of eleven thrilling novels that comprise Edgar Rice Burroughs' most exciting saga, known as The Martian Series. It's the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which John Carter, a gentleman from Virginia and a Civil War veteran, unexpectedly finds himself on to the red planet, scene of continuing combat among rival tribes. Captured by a band of six-limbed, green-skinned savage giants called Tharks, Carter soon is accorded all the honor of a chieftain after it's discovered that his muscles, accustomed to Earth's greater gravity, now give him a decided advantage in strength. And when his captors take as prisoner Dejah Thoris, the lovely human-looking princess of the city of Helium, Carter must call upon every ounce of strength, courage, and ingenuity to rescue her-before Dejah becomes the slave of the depraved Thark leader, Tal Hajus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;Her oval face was beautiful in the extreme, her every feature finely chisled and exquisite, her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair, caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure. Similar in face and figure to women of Earth, she was nevertheless a true Martian--and prisoner of the fierce green giants who held me captive, as well!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;To become part of the Nero Wolfe legend, Archie Goodwin must prove his worth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archie Goodwin comes to New York City hoping for a bit of excitement. In his third week working as a night watchman, he stops two burglars in their tracks—with a pair of hot lead slugs. Dismissed from his job for being “trigger-happy,” he parlays his newfound notoriety into a job as a detective’s assistant, helping honest sleuth Del Bascom solve cases like the Morningside Piano Heist, the Rive Gauche Art Gallery Swindle, and the Sumner-Hayes Burglary. But it’s the kidnapping of Tommie Williamson, the son of a New York hotel magnate, that introduces Goodwin to the man who will change his life. Young Tommie has gone missing, and only one detective is built for the job: Nero Wolfe, the heavyset genius of West Thirty-Fifth Street. Together they will form one of the most unlikely crime fighting duos in history—but first Goodwin must find Tommie Williamson, and prove to Wolfe that he deserves a place by his side.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brad Parks delivers another riveting, emotionally powerful stand-alone domestic suspense thriller perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What She Knew&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disaster,&lt;/i&gt; Melanie Barrick was once told, &lt;i&gt;is always closer than you know.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a lesson she learned the hard way growing up in the constant upheaval of foster care. But now that she's survived into adulthood--with a loving husband, a steady job, and a beautiful baby boy named Alex--she thought that turmoil was behind her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one Monday evening when she goes to pick up Alex from childcare only to discover he's been removed by Social Services. And no one will say why. It's a terrifying scenario for any parent, but doubly so for Melanie, who knows the unintended horrors of what everyone coldly calls "the system." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her nightmare mushrooms when she arrives home to learn her house has been raided by sheriff's deputies, who have found enough cocaine to send Melanie to prison for years. The evidence against her is overwhelming, and if Melanie can't prove her innocence, she'll lose Alex forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, assistant commonwealth's attorney Amy Kaye--who has been assigned Melanie's case--has her own troubles. She's been dogged by a cold case no one wants her to pursue: a serial rapist who has avoided detection by wearing a mask and whispering his commands. Over the years, he has victimized dozens of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including Melanie. Yet now her attacker might be the key to her salvation . . . or her undoing.</description>

  <description>A ship's mutiny forces a young noble English couple out onto the African coast, and their child is born in the wild. When they die a short time later, the boy is adopted by an ape, and raised as her own. The boy, Tarzan, rises to dominance in the jungle . . . TARZAN OF THE APES is Edgar Rice Burroughs's exploration of mankind a it's seen from the perspective of a man reared outside civilization, and the insights he offers are often not flattering. Tarzan has all the features we look for in a hero -- he is handsome, brave, and stronger than any ordinary man. But he is an arrogant loner, prone to violence. TARZAN OF THE APES explores that which is within all of us, the primal drives and abilities that made for our survival -- Burroughs created a hero who, because of his immense potential and truly unique upbringing -- became a believable SUPERMAN. Burroughs told the tale in engaging prose which still sweeps us along.</description>

  <description>It is spring, 1996 in a small university town on the east coast of Scotland. Harold Spencer, MD, PhD is in the middle of a bold experiment to cure genetic disease. Opponents say he is going too far and too fast; yet he is driven to end the heartbreak of parents and the early end to so many lives. The breakthrough he has sought is within reach. He and his wife Shelly are also beginning what they call the gala fortnight, celebrating their birthdays and wedding anniversary. &lt;br /&gt;Yet destruction lurks, within the town and within his own lab. &lt;br /&gt;Invivo is a love story. And a story of evil, revenge, and remorse where only the ultimate sacrifice can help keep a promise. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As the crusader era ends, Templar Sergeant Brim Hastings must free his imprisoned brethren by surrendering the heretical scroll that has enabled their two-hundred-year leverage over the Roman Catholic Church. After escaping his order's persecution, and having the role of savior thrust upon him, he and Cypriot apprentice tanner Shayla Kostas discover the boundaries between good evil are not where they'd thought. Seven centuries later, Rick Lambert's investigation into Christian priest abductions in Iraq grows in scope after he's given a cryptic Roman gaming stone. As he learns of the motive for recent Templar preceptory demolitions throughout France, he and his team must prevent religious extremists from shattering Christianity by winning the race to rediscover Vectis Templi -- the Lever of the Temple.</description>

Lila didn't think too much about it when she slipped it into her pocket at the mall.

In growing panic, she begins to understand the hell her world has just become. By the looks of things, others have tried to escape… but failed. And even if Lila can survive, some parts of her may be lost forever…</description>

  <description>On a remote Scottish island, American antique dealer Kate Hamilton sleuths a killing that eerily replicates a murder still unsolved after 200 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autumn has come and gone on Scotland's Isle of Rothsay, and the locals gather for the Tartan Ball, the annual end-of-tourist-season gala. Among the invited guests is American antique dealer Kate Hamilton. Returning to the island where her husband died is brutal, but Kate is determined to repair her relationship with her sister-in-law, Elenor Spurgeon, the proprietor of Rothsay's deluxe country house hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate has hardly unpacked when a body turns up, murdered in an eerie recreation of an infamous unsolved murder two hundred years before. And the only clue to the killer's identity lies in a curiously embellished antique casket. When Bo Duff, the gentle handyman who had tried to save Kate’s husband's life, is taken into custody, she teams up with vacationing Detective Inspector Tom Mallory to clear Bo’s name. To accomplish that, they’ll have to unmask a killer who seems bizarrely fixated on the past…because two hundred years is an awfully long time to hold a grudge in A Dream of Death, the tantalizing series debut by Connie Berry.</description>

  <description>Gerry Wade é por todos conhecido como um inveterado dorminhoco. Aquando de uma festa organizada em Chimneys, o seu grupo de amigos decide pregar-lhe uma partida memorável. Na cidade vizinha compram oito relógios despertadores, com os quais estão decididos a sobressaltá-lo durante o sono. A noite passa mas as suas expectativas saem goradas quando o atroador toque dos relógios não exerce qualquer efeito sobre Gerry. Tinham razão ao esperar um efeito surpreendente, mas não podiam imaginar que fosse tão trágico. Poderá o relógio desaparecido explicar tão fatal mistério?</description>

I did enjoy the repartee of the English upper class, aptly thrown in for obfuscation by Dame Agatha, but the story it...]]>

  <description>Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are summoned to Theobald Grange, the Warwickshire home of Lady Heminworth. Being of a nervous and superstitious disposition, her Ladyship lives in fear. Her husband and elder son were recently murdered, apparently by the ghost of a court jester who was executed on the site centuries before. The apparition has warned that she, too, is to die. Holmes rejects a supernatural explanation, although his adversary seems unaffected by gunfire and is able to take flight and disappear. The Great Detective brings his powers to bear, but still the killings continue...</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a thoroughly entertaining pastiche, very much in the style of Conan Doyle. If it has any faults, it's that it's overly complicated, and some of the action is a bit contrived. Nevertheless, it's a satisfying read for anyone eager for more tales of the Master.]]>

  <description>In 2015, The MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories burst upon the scene, featuring over sixty new traditional Sherlock Holmes adventures, all set within the correct time period, and written by many of today’s leading Sherlockian authors from around the world. This first anthology, spread over three huge volumes, was the largest collection of its kind ever assembled in one place. Response was immediately and overwhelmingly positive, and there were soon calls for additional volumes. The result is this new collection, the next in an ongoing series, featuring twenty-two more Holmes investigations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his first appearance in print in 1887, the popularity of Sherlock Holmes has only increased. Although originally chronicled in just sixty exploits, the number of additional Holmes tales discovered since then is literally in the tens of thousands. Along with those original narratives published by Dr. Watson’s first literary agent, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, countless other people have managed to find their way to Watson’s Tin Dispatch Box in order to reveal more exciting cases featuring the Great Detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These accounts stretch from one of Holmes’s earliest cases, later recounted to Watson as they sit by the fire in the Baker Street sitting room, to an adventure just before Holmes’s retirement that affects both the ancient history and the very future of England. These and all the other excellent tales contained in this volume represent some of the finest new Holmesian storytelling to be found, and honor the man described by Watson as “the best and wisest ... whom I have ever known.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anthology features contributions by: Derrick Belanger, Deanna Baran, Daniel D. Victor, Mark Mower, Craig Janacek, Jayantika Ganguly, Denis O. Smith, Matthew Booth, J.R. Campbell, Bonnie MacBird, Arthur Hall, Bob Byrne, Andrew Lane, Roger Johnson, Hugh Ashton, David Stuart Davies, Vincent W. Wright, Daniel McGachey, Nicholas Utechin, Jeremy Holstein, David Marcum, and Marcia Wilson, as well as a poem by Andrea Mantin Levy, and forewords by David Marcum, Steven Rothman, Richard Doyle, Steve Emecz, and Melissa Farnham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This fourth volume continues the tradition set by the first three books in the series. The twenty-three items in this book include twice as many that I rate as excellent as the few I rate only as good. All the rest I rate as very good and that gives the entire volume a rating of 'excellent' as compared to any other Anthology.” - Philip K Jones</description>

  <description>Enthralling. Gripping. Cinematic. Raw. A cold case murder investigation paced like a podcast, as visually stunning as a film, and as brave and personal as our darkest memoirs. J. Reuben Appelman cracks open one of America’s most notorious murder sprees while simultaneously banging the gavel on his own history with violence. A deftly-crafted true crime story with grit, set amid the decaying sprawl of Detroit and its outliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a foreword by Catherine Broad, sister of victim Timothy King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four children were abducted and murdered outside of Detroit during the winters of 1976 and 1977, their bodies eventually dumped in snow banks around the city. J. Reuben Appelman was six years old at the time the murders began and had evaded an abduction attempt during that same period, fueling a lifelong obsession with what became known as the Oakland County Child Killings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Autopsies showed the victims to have been fed while in captivity, reportedly held with care. And yet, with equal care, their bodies had allegedly been groomed post-mortem, scrubbed-free of evidence that might link to a killer. There were few credible leads, and equally few credible suspects. That’s what the cops had passed down to the press, and that’s what the city of Detroit, and J. Reuben Appelman, had come to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the abductions mysteriously stopped, a task force operating on one of the largest manhunt budgets in history shut down without an arrest. Although no more murders occurred, Detroit and its environs remained haunted. The killer had, presumably, not been caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eerily overlaid upon the author’s own decades-old history with violence, &lt;i&gt;The Kill Jar&lt;/i&gt; tells the gripping story of J. Reuben Appelman’s ten-year investigation into buried leads, apparent police cover-ups of evidence, con-men, child pornography rings, and high-level corruption saturating Detroit’s most notorious serial killer case.</description>

  <description>Bullet wounds heal, but a broken heart is something else entirely. Natalie McMasters is twenty-one, short and blonde (OK, it’s bleached), a way cute former stripper and a pre-law student at State. Nattie also works as a private detective at her uncle’s 3M detective agency. After her last case, in which she was nearly killed, she’s faced with a new, daunting challenge. She must trace the most important person in her life – who doesn’t want to be found – through the squalid sexworld of New York City. Even with help from old and new friends, Natalie will need more persistence and courage than she’s ever shown before if she is to prevail in her most difficult and personal challenge. Trafficked! - A Natalie McMasters Mystery is full of the action, suspense, and unexpected plot twists that Nattie’s many fans thrive on. You totally won’t be disappointed!</description>

As it becomes clear a nuclear threat is imminent, Galeno has no choice but to trust his fellow agent to preserve millions of lives…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the clock counts down to obliteration, can Moylan and Galeno take out the deadly cell before extremists trigger an urban nuclear Armageddon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Last Day is a gripping terrorist thriller.

  <description>Edgar® Award-winning and New York Times bestselling author C.J. Box delivers a thriller about a troubled cop trying to save his son from a killer in Yellowstone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody Hoyt, while a brilliant cop, is an alcoholic struggling with two months of sobriety when his mentor and AA sponsor Hank Winters is found burned to death in a remote mountain cabin. At first it looks like the suicide of a man who's fallen off the wagon, but Cody knows Hank better than that. Sober for fourteen years, Hank took pride in his hard-won sobriety and never hesitated to drop whatever he was doing to talk Cody off a ledge. When Cody takes a closer look at the scene of his friend's death, it becomes apparent that foul play is at hand. After years of bad behavior with his department, he's in no position to be investigating a homicide, but this man was a friend and Cody's determined to find his killer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When clues found at the scene link the murderer to an outfitter leading tourists on a multi-day wilderness horseback trip into the remote corners of Yellowstone National Park--a pack trip that includes his son Justin--Cody is desperate to get on their trail and stop the killer before the group heads into the wild. Among the tourists is fourteen-year-old Gracie Sullivan, an awkward but intelligent loner who begins to suspect that someone in their party is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a fatal cat and mouse game, where it becomes apparent the murderer is somehow aware of Cody's every move, Cody treks into the wilderness to stop a killer hell bent on ruining the only thing in his life he cares about.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back of Beyond&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;Best of 2011 Mysteries title.</description>

  <description>What is meant as a fresh start in the English Lakes District begins to reek of buried secrets....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxford historian and TV personality Daniel Kind and his new lover, Miranda, both want to escape to a new life. On impulse they buy Tarn Cottage in Brackdale, an idyllic valley in the Lake District that Daniel knew as a boy. He is still fascinated by a place so remote that the dead had to be carried out over the peaks on pack animals along the ancient Coffin Trail. But though the couple hope to live the dream of downsizing, the past has a way of catching up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarn Cottage was once home to Barrie Gilpin, an autistic youth suspected of a savage murder-what looks like the ritualistic killing of a young woman visitor to the valley. She was found laid out on the Sacrifice Stone, an ancient pagan site up on the fell. Barrie fell to his death near the crime scene before he could be questioned. All these years later, Daniel retains his belief in Barrie's innocence and questions his own policeman father's handling of the case. When DCI Hannah Scarlett and her squad launch a cold case review, Brackdale's skeletons begin to rattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wild geography of the Lakes District plays against local literary references, all backdrop to the lives of villagers and outsiders drawn to this beautiful spot - but for what reasons? The Coffin Trail launches a new series by a master British hand.</description>

  <description>When a bomb destroys the recently formed Special Irish Branch of Scotland Yard, all fingers point to the increasingly brazen factions of Irish dissidents seeking liberation from English rule. Volunteering their services to the British government, Barker and Llewelyn set out to infiltrate a secret cell of the Irish Republican Brotherhood known as the Invisibles. Posing as a reclusive German bomb maker and his anarchist apprentice, they are recruited for the group's ultimate plan: to bring London to its knees and end the monarchy forever.Their adventures take them from a lighthouse on the craggy coast of Wales to a Liverpool infested with radicals, and even to the City of Light, where Llewelyn goes undercover with Maire O'Casey, the alluring sister of an Irish radical. Llewelyn again finds himself put to the test by his enigmatic employer, studying the art of self-defense and the brutal sport of hurling -- and, most dangerous of all, being schooled in the deadly science of bomb making.</description>

  <description>In 1917, Jessie Carr, fourteen years old and sole heiress to her family's vast fortune, disappeared without a trace. Now, years later, her uncle Oliver Beckett thinks he's found her: a young actress in a vaudeville playhouse is a dead ringer for his missing niece. But when Oliver confronts the girl, he learns he's wrong. Orphaned young, Leah's been acting since she was a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver, never one to miss an opportunity, makes a proposition—with his coaching, Leah can impersonate Jessie, claim the fortune, and split it with him. The role of a lifetime, he says. A one-way ticket to Sing Sing, she hears. But when she's let go from her job, Oliver's offer looks a lot more appealing. Leah agrees to the con, but secretly promises herself to try and find out what happened to the real Jessie. There's only one problem: Leah's act won't fool the one person who knows the truth about Jessie's disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against a Prohibition-era backdrop of speakeasies and vaudeville houses, Mary Miley's Minotaur Books/Mystery Writers of America First Crime Novel Competition winner &lt;i&gt;The Impersonator&lt;/i&gt; will delight readers with its elaborate mystery and lively prose.</description>

  <description>In 2015, The MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories burst upon the scene, featuring over sixty new traditional Sherlock Holmes adventures, all set within the correct time period, and written by many of today's leading Sherlockian authors from around the world. This first anthology, spread over three huge volumes, was the largest collection of its kind ever assembled in one place. Response was immediately and overwhelmingly positive, and there were soon calls for additional volumes. The result is this new collection, the next in an ongoing series, featuring twenty-two more Holmes investigations. Since his first appearance in print in 1887, the popularity of Sherlock Holmes has only increased. Although originally chronicled in just sixty exploits, the number of additional Holmes tales discovered since then is literally in the tens of thousands. Along with those original narratives published by Dr. Watson's first literary agent, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, countless other people have managed to find their way to Watson's Tin Dispatch Box in order to reveal more exciting cases featuring the Great Detective. These accounts stretch from one of Holmes's earliest cases, later recounted to Watson as they sit by the fire in the Baker Street sitting room, to an adventure just before Holmes's retirement that affects both the ancient history and the very future of England. These and all the other excellent tales contained in this volume represent some of the finest new Holmesian storytelling to be found, and honor the man described by Watson as "the best and wisest . . . whom I have ever known." All royalties from this collection are being donated by the writers for the benefit of the preservation of Undershaw, one of the former homes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The "Part IV: 2016 Annual" features contributions by: Derrick Belanger, Deanna Baran, Daniel D. Victor, Mark Mower, Craig Janacek, Jayantika Ganguly, Denis O. Smith, Matthew Booth, J.R. Campbell, Bonnie MacBird, Arthur Hall, Bob Byrne, Andrew Lane, Roger Johnson, Hugh Ashton, David Stuart Davies, Vincent W. Wright, Daniel McGachey, Nicholas Utechin, Jeremy Holstein, David Marcum, and Marcia Wilson, as well as a poem by Andrea Mantin Levy, and forewords by David Marcum, Steven Rothman, Richard Doyle, Steve Emecz, and Melissa Farnham.</description>

  <description>Private Investigator Jim Bean is a straightforward, to-the-point man. When his latest client, Sophie Evers, asks him to find her brother Daniel, Jim has no idea how complicated his life is about to become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel is not Sophie's brother. He is her most coveted prey. Clinging to the belief that they belong together, Sophie kills Daniel's real sister to manipulate Jim into flushing Daniel out of hiding. She will create the "perfect life" for the only man she's ever loved, no matter how many people she must kill along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jim discovers the truth about Sophie, he's driven to set things right before her delusional plan claims even more souls.</description>

  <description>Attorney Paul Madriani defends a highly decorated soldier who is on trial for murder, and unwittingly steps into a maze of secrets and lies that the government - and even this client - would rather leave hidden and undisturbed.&lt;p&gt;Madriani is faced with arcane ballistics evidence, the so-called double tap - two bullet wounds tightly grouped to a victim's head, from shots that can have been made only by a crack marksman. Madriani's client is an enigma, a career soldier who refuses to talk about his past, though clearly he is a battle-tested pro. The victim was an alluring businesswoman and software tycoon whose empire catered to the military, and the most damning evidence is the weapon that killed her: a handgun used solely in special operations where the double tap is the trademark of the most skilled assassins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madriani begins to have new fears about his client, a man who would rather sit on a legal time bomb than talk about his past and get a chance at acquittal. And yet more troubling, Madriani discovers that the victim was involved in a controversial government contract to combat terrorism by combing through the private computer records of millions of American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madriani faces a wilderness of mirrors in a courtroom battle where every witness can hide behind "national security," where information is power and digital information is absolute power. It is a war in which the scales of justice are being tipped by evasion, deceit - and murder. Finding the unvarnished truth has never been so elusive - or so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a brilliantly twisted debut set among Boston’s elite, Edwin Hill introduces unforgettable sleuth Hester Thursby—and a missing persons case that uncovers a trail of vicious murder . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Harvard librarian Hester Thursby knows that even in the digital age, people still need help finding things. Using her research skills, Hester runs a side business tracking down the lost. Usually, she’s hired to find long-ago prom dates or to reunite adopted children and birth parents. Her new case is finding the handsome and charismatic Sam Blaine.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sam has no desire to be found. As a teenager, he fled his small New Hampshire town with his friend, Gabe, after a haunting incident. For a dozen years, Sam and Gabe have traveled the country, reinventing themselves as they move from one mark to another. Sam has learned how trusting wealthy people can be—especially the lonely ones—as he expertly manipulates his way into their lives and homes.  In Wendy Richards, the beautiful, fabulously rich daughter of one of Boston’s most influential families, he’s found the perfect way to infiltrate the milieu in which he knows he belongs—a world of Brooks Brothers suits, Nantucket summers, and effortless glamour.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As Hester’s investigation closes in on their brutal truth, the bond between Sam and Gabe is tested and Hester unknowingly jeopardizes her own safety. While Gabe has pinned all his desperate hopes of a normal life on Hester, Sam wants her out of the way for good. And Gabe has always done what Sam asks . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;I’m running from the LAPD and my evil step father. I wasn’t expecting Aiden, Andre, Gareth, and Casey.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother finally calls to tell me she’s ready to leave my abusive, corrupt cop of a step father. I planned our escape down to T. I planned for everything except Jake being there when I got to her house. I shot him…with his own gun…in the worst place you can possibly wound a man. He yelled he was never going to stop looking for me and I would pay as I fled my life in LA. Jake always wanted my trust fund. I knew if he ever found me, I wouldn’t survive the encounter. He’d probably torture me first for what I did to him with his own gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fled to New Orleans, thinking to hide among the tourists. The first thing I did was go to a salon to change my looks. There’s a huge, sexy, tattooed man sitting there getting a pedicure. He’s probably one of the most infuriating men I’ve ever met, trying to dictate my makeover and trying to convince me to come stay with him and his probably equally infuriating buddies. I underestimated the rum content in the drinks at the restaurant I agree to go eat with them at because I was starving and wake up in their huge fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make the best of my situation. I get to know Andre, the billionaire software developer who owns this huge house, Gareth, the wisecracking security guard, Aiden, the sensitive artist, and I don’t even know what to make of Casey. Casey totally avoids me. I jump at the chance when they all say they want to get to know me better. It’ll get my mind off my secret and they all want to protect me without asking what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;But how can I pick? What is Casey hiding? Will Jake find me here and hurt my new friends?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;u&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Dangerous Chess&lt;/strong&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Her Cop (Casey)&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/u&gt;
   
   
    &lt;u&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Her Artist (Aiden)&lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;u&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Her Guard (Gareth)&lt;/em&gt;

      <![CDATA[Fugitve: Misty is first and foremost an erotic fantasy. There is no great writing or any attempt at realism here. I am not a fan of eroticism, mainly because there are just so many ways one can describe sex, so for me, repetitive sex scenes tend to become boring. The book also touches on polyamor...]]>

  <description>Taz I’Ane – arrogant, irreverent, womanising – Heir Apparent to the House of Nikaris, the largest and most powerful House in the Vampire Nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morganna Satori, top of the chain of the world’s deadliest and most feared assassins – as lethal as she is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people who couldn’t be more opposite. And whose only connection to one-another is a torrid one night’s stand in Las Vegas, six months past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they have been thrown together to investigate a string of grisly murders, perpretrated by what appears to be a homicidal mad man in control of a savage army of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is not whether or not they can survive their seemingly impossible assignment. But whether they will survive each other.</description>

      <![CDATA[Bonded in Blood could be retitled James Bond meets the vampires. It's a fun, wild ride that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is - a cracking good adventure story. The authors have created a rich vampire lore to underpin the story and the characters are witty and debonair. The plot is i...]]>

  <description>Lauren Riley is an accomplished detective who has always been on the opposite side of the courtroom from her nemesis, slick defense attorney Frank Violanti. But now he's begging to hire her as a private investigator to help clear his client of murder. At first Lauren refuses, wanting nothing to do with the media circus surrounding that case—until she meets the eighteen-year-old suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep an innocent teen from life in prison, Lauren must unravel the conflicting evidence and changing stories to get at the buried facts. But the more she digs, the more she discovers that nothing is what it first appears to be. As Lauren puts her career and life in danger, doubt starts to lurk on every corner . . . and so does her stalker.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A favor for a friend turns into a murder investigation, drawing apprentice PI Willa Pennington into a labyrinth of lies and deception in the shadows of Washington, D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa Pennington thought that becoming a PI would be better than being a cop. She thought she'd never have to make another death notification or don a bulletproof vest again. She thought she could move past the pain of losing her best friend. She thought she'd be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she couldn't have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, agreeing to do a simple favor has brought her to a dead body, a missing person, and a battle of wits with an old friend who has dangerous secrets. If Willa can keep her focus, she could solve the murder, find the missing girl, and figure out if the person she's trusted with her life is the one trying to end it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2019 Lefty Award Nominee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2018 Agatha Award Nominee for Best First Novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"One of the best debut efforts I've ever seen. Tight plotting, edge-of-your-seat suspense and a protagonist in PI Willa Pennington you'll want to read about again and again. I couldn't put this book down."--Maggie Barbieri, author of &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Lie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A debut that saddles tough-girl noir with the heart of a cozy."--&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is a solid beginning to a character and setting that could go on to very good things."--&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aimee Hix is an up-and-coming author everyone should watch."--&lt;em&gt;Crimespree Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The book has plent of twists and surprises, but what stands out is the tight writing and fast narrative of the author's debut novel."--&lt;em&gt;Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mid-December, and Cambridgeshire is blanketed with snow. Detective Sergeant Manon Bradshaw tries to sleep after yet another soul-destroying Internet date – the low murmuring of her police radio her only solace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the airwaves come reports of a missing woman – door ajar, keys and phone left behind, a spatter of blood on the kitchen floor. Manon knows the first 72 hours are critical: you find her, or you look for a body. And as soon as she sees a picture of Edith Hind, a Cambridge post-graduate from a well-connected family, she knows this case will be big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Edith alive or dead? Was her ‘complex love life’ at the heart of her disappearance, as a senior officer tells the increasingly hungry press? And when a body is found, is it the end or only the beginning?</description>

  <description>I'm SO over that gorgeous, scary, heartbreaking man who hates my guts. &lt;br /&gt;I'm just counting on him to save my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never, ever fall for your brother's hot older friend. &lt;br /&gt;I flunked the test the instant I laid eyes on Landon Strauss. &lt;br /&gt;Tall. Ripped. Commanding. Irresistibly alpha. &lt;br /&gt;He gave a damn like no one else did. &lt;br /&gt;His soul-searing eyes saw me, not just a nerd girl next door. &lt;br /&gt;I had my idol, my destiny, and names for our future kids picked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I read Landon's little black book. &lt;br /&gt;One nosy peek exposed the shock of a lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;His confession. His pain. His plan. &lt;br /&gt;The sweet boy I loved was gone. &lt;br /&gt;Hero-turned-villain-turned-bad-memory overnight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Five years later, an insane slip of fate puts us under the same roof. &lt;br /&gt;Sweet closure, I think. &lt;br /&gt;I almost forget he hates me. &lt;br /&gt;I almost think we'll talk like normal adults. &lt;br /&gt;I don't expect the shirtless behemoth who comes barreling through my door. &lt;br /&gt;Landon's grown up. All snarls, testosterone, and lethal chemistry. &lt;br /&gt;We're in trouble, he says. &lt;br /&gt;Oh, Landon. Oh, baby, don't I know it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Wall Street Journal bestselling author Nicole Snow – a tale of two hearts torn, stomped, and dragged through the mud. An uber-alpha protector bent on reclaiming his nerd next door. Full length romance novel with a Happily Ever After worth a “hell yeah.”&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Stripped of their birthright and shunned by the people of Ashlund, Una and her family are forced to live on the fringe of society as Scavengers. There is no question that her family's bond is strong, but the law of the Authority is stronger...and soon it will come to collect her. After all, the family is on borrowed time already. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a night of torment and truth reveals well kept secrets, Una takes new freedoms - free from the Authority, her family, and possibly her fate. Pulled between the life she's always known and a world where status and rituals are everything, Una struggles to understand a culture that has rejected all she holds dear. As Atchem comes to an end and she learns who she really is, will Una find the courage to do what it takes to ensure her family's survival, or will she find the faith to follow her heart?</description>

  <description>Ari is fat, ugly and unlovable. At least that’s what she thinks. Ari’s father left when she was twelve leaving her mother emotionally unavailable. When Ari was a high school freshman, she was raped; and since has developed depression, anxiety, and an obsession with death and suicide. Sarah is Ari’s cousin and only real friend, and though still a teenager, she could easily pass for twenty-five—which she often did, until she was arrested for selling drugs. Newly released from prison, Sarah struggles to adjust to legal weed and reconnecting with her cousin. But old habits die hard, and when Ari’s mother is called out of town, Sarah sees an opportunity to unload a bunch of E by bullying Ari into having an epic party. That night sets off a chain of events that exposes secrets, lies, and thought-to-be buried truths as Ari and Sarah embark on a drug-fueled, hormone-driven, chain-smoking journey of self-discovery, enlightenment, and revenge.</description>

  <description>Imagine a helpless, pregnant 16-year-old who's just been yanked from the serenity of her home and shoved into a dirty van. Kidnapped. Alone. Terrified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now forget her ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture instead a pregnant, 16-year-old, manipulative prodigy. She is shoved into a dirty van and, from the first moment of her kidnapping, feels a calm desire for two things: to save her unborn son and to exact merciless revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is methodical, calculating, scientific in her plotting. A clinical sociopath? Leaving nothing to chance, secure in her timing and practice, she waits for the perfect moment to strike. &lt;i&gt;Method 15/33&lt;/i&gt; is what happens when the victim is just as cold as the captors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agents trying to find a kidnapped girl have their own frustrations and desires wrapped into this chilling drama. In the twists of intersecting stories, one is left to ponder. Who is the victim? Who is the aggressor?</description>

  <description>Detective John Stone of the NYPD has the best arrest record in the 43rd precinct. But he’s a dinosaur who belongs to another age. Detective Carmen Dehan has such a bad attitude that nobody at the precinct can stomach her. Captain Jennifer Cuevas wants them both out of the way and thinks they make a perfect pair. So she gives them the Cold Cases file – the cases nobody gives a damn about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has no idea just how hot a cold case can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years back Nelson Hernandez and his four cousins were playing poker in a dive at Hunts Point. Somebody came in, blew them away and beheaded and castrated Nelson, leaving his head and his balls on the table. There was no shortage of suspects, the Jersey Mob, the Triads from Manhattan, or the 43rds own bent cop, Mick Harragan. But nobody was ever charged, and the night of the murder Mick Harragan went missing with Nelson’s wife, Maria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Stone and Dehan plan to find him – whatever the consequences…</description>

      <![CDATA[The Wrylin is a fantasy with a refreshingly original premise, something that is sorely lacking these days. However, its greatest flaw is the lack of editing. <br /><br />The tone of the book reminded me of Eddins' Belgariad and the characters, especially Kathely and Joel, had the same kind of folksiness, whi...]]>

  <description>Henrietta Von Harmon works as a 26 girl at a corner bar on Chicago s northwest side. It s 1935, but things still aren t looking up since the big crash and her father s subsequent suicide, leaving Henrietta to care for her antagonistic mother and younger siblings. Henrietta is eventually persuaded to take a job as a taxi dancer at a local dance hall and just when she s beginning to enjoy herself, the floor matron turns up dead. When aloof Inspector Clive Howard appears on the scene, Henrietta agrees to go undercover for him and is plunged into Chicago s grittier underworld. Meanwhile, she s still busy playing mother hen to her younger siblings, as well as to pesky neighborhood boy Stanley, who believes himself in love with her and keeps popping up in the most unlikely places, determined to keep Henrietta safe even from the Inspector, if need be. Despite his efforts, however, and his penchant for messing up the Inspector s investigation, the lovely Henrietta and the impenetrable Inspector find themselves drawn to each other in most unsuitable ways."</description>

  <description>'The Erotic Muse' is the story of K, a young porn-addicted college-dropout who shies away from relationships and harbors dreams of becoming a writer. Full of anguish, he is given to self-abuse. One evening, while masturbating to his favorite erotic muse, Fanny Leone, sprawled on the cover of an underground porn magazine, K finds himself magically transported to a parallel world where all sexual desires and perversions are fulfilled, although with the price that he might remain trapped in this unique pleasure-hell all his life – unless he can find a way out. This 'way out' is his redemption, a journey studded with heart-stopping adventure, life-threatening danger, nerve-wracking horror, and a brush with true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This book contains graphic descriptions of a sexual nature, some of them involving rape fantasies. Readers who are bothered by such scenes may choose to skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Universal Book Link (Amazon/Kobo/Nook/Apple/Angus &amp;amp; Robertson/24 Symbols):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://books2read.com/u/3k0aDR" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://books2read.com/u/3k0aDR&lt;/a&gt;</description>

In places, the prose absolutely scintillates but in others, it drags.

  <description>As any student of the great detective is aware, Doctor Watson did not publish all the adventures of his friend, Sherlock Holmes. He refers to some of these untold tales in the published canon, giving us tantalising hints of how Holmes was employed when not engaged in the recorded cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume here contains a wealth of eighteen such Sherlockian treasures within it, recovered from the second box to be delivered to Hugh Ashton (the first contained those adventures published in the "Deed Box" series).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two exceptions, these stories have appeared previously in print, in the Dispatch-box series published by Inknbeans Press.Here, though, for the first time in one edition, in homage to the original style of The Strand Magazine, are the adventures of Sherlock Holmes in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Affair of the Vatican Cameos&lt;br /&gt;The Reigate Poisoning Case&lt;br /&gt;The Reigate Poisoning Case: Concluded&lt;br /&gt;The Story of John Henry Augustus Clay (as told by himself)&lt;br /&gt;The Abernetty Horror&lt;br /&gt;The Adventure of the Finsbury House&lt;br /&gt;The Curious Affair of the Archdeacon&lt;br /&gt;An Account of the Victor Lynch Forgery (by Inspector Lestrade)&lt;br /&gt;The Russian Bear&lt;br /&gt;The Adventure of the Hand of Glory&lt;br /&gt;The Adventure of the Disappearing Spoon&lt;br /&gt;The Lichfield Murder&lt;br /&gt;The Case of the Two Detectives&lt;br /&gt;The Tarleton Murders&lt;br /&gt;The Case of the Abominable Wife&lt;br /&gt;Vamberry the Wine Merchant&lt;br /&gt;The Singular Affair of the Aluminium Crutch&lt;br /&gt;The Adventure of the Two Bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Ashton has been praised as being one of the authors who come closest to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his depiction of the great detective and his world.</description>

  <description>Despite a planned move, the mysterious death of photographer Bryn Wallace keeps American writer Nora Tierney glued to Oxford in order to clear her close friend, artist Val Rogan, who has been wrongfully accused of Bryn's murder. Or has she? Nora quickly becomes embroiled in the murder investigation, much to the dismay of two men: Detective Inspector Declan Barnes, the senior on the case; and Simon Ramsey, the illustrator of Nora's children's book. Simon's efforts to save Nora from herself become increasingly frantic as Nora is forced to push her way into Declan's case, using her wits and her wiles to prove Val's innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first in a series of Nora Tierney mysteries based in the UK, THE BLUE VIRGIN is a compelling story of love and intrigue. Nothing, Nora learns, is what it seems, and even the most innocent of choices can lead to murder and revenge. Set in the ancient city of golden spires, the setting lends itself to mystery, as any Inspector Morse fan will agree. The novel is written in classic English style, complete with a Cast of Characters and chapter epigraphs which add to its literary feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME OF DEATH author Ellis Vidler has this to say about the novel: "THE BLUE VIRGIN flows like a river, smooth but powerful, with small streams feeding into the story, adding to the depth and richness. It carries the reader through twists and turns but never falters. Nora Tierney, adapting to a surprise pregnancy but always there to support the people she loves, captured me right away. The varied personalities and eccentricities of the other characters play off each other and keep things interesting. The mystery is solid, and Ms. Graff's knowledge of Oxford comes through in the details without ever slowing the pace. Graff is an excellent writer who never jars or misses a step. I highly recommend this book."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHOKE CREEK author Lauren Small adds: "I'm a big fan or mysteries and now count THE BLUE VIRGIN as one of my favorites. Nora Tierney makes a great accidental sleuth, and there's a rich cast of characters for her to suspect--and investigate. People who love psychological mystery writers like Ruth Rendell or classic authors like Agatha Christie will love M. K. Graff."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan Seliger Sidney, author of BODY OF DIMINISHING MOTION says: "In her stunning, debut mystery novel set in Oxford, England, M. K. Graff keeps the reader guessing who-done-it. Her sophisticated literary style together with her compelling plot and cast of characters make the book impossible to put down."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The editor of Sideshow Press, Toni Amato, notes: "Graff is wise in the ways of human hearts. THE BLUE VIRGIN reveals out desires and devotions in all of their glorious and grotesque possibilities. No one character is simple, and no one perspective wins primacy of place, yet through the eyes of protagonist Nora Tierney, we are shown all this is most deeply human. Along the way, Graff tells a damn fine story."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of BRIGHT WINGS BROKEN, Liz Jones, comments: "THE BLUE VIRGIN is a suspenseful and urgent novel, immediately gaining the reader's interest. Graff has created distinctive, well-drawn characters--some sympathetic or strong, others sinister or creepy or annoying-but all are highly memorable, while the descriptive setting paints a true picture of this lovely area."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewer Marley Clark notes: "THE BLUE VIRGIN is a delightful read in the best of mystery (especially British) traditions. Graff's characters are not only engaging, but they're realistic with all of the self-doubts, joys and sorrows of living, breathing women and men. The Oxford setting is an additional character in the book. You'll feel you're right there with the characters, having high tea and walking down cobblestone streets.</description>

  <description>Business has been slow for Private Investigator, Delanie Fitzgerald, but her luck seems to change when a tell-all author hires her to find rock star, Johnny Velvet. Could the singer whose career purportedly ended in a fiery crash almost thirty years ago, still be alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as though sifting through dead ends in a cold case isn’t bad enough, Chaz Wellington Smith, III, a loud-mouthed, strip club owner, also hires Delanie to uncover information about the mayor’s secret life. When the mayor is murdered, Chaz, is the key suspect. Now Delanie must clear his name and figure out why landscaper Tripp Payne, keeps popping up in her other investigation. Can the private investigator find the connection between the two cases before another murder – possibly her own – takes place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Lives and Private Eyes is a fast-paced mystery that appeals to readers who like a strong, female sleuth with a knack for getting herself in and out of humorous situations.</description>

  <description>For fans of Anne Canadeo comes a fun and sassy cozy mystery in which one woman must solve the murder of a book group member and untangle a web of secrets hidden by her bookish cohorts. &lt;br /&gt;Hazel Rose never dreamed that the murder mystery book group she and her friend Carlene started would stage a "real "murder. &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, on the night when the normally composed Carlene seems unusually angry and rattled, during group discussion she dies after drinking cyanide-spiked tea. Despite a suicide note, Hazel is skeptical; Carlene never seemed suicidal--why else would she make all those plans for her future? Incidentally, Carlene was married to Hazel's ex-husband, and Hazel has always suspected there might be something more to her past than she let on. &lt;br /&gt;How much does anyone really know about Carlene Arness? And did she die by her own hand or someone else's? Hazel begins a search for the truth that produces no shortage of motives, as she unearths a past that Carlene took great pains to hide. And most of those motives belong to the members of her very own book group... &lt;br /&gt;Featuring memorable characters and a wicked sense of humor, "Murder at the Book Group" shows the darker side of a book club where reading isn't about pleasure--it's about payback.</description>

  <description>Trudy Genova has the best job any nurse could want, working on set as a medical consultant for a NY movie studio. No more uniforms, bedpans or emergencies, until the actor whose overtures she's refused dies suddenly while taping a hospital scene--but not before pointing his finger accusingly at Trudy. When detectives view Trudy as a suspect, she sets out on an investigation to clear her name. Then a second death occurs, and Trudy realizes she's put herself in jeopardy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A new mystery from the award-winning author of the Nora Tierney English Mystery Series, DEATH UNSCRIPTED is based on the authors' real work experience during her nursing career and is the mystery series British Queen of Crime P. D. James insisted she write. A mix of amateur sleuth and police procedural, the story is told in first person from Trudy's point of view, and in third from NYPD Detective Ned O'Malley &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marilyn Chris, Obie and Drama Desk Award-winning actor who played Wanda Wolek on ABC's soap "One Life to Live" notes: "Graff gets behind the scenes of soaps just right, as well she should--she was there!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Edith Maxell, national bestselling author of multiple mystery series says: "Your blood pressure will soar during M. K. Graff's new Manhattan Mystery, as nurse Trudy Genova takes the pulse of a killer during a soap opera filming in Death Unscripted. You won't even think about changing the channel during this smart, suspenseful mystery." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Triss Stein, author of the Erica Donato Mysteries, has this to say: "Soap opera drama is as intense on the set as it is on the screen. Sometimes Trudy Genova, consulting nurse, feels like the only sane person in the room. Join her as she copes with huge ego, daily melodrama, an attractive detective, and life in New York . . . plus murder. The city and the studio provide intriguing backgrounds for this entertaining mystery." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Helen Smith, UK author of the The Emily Castle Mysteries, agrees that Death Unscripted is "an engaging story featuring a charming amateur sleuth. A great start to a mystery series."</description>

  <description>When her sorority sisters are engaged in sex, drugs, and rock and roll, the unnamed narrator finds her true calling in life when she kills her first victim. She doesn't have a neon sign stating, "Warning, Serial Killer," following her around. She delights in the realization that her role separates her from the people around her. A chameleon by nature, she exploits her ethic and sexual ambiguity to hide in plain sight. She kills up close and personal, because she wants her victims to know they are about to die. And she remains active for nearly three decades.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong> A Horrifying and Absorbing Tale</strong><br /><br />The most horrifying thing about Eyes Without a Face is the cool, dispassionate narration. It makes the killer totally believable and totally human. One can't help but think the narrator is really out there somewhere, and maybe even hope so.]]>

  <description>When two rookie cops are killed in a fiery crash near Richmond, Virginia, crime reporter Nichelle Clarke is sent in to investigate. She assumes it will be routine, a scene like many other accidents she's covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was no ordinary accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as Nichelle digs deeper into the case, people and evidence begin to disappear. Someone is one step ahead of her, desperate to cover their tracks. A master criminal with a deadly secret, who will stop at nothing to keep the truth hidden...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she draws closer to unraveling the mystery of two dead cops, Nichelle realizes she's become the next target. Can she survive this murderous game of cat and mouse long enough to solve the mystery? Or will Nichelle fall prey to a killer?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>A good read</strong><br /><br />A solid but predictable offering. I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the ending was somewhat contrived. But it is an enjoyable story and Nichelle Clarke is a likable heroine. I'll read the rest of the series as time permits.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gritty, fast-paced debut thriller, an ex-con biker chick turned law-abiding citizen risks everything to save her new life—and confront the demons of her past.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Shea Stevens is biker royalty. Her father was the president of the Confederate Thunder Motorcycle Club. Under his watchful eye, she learned how to pick locks, disable alarms, and hot-wire cars like a pro. But all that is ancient history. Or so she thought . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After a stint in prison, Shea has worked hard to make a quiet, happy life for herself in Arizona. She spends her time bonding with her big-city girlfriend and running her bike shop, Iron Goddess Custom Cycles, with her dedicated team of misfits. But when one of her employees is shot and three of her specially commissioned bikes are stolen, Shea’s new life collides with the criminal underworld she tried to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Shea knows better than to trust the police. So, with her Glock on her hip, she takes the investigation into her own hands. Shea’s search for the bike thieves leads her straight to her father’s old gang—and her estranged sister, whose young daughter has been kidnapped by a rival club. The last thing Shea wants is to be caught in the middle of a war—but if she learned one thing from her old man, it’s that when someone comes at you, you push back. Hard. And that’s exactly what she’s going to do.</description>

  <description>Ned Spinks, Chief Thief-Catcher has a problem. Someone is stealing the Emperor's roses. But that's not the worst of it. In his infinite wisdom and grace, the Emperor magically imbued his red rose with love so if it was ever removed from the Imperial Rose Gardens then love will be lost, to everyone, forever. It's up to Ned and his band of motley catchers to apprehend the thief and save the day. But the thief isn't exactly who they seem to be, neither is the Emperor. Ned and his team will have to go on a quest defeating vampire mermaids, illusionists, estranged family members and an evil sorcerer in order to win the day. What could possibly go wrong?</description>

  <description>The hero-narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia"—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Gods of Howl Mountain,&lt;/i&gt; award-winning author Taylor Brown explores a world of folk healers, whiskey-runners, and dark family secrets in the high country of 1950s North Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bootlegger Rory Docherty has returned home to the fabled mountain of his childhood - a misty wilderness that holds its secrets close and keeps the outside world at gunpoint. Slowed by a wooden leg and haunted by memories of the Korean War, Rory runs bootleg whiskey for a powerful mountain clan in a retro-fitted '40 Ford coupe. Between deliveries to roadhouses, brothels, and private clients, he lives with his formidable grandmother, evades federal agents, and stokes the wrath of a rival runner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mill town at the foot of the mountains - a hotbed of violence, moonshine, and the burgeoning sport of stock-car racing - Rory is bewitched by the mysterious daughter of a snake-handling preacher. His grandmother, Maybelline “Granny May” Docherty, opposes this match for her own reasons, believing that "some things are best left buried." A folk healer whose powers are rumored to rival those of a wood witch, she concocts potions and cures for the people of the mountains while harboring an explosive secret about Rory’s mother - the truth behind her long confinement in a mental hospital, during which time she has not spoken one word. When Rory's life is threatened, Granny must decide whether to reveal what she knows...or protect her only grandson from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gritty and atmospheric prose, Taylor Brown brings to life a perilous mountain and the family who rules it.</description>

  <description>An unspeakable crime. A confounding investigation. At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>What would you do? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Your wife believes she is suffering side effects and that we are working to bring them under control. What she remembers of Viktor—that will come and go. She will work to maintain her ignorance. We will help her. Her feelings will stay, indeed. . . grow.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“The heat will wax and wane. We will control it. She will learn to obey her heat, to let it control her.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was a metal waste basket to my right, just to the side of my end of the couch. &lt;br /&gt;I threw up into it copiously, violently, and as neatly as I could manage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was on fire, instantly drenched in sweat; my head felt like it was about to explode. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then I was simply gone.</description>

  <description>A contemporary novel tackling issues of sex and sexuality.&lt;br /&gt;Forty years ago four people conspired to conceal a teenage pregnancy. Now one of them is dead and a book about her threatens to expose a Member of Parliament's guilty secret. For how long will Roger be able to prevent Sally getting at the truth of her parentage? Can he prevent the break-up of his own long term gay relationship?&lt;br /&gt;We've come a long way from the prudery still prevalent in post WWII Britain to the acceptance of gay marriage. Did the new found sexual freedoms of the 1970s send the wrong signals to men who regard young women as 'fair game' for predatory behaviour and make recently exposed scandals involving celebrities inevitable?</description>

  <description>Three Novellas written by Alan Vanneman, but incorporating the primary characters in Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series of mysteries. The first novella is set in the 1930s, so as to be appropriate to the original Nero Wolfe stories. The other two have been set in the 21st century. But all three feature Nero Wolfe, mostly either sitting at his desk or upstairs playing with his orchids, and Archie Goodwin doing all the necessary leg work and gathering of data.</description>

  <description>A story for which the world is not yet prepared. In these words Dr. John Watson, in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, describes the legend of Harat, the gigantic rat who ruled over the nation of Bada and its "people who were not human." Their story, hidden for more than a century in Dr. Watson's dispatch box, is now told at last—in a tale as compelling and colorful as any in the Holmes canon. What begins with a brutal "impossible" murder in a dreary London rooming house soon draws the celebrated master of detection, Sherlock Holmes, and his companion, Dr. Watson, into a hunt that takes them from England to Egypt, to India, and on to Singapore before encountering Harat, a creature even With a case as confounding as any in the original Holmes canon and a tale so terrifying it lay hidden for more than a century in Dr. Watson's dispatch box, Sherlock Holmes and the Giant Rat of Sumatra begins familiarly enough. Elizabeth Trent, a bereft widow determined to clear her husband's name of both suicide and embezzlement, visits literature's most celebrated detective at his Baker Street flat. Within hours, though, Mrs. Trent herself is dead, and her curious suicide note draws Holmes and Watson into a hunt for a brutal murderer that takes them from England to Egypt, to India, and finally to the city Mrs. Trent has fled—rich, mysterious Singapore. Throughout the course of their sea journey Holmes and Watson contend with a series of formidable foes, and continually the two travelers uncover connections between their enemies and the cunning, ruthless colonial master of Singapore, Lord Barington. They also find an ally in the captain of the Prophet, who tutors them in the mysteries of Bada—a nation of subhumans ruled by the gigantic rat Harat. And in the exquisite Widow Han, keeper of the secrets of Singapore, they find an ally and more, as her exotic charms threaten to undo even the inscrutable sleuth's defenses against the fair sex. "A rollicking adventure story ... [that] puts a superb spin on the intellectual byplay between Holmes and Watson.... Splendidly written homage."—Chicago Sun-Times</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Battle-Hardened: An Infantry Officer's Harrowing Journey from D-Day to VE-Day&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of an American soldier's growth from a 2nd Lieutenant eager to prove his worth in battle to a skilled and resolute commander over the course of the Northern European Campaign. Craig Chapman delves deep into the personal recollections and mental state of Bill Champman as he fought against the Nazis, enduring frontline combat and witnessing horror on a massive scale. Lieutenant Chapman maintains his sanity by isolating his emotions from the chaos of the battlefield, and the young officer turns into a hard-edged warrior who dispassionately orders men to risk their lives yet still manages to hold onto his humanity.</description>

  <description>Celebrated author Laurie R. King dazzles mystery lovers once again in this, her second Kate Martinelli mystery. The story unfolds as a band of homeless people cremate a beloved dog in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. When it comes to incidents like this, the authorities are willing to overlook a few broken regulations. But three weeks later, after the dog's owner gets the same fiery send-off, the SFPD knows it has a serious problem on its hands. Other than the fact that they're dealing with a particularly grisly homicide, Inspector Kate Martinelli and her partner, Al Hawkin, have little else to go on. They have a homeless victim without a positive ID, a group of witnesses who have little love for the cops, and a possible suspect, known only as Brother Erasmus. Kate learns that Erasmus is well-acquainted with the park's homeless and with the rarefied atmosphere of Berkeley's Graduate Theological Union, yet he remains an enigma to all. It's apparent that he is by no means crazy—but he is a fool.  Kate begins the frustrating task of interrogating a man who communicates only through quotations. Trying to learn something of his history leads her along a twisting road to a disbanded cult, long-buried secrets, the thirst for spirituality, and the hunger for bloody vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In this thrilling new crime novel that ingeniously bridges Laurie R. King's Edgar and Creasey Awards--winning Kate Martinelli series and her bestselling series starring Mary Russell, San Francisco homicide detective Kate Martinelli crosses paths with Sherlock Holmes-in a spellbinding dual mystery that could come only from the "intelligent, witty, and complex" mind of "New York Times" bestselling author Laurie R. King.... &lt;br /&gt;Kate Martinelli has seen her share of peculiar things as a San Francisco cop, but never anything quite like this: an ornate Victorian sitting room straight out of a Sherlock Holmes story-complete with violin, tobacco-filled Persian slipper, and gunshots in the wallpaper that spell out the initials of the late queen. &lt;br /&gt;Philip Gilbert was a true Holmes fanatic, from his antiquated decor to his vintage wardrobe. And no mere fan of fiction's great detective, but a leading expert with a collection of priceless memorabilia-a collection some would kill for. &lt;br /&gt;And perhaps someone did: In his collection is a century-old manuscript purportedly written by Holmes himself-a manuscript that eerily echoes details of Gilbert's own murder. &lt;br /&gt;Now, with the help of her partner, Al Hawkin, Kate must follow the convoluted trail of a killer-one who may have trained at the feet of the greatest mind of all times.</description>

  <description>This gripping debut of the Kate Martinelli mystery series won the Edgar Awardfor Best First Mystery, generating wide critical acclaim and moving Laurie R.King into the upper tier of the genre. As "A Grave Talent" begins, The unthinkable has happened in a small community outside of San Francisco. A string of shocking murders has occurred, each victim an innocent child. For Detective Kate Martinelli, just promoted to Homicide and paired with a seasoned cop who's less than thrilled to be handed a green partner, it's going to be a difficult case. Then the detectives receive what appears to be a case-breaking lead: it seems that one of the residents of this odd, close-knit colony is Vaun Adams, arguably the century's greatest painter of women, a man, as it turns out, with a sinister secret. For behind the brushes and canvases also stands a notorious felon once convicted of strangling a little girl. What really happened on that day of savage violence eighteen years ago? To bring a murderer to justice, Kate must delve into the artist's dark past -- even if she knows it means losing everything she holds dear.</description>

  <description>Mary Russell is used to dark secrets—her own, and those of her famous partner and husband, Sherlock Holmes. Trust is a thing slowly given, but over the course of a decade together, the two have forged an indissoluble bond.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And what of the other person to whom Mary Russell has opened her heart: the couple’s longtime housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson? Russell’s faith and affection are suddenly shattered when a man arrives on the doorstep claiming to be Mrs. Hudson’s son.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Samuel Hudson tells Russell cannot possibly be true, yet she believes him—as surely as she believes the threat of the gun in his hand. In a devastating instant, everything changes. And when the scene is discovered—a pool of blood on the floor, the smell of gunpowder in the air—the most shocking revelation of all is that the grim clues point directly to Clara Hudson.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or rather to Clarissa, the woman she was before Baker Street.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The key to Russell’s sacrifice lies in Mrs. Hudson’s past. To uncover the truth, a frantic Sherlock Holmes must put aside his anguish and push deep into his housekeeper’s secrets—to a time before her disguise was assumed, before her crimes were buried away.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is death here, and murder, and trust betrayed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>For years now, readers of the Russell Memoirs have wondered about the tantalizing mentions of Japan. Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes had spent three weeks there, between India (&lt;i&gt;The Game&lt;/i&gt;) and San Francisco (&lt;i&gt;Locked Rooms&lt;/i&gt;). The time has finally come to tell that story.&lt;br /&gt;It is 1925, and Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes arrive home to find a familiar decorative stone installed in their garden. A stone with a name, which they last saw in the Tokyo garden of the future Emperor of Japan. It is the first indication that the investigation they did for him in 1924 might not be as complete as they had thought. In Japan there were spies, in Oxford there are dreams. In both places there is a small dark-haired woman and danger.</description>

  <description>In England's budding silent-film industry, megalomaniac Randolph Fflytte is king. At the request of Scotland Yard, Mary Russell is dispatched to investigate rumors of criminal activities. At Lisbon rehearsals for "Pirate King", based on Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Pirates of Penzance", thirteen blond-haired, blue-eyed actresses meet the real buccaneers Fflytte has recruited to provide authenticity. But when the crew embarks for Morocco and the actual filming, troubles escalate.</description>

  <description>In Laurie R. King’s latest Mary Russell–Sherlock Holmes mystery, the acclaimed New York Times bestselling author delivers a thriller of ingenious surprises and unrelenting suspense—as the famous husband and wife sleuths are pursued by a killer immune from the sting of justice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It began as a problem in one of Holmes’ beloved beehives, led to a murderous cult, and ended—or so they’d hoped—with a daring escape from a sacrificial altar. Instead, Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, have stirred the wrath and the limitless resources of those they’ve thwarted. Now they are separated and on the run, wanted by the police, and pursued across the Continent by a ruthless enemy with powerful connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unstoppable together, Russell and Holmes will have to survive this time apart, maintaining tenuous contact only by means of coded messages and cryptic notes. With Holmes’ young granddaughter in her safekeeping, Russell will have to call on instincts she didn’t know she had. But has the couple already made a fatal mistake by separating, making themselves easier targets for the shadowy government agents sent to silence them?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From hidden rooms in London shops and rustic forest cabins to rickety planes over Scotland and boats on the frozen North Sea, Russell and Holmes work their way back to each other while uncovering answers to a mystery that will take both of them to solve. A hermit with a mysterious past and a beautiful young female doctor with a secret, a cruelly scarred flyer and an obsessed man of the cloth, Holmes’ brother, Mycroft, and an Intelligence agent who knows too much: Everyone Russell and Holmes meet could either speed their safe reunion or betray them to their enemies—in the most complex, shocking, and deeply personal case of their career.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>A Monstrous Regiment of Women continues Mary Russell's adventures as a worthy student of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and as an ever more skilled sleuth in her own right. Looking for respite in London after a stupefying visit from relatives, Mary encounters a friend from Oxford. The young woman introduces Mary to her current enthusiasm, a strange and enigmatic woman named Margery Childe, who leads something called "The New Temple of God." It seems to be a charismatic sect involved in the post-World War I suffrage movement, with a feminist slant on Christianity. Mary is curious about the woman, and intrigued. Is the New Temple a front for something more sinister? When a series of murders claims members of the movement's wealthy young female volunteers and principal contributors, Mary, with Holmes in the background, begins to investigate. Things become more desperate than either of them expected as Mary's search plunges her into the worst danger she has yet faced.</description>

  <description>Long retired, Sherlock Holmes quietly pursues his study of honeybee behavior on the Sussex Downs. He never imagines he would encounter anyone whose intellect matched his own, much less an audacious teenage girl with a penchant for detection. Miss Mary Russell becomes Holmes's pupil and quickly hones her talent for deduction, disguises and danger. But when an elusive villain enters the picture, their partnership is put to a real test.</description>

  <description>Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>It’s 1996, and Reacher is still in the army. In the morning they give him a medal, and in the afternoon they send him back to school. That night he’s off the grid. Out of sight, out of mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two other men are in the classroom—an FBI agent and a CIA analyst. Each is a first-rate operator, each is fresh off a big win, and each is wondering what the hell they are doing there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then they find out: A Jihadist sleeper cell in Hamburg, Germany, has received an unexpected visitor—a Saudi courier, seeking safe haven while waiting to rendezvous with persons unknown. A CIA asset, undercover inside the cell, has overheard the courier whisper a chilling message: “The American wants a hundred million dollars.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For what? And who from? Reacher and his two new friends are told to find the American. Reacher recruits the best soldier he has ever worked with: Sergeant Frances Neagley. Their mission heats up in more ways than one, while always keeping their eyes on the prize: If they don’t get their man, the world will suffer an epic act of terrorism.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Langley to Hamburg, Jalalabad to Kiev, &lt;i&gt;Night School&lt;/i&gt; moves like a bullet through a treacherous landscape of double crosses, faked identities, and new and terrible enemies, as Reacher maneuvers inside the game and outside the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 13 hours and 7 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Two lonely towns in Colorado: Hope and Despair. Between them, twelve miles of empty road. Jack Reacher never turns back. It's not in his nature. All he wants is a cup of coffee. What he gets is big trouble. So in Lee Child’s electrifying new novel, Reacher—a man with no fear, no illusions, and nothing to lose—goes to war against a town that not only wants him gone, it wants him dead.&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the welcome Reacher expected. He was just passing through, minding his own business. But within minutes of his arrival a deputy is in the hospital and Reacher is back in Hope, setting up a base of operations against Despair, where a huge, seething walled-off industrial site does something nobody is supposed to see . . . where a small plane takes off every night and returns seven hours later . . . where a garrison of well-trained and well-armed military cops—the kind of soldiers Reacher once commanded—waits and watches . . . where above all two young men have disappeared and two frightened young women wait and hope for their return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining forces with a beautiful cop who runs Hope with a cool hand, Reacher goes up against Despair—against the deputies who try to break him and the rich man who tries to scare him—and starts to crack open the secrets, starts to expose the terrifying connection to a distant war that’s killing Americans by the thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, between a town and the man who owns it, between Reacher and his conscience, something has to give. And Reacher never gives an inch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Jack Reacher Novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Why is this town called Mother’s Rest?”&lt;/i&gt; That’s all Reacher wants to know. But no one will tell him. It’s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there’s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long he’s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the way—right back to where he started, in Mother’s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Walking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacher’s rule is: If you want me to stop, you’re going to have to make me.</description>

  <description>After an epic and interrupted journey all the way from the snows of South Dakota, Jack Reacher has finally made it to Virginia. His destination: a sturdy stone building a short bus ride from Washington D.C., the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. It was the closest thing to a home he ever had.&lt;p&gt;Why? He wants to meet the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner. He liked her voice on the phone. But the officer sitting behind Reacher’s old desk isn't a woman. Why is Susan Turner not there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Reacher doesn’t expect is what comes next. He himself is in big trouble, accused of a sixteen-year-old homicide. And he certainly doesn't expect to hear these words: ‘You’re back in the army, Major. And your ass is mine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will he be sorry he went back? Or – will someone else?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, ex–military cop Reacher sees more than most people would...and because of that, he’s thrust into an explosive situation that’s about to blow up in his face. For the only way to find the truth—and save two innocent lives—is to do it the way Jack Reacher does it best: the hard way….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Reacher was alone, the way he liked it, soaking up the hot, electric New York City night, watching a man cross the street to a parked Mercedes and drive it away. The car contained one million dollars in ransom money. And Edward Lane, the man who paid it, will pay even more to get his family back. Lane runs a highly illegal soldiers-for-hire operation. He will use any amount of money and any tool to find his beautiful wife and child. And then he’ll turn Jack Reacher loose with a vengeance—because Reacher is the best man hunter in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the trail of a vicious kidnapper, Reacher is learning the chilling secrets of his employer’s past…and of a horrific drama in the heart of a nasty little war. He’s beginning to realize that Edward Lane is hiding something. Something dirty. Something big. But Reacher also knows this: he’s already in way too deep to stop now.</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate loner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he's moved from place to place...without family...without possessions...without commitments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And without fear. Which is good, because trouble--big, violent, complicated trouble--finds Reacher wherever he goes. And when trouble finds him, Reacher does not quit, not once...not ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some unfinished business has now found Reacher. And Reacher is a man who hates unfinished business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, a key investigation went sour and someone got away with murder. Now a chance encounter brings it all back. Now Reacher sees his one last shot. Some would call it vengeance. Some would call it redemption. Reacher would call it...justice.</description>

  <description>Hitching rides is an unreliable mode of transport. In temperatures of over a hundred degrees, you’re lucky if a driver will open the door of his air-conditioned car long enough to let you slide in. That’s Jack Reacher’s conclusion. He’s adrift in the fearsome heat of a Texas summer, and he needs to keep moving through the wide open vastness, like a shark in the water. The last thing he’s worried about is exactly who picks him up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never expected it to be somebody like Carmen. She’s alone, driving a Cadillac. She’s beautiful, young and rich. She has a little girl who is being watched by unseen observers. And a husband who is in jail. Who will beat her senseless when he comes out. If he doesn’t kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reacher is no stranger to trouble. And at Carmen’s remote ranch in Echo County there is plenty of it: lies and prejudice, hatred and murder. Reacher can never resist a lady in distress. Her family is hostile. The cops can’t be trusted. The lawyers won’t help. If Reacher can’t set things straight, who can?</description>

  <description>From a helicopter high above the empty California desert, a man is sent free-falling into the night…. In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite team of ex–army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher—soldier, cop, hero—is pulled out of his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From the first shocking scenes in Lee Child’s explosive new novel, Jack Reacher is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old friends…and is on its way to something even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his back—no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story—about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day. The deeper they dig, the more they don’ t know: about two other comrades who have suddenly gone missing—and a trail that leads into the neon of Vegas and the darkness of international terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, Reacher can only react. To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life—and take this thing all the way to the end. Because in a world of bad luck and trouble, when someone targets Jack Reacher and his team, they’d better be ready for what comes right back at them…</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher is back. &lt;br /&gt;The countdown has begun. Get ready for the most exciting 61 hours of your life. #1 "New York Times" bestselling author Lee Child's latest thriller is a ticking time bomb of suspense that builds electric tension on every page. &lt;br /&gt;Sixty-one hours. Not a minute to spare. &lt;br /&gt;A tour bus crashes in a savage snowstorm and lands Jack Reacher in the middle of a deadly confrontation. In nearby Bolton, South Dakota, one brave woman is standing up for justice in a small town threatened by sinister forces. If she's going to live long enough to testify, she'll need help. Because a killer is coming to Bolton, a coldly proficient assassin who never misses. &lt;br /&gt;Reacher's original plan was to keep on moving. But the next 61 hours will change everything. The secrets are deadlier and his enemies are stronger than he could have guessed--but so is the woman whose life he'll risk his own to save. &lt;br /&gt;In 61 Hours, Lee Child has written a showdown thriller with an explosive ending that readers will talk about for a long time to come.</description>

  <description>March 1997. A woman has her throat cut behind a bar in Carter Crossing, Mississippi. Just down the road is a big army base. Is the murderer a local guy - or is he a soldier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Reacher, still a major in the military police, is sent in undercover. The county sheriff is a former US Marine - and a stunningly beautiful woman. Her investigation is going nowhere. Is the Pentagon stonewalling her? Or doesn't she really want to find the killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The adrenaline-pumping, high-voltage action in &lt;i&gt;The Affair&lt;/i&gt; is set just six months before the opening of &lt;i&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/i&gt;, and it marks a turning point in Reacher's career. If he does what the army wants, will he be able to live with himself? And if he doesn't, will the army be able to live with him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this his last case in uniform?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Compulsively readable.”—&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Don’t pick up [this] Jack Reacher novel if you don’t have some time on your hands, because &lt;i&gt;Worth Dying For &lt;/i&gt;is difficult to put down. . . . Child manages to get an amazing amount of suspense into the novel.”—Associated Press&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Lee Child's &lt;i&gt;The Affair.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A model of suspenseful storytelling and an outstanding addition to a series that stands in the front rank of modern thrillers.”—&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Still the thinking man’s action hero, supreme butt-kicker and smartest guy in the room.”—&lt;i&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“This series is about as good as pop fiction gets.”—&lt;i&gt;The Miami Herald&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Skilled, cautious, and anonymous, Jack Reacher is perfect for the job: to assassinate the vice president of the United States. Theoretically, of course. A female Secret Service agent wants Reacher to find the holes in her system, and fast - because a covert group already has the vice president in their sights. They've planned well. There's just one thing they didn't plan on: Reacher.</description>

  <description>Suicide bombers are easy to spot. They give out all kinds of tell-tale signs. Mostly because they're nervous. By definition they're all first-timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are twelve things to look for: No one who has worked in law enforcement will ever forget them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City. The subway, two o'clock in the morning. Jack Reacher studies his fellow passengers. Four are OK. The fifth isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The train brakes for Grand Central Station. Will Reacher intervene, and save lives? Or is he wrong? Will his intervention cost lives - including his own?</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28695879-die-trying" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a Chicago suburb, a dentist is met in his office parking lot by three men and ordered into the trunk of his Lexus. On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a burning match. The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting to kill.</description>

  <description>Six shots. Five dead. One heartland city thrown into a state of terror. But within hours the cops have it solved: a slam-dunk case. Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, from the world he lives in—no phone, no address, no commitments–ex–military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, Reacher’s arrival will change everything—about a case that isn’t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot–and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away–point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr’s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings. And for Reacher, the only way to take him down is to know his ruthlessness and respect his cunning–and then match him shot for shot…</description>

  <description>The road in front of Dr. Louis Creed's rural Maine home frequently claims the lives of neighborhood pets. Louis has recently moved from Chicago to Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their children and pet cat. Near their house, local children have created a cemetery for the dogs and cats killed by the steady stream of transports on the busy highway. Deeper in the woods lies another graveyard, an ancient Indian burial ground whose sinister properties Louis discovers when the family cat is killed.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>Welcome to Derry, Maine ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But none of them can withstand the force that has drawn them back to Derry to face the nightmare without an end, and the evil without a name.</description>

  <description>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death. And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen.</description>

  <description>Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Destined to become a classic" (Iris Chang, author of &lt;i&gt;The Rape of Nanking&lt;/i&gt;), this harrowing memoir of life inside North Korea was the first account to emerge from the notoriously secretive country -- and it remains one of the most terrifying.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Amid escalating nuclear tensions, Kim Jong-un and North Korea's other leaders have kept a tight grasp on their one-party state, quashing any nascent opposition movements and sending all suspected dissidents to its brutal concentration camps for "re-education."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kang Chol-Hwan is the first survivor of one of these camps to escape and tell his story to the world, documenting the extreme conditions in these gulags and providing a personal insight into life in North Korea. Sent to the notorious labor camp Yodok when he was nine years old, Kang observed frequent public executions and endured forced labor and near-starvation rations for ten years. In 1992, he escaped to South Korea, where he found God and now advocates for human rights in North Korea.&lt;br /&gt;Part horror story, part historical document, part memoir, part political tract, this book brings together unassailable firsthand experience, setting one young man's personal suffering in the wider context of modern history, giving eyewitness proof to the abuses perpetrated by the North Korean regime.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Repairman Jack isn't your average appliance repairman--he fixes &lt;i&gt;situations&lt;/i&gt; for people, often risking his own life. Jack has no last name, no social security number, works only for cash, and has no qualms when it comes to seeing that the job gets done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Alicia Clayton, a pediatrician who treats children with AIDS, is full of secrets, and she has just inherited a house that holds another. Haunted by painful memories, Alicia wants the house destroyed--but somehow everyone she enlists to help ends up violently killed. The house holds a powerful secret, and Alicia's charmless brother Thomas seems willing to do anything to get his hands on that secret himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not if Repairman Jack can find it first!</description>

  <description>Just days before a massive exhibition opens at the popular New York Museum of Natural History, visitors are being savagely murdered in the museum's dark hallways and secret rooms. Autopsies indicate that the killer cannot be human...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the museum's directors plan to go ahead with a big bash to celebrate the new exhibition, in spite of the murders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum researcher Margo Green must find out who-or what-is doing the killing. But can she do it in time to stop the massacre?</description>

  <description>As any herpetologist will tell you, the fer-de-lance is among the most dreaded snakes known to man. When someone makes a present of one to Nero Wolfe, Archie Goodwin knows he's getting dreadfully close to solving the devilishly clever murders of an immigrant and a college president. As for Wolfe, he's playing snake charmer in a case with more twists than an anaconda -- whistling a seductive tune he hopes will catch a killer who's still got poison in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>Down-and-out drunk Terry Lennox has a problem: his millionaire wife is dead and he needs to get out of LA fast. So he turns to the only friend he can trust: private investigator Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is willing to help a man down on his luck, but later Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn nasty. Marlowe is drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his wife, but how many stiffs will turn up before he gets to the truth?</description>

  <description>"The dead don't talk. I don't know why." But they do try to communicate, with a short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, Stormy Llewellyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he has a gift, maybe it's a curse, Odd has never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out. Sometimes they want justice, and Odd's otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one. But this time it's different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite, a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants, not even Odd's deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is August 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe. As evil coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll. His account of two shattering days when past and present, fate and destiny converge is the stuff of our worst nightmares, and a testament by which to live: sanely if not safely, with courage, humor, and a full heart that even in the darkness must persevere.</description>

  <description>In a case that will push their relationship to the breaking point, Mary Russell must help reverse the greatest failure of her legendary husband's storied past--a painful and personal defeat that still has the power to sting...this time fatally. &lt;br /&gt;For Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, returning to the Sussex coast after seven months abroad was especially sweet. There was even a mystery to solve--the unexplained disappearance of an entire colony of bees from one of Holmes's beloved hives. &lt;br /&gt;But the anticipated sweetness of their homecoming is quickly tempered by a galling memory from her husband's past. Mary had met Damian Adler only once before, when the promising surrealist painter had been charged with--and exonerated from--murder. Now the talented and troubled young man was enlisting their help again, this time in a desperate search for his missing wife and child. &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to communal behavior, Russell has often observed that there are many kinds of madness. And before this case yields its shattering solution, she'll come into dangerous contact with a fair number of them. From suicides at Stonehenge to a bizarre religious cult, from the demimonde of the Cafe Royal at the heart of Bohemian London to the dark secrets of a young woman's past on the streets of Shanghai, Russell will find herself on the trail of a killer more dangerous than any she's ever faced--a killer Sherlock Holmes himself may be protecting for reasons near and dear to his heart.</description>

  <description>It’s only the second day of 1924, but Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, find themselves embroiled in intrigue. It starts with a New Year’s visit from Holmes’s brother Mycroft, who comes bearing a strange package containing the papers of an English spy named Kimball O’Hara—the same Kimball known to the world through Kipling’s famed &lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt;. Inexplicably, O’Hara withdrew from the “Great Game” of espionage and now he has just as inexplicably disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Russell discovers Holmes’s own secret friendship with the spy, she knows the die is cast: she will accompany her husband to India to search for the missing operative. But Russell soon learns that in this faraway and exotic land, it’s often impossible to tell friend from foe—and that some games aren’t played for fun but for the highest stakes of all…life and death.</description>

  <description>Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are back in Laurie R. King's highly acclaimed New York Times bestselling mystery series. And this time the first couple of detection pair up to unlock the buried memory of a shocking crime with the power to kill again-lost somewhere in Russell's own past. &lt;br /&gt;After departing Bombay by ship, Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are en route to the bustling modern city of San Francisco. There, Mary will settle some legal affairs surrounding the inheritance of her family's old estate. But the closer they get to port, the more Mary finds herself prey to troubling dreams and irrational behavior-a point not lost on Holmes, much to Russell's annoyance. &lt;br /&gt;In 1906, when Mary was six, San Francisco was devastated by an earthquake and a raging fire that reduced the city to rubble. For years, Mary has denied any memory of the catastrophe that for days turned the fabled streets into hell on earth. But Holmes suspects that some hidden trauma connected with the "unforgettable" catastrophe may be the real culprit responsible for Mary's memory lapse. And no sooner do they begin to familiarize themselves with the particulars of the Russell estate than it becomes apparent that whatever unpleasantness Mary has forgotten, it hasn't forgotten her. Why does her father's will forbid access to the house except in the presence of immediate family? Why did someone break in, then take nothing of any value? And why is Russell herself targeted for assassination? &lt;br /&gt;The more questions they ask of Mary's past, the more people from that past turn out to have died violent, unexplained deaths. Now, with the aid of a hard-boiled young detective and crime writer named Hammett, Russell and Holmes find themselves embroiled in a mystery that leads them through the winding streets of Chinatown to the unspoken secrets of a parent's marriage and the tragic car "accident" that a fourteen-year-old Mary alone survived-an accident that may not have been an accident at all. What Russell is about to discover is that even a forgotten past never dies...and it can kill again.</description>

  <description>Narcotics office Cal Moore's orders were to look into the city's latest drug killing. Instead, he ends up in a motel room with a fatal bullet wound to the head and a suicide note stuffed in his back pocket.&lt;p&gt;Working the case, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is reminded of the primal police rule he learned long ago: don't look for the facts, but the glue that holds them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Harry's making some very dangerous connections, starting with a dead cop and leading to a bloody string of murders that wind from Hollywood Boulevard to the back alleys south of the border. Now this battle-scarred veteran will find himself in the centre of a complex and deadly game - one in which he may be the next and likeliest victim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Hours after Holmes and Russell return from solving the murky riddle of The Moor, a bloodied but oddly familiar stranger pounds desperately on their front door, pleading for their help. When he recovers, he lays before them the story of the enigmatic Marsh Hughenfort, younger brother of the Duke of Beauville, returned to England upon his brother's death, determined to learn the truth about the untimely death of the hall's expected heir - a puzzle he is convinced only Holmes and Russell can solve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a mystery that begins during the Great War of 1918, when young Gabriel Hughenfort, the late Duke's only son, died amidst scandalous rumors that have haunted the family ever since. While Holmes heads to London to uncover the truth of Gabriel's war record, Russell joins an ill-fated shooting party. A missing diary, a purloined bundle of letters, and a trail of ominous clues comprise a mystery that will call for Holmes's cleverest disguises and Russell's most daring journeys into the unknown! from an English hamlet to the city of Paris to the wild prairie of the New World. The trap is set, the game is afoot, but can they catch an elusive villain in the act of murder before they become his next victims?</description>

  <description>Lord Peter Wimsey bent down over General Fentiman and drew the Morning Post gently away from the gnarled old hands. Then, with a quick jerk, he lifted the quiet figure. It came up all of a piece, stiff as a wooden doll . . .&lt;br /&gt;But how did the general die? Who was the mysterious Mr X who fled when he was wanted for questioning? And which of the general's heirs, both members of the Bellona Club, is lying?</description>

  <description>With her bestselling mystery series featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell, Laurie R. King has created "lively adventure in the very best of intellectual company," according to &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review.&lt;/i&gt; Now the author of &lt;b&gt;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;The Moor&lt;/b&gt;--the first writer since Patricia Cornwell to win both the American Edgar and British Creasey Awards for a debut novel (&lt;b&gt;A Grave Talent&lt;/b&gt;)--unfolds a hitherto unknown chapter in the history of Russell's apprenticeship to the great detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the close of the year 1918, forced to flee England's green and pleasant land, Russell and Holmes enter British-occupied Palestine under the auspices of Holmes' enigmatic brother, Mycroft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Gentlemen, we are at your service." Thus Holmes greets the two travel-grimed Arab figures who receive them in the orange groves fringing the Holy Land. Whatever role could the volatile Ali and the taciturn Mahmoud play in Mycroft's design for this land the British so recently wrested from the Turks? After passing a series of tests, Holmes and Russell learn their guides are engaged in a mission for His Majesty's Government, and disguise themselves as Bedouins--Russell as the beardless youth "Amir"--to join them in a stealthy reconnaissance through the dusty countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent rash of murders seems unrelated to the growing tensions between Jew, Moslem, and Christian, yet Holmes is adamant that he must reconstruct the most recent one in the desert gully where it occurred. His singular findings will lead him and Russell through labyrinthine bazaars, verminous inns, cliff-hung monasteries--and into mortal danger. When her mentor's inquiries jeopardize his life, Russell fearlessly wields a pistol and even assays the arts of seduction to save him. Bruised and bloodied, the pair ascend to the jewellike city of Jerusalem, where they will at last meet their adversary, whose lust for savagery and power could reduce the city's most ancient and sacred place to rubble and ignite this tinderbox of a land....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classically Holmesian yet enchantingly fresh, sinuously plotted, with colorful characters and a dazzling historic ambience, &lt;b&gt;O Jerusalem&lt;/b&gt; sweeps readers ever onward in the thrill of the chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Lincoln Rhyme was once a brilliant criminologist, a genius in the field of forensics -- until an accident left him physically and emotionally shattered. But now a diabolical killer is challenging Rhyme to a terrifying and ingenious duel of wits. With police detective Amelia Sachs by his side, Rhyme must follow a labyrinth of clues that reaches back to a dark chapter in New York City's past -- and reach further into the darkness of the mind of a madman who won't stop until he has stripped life down to the bone.</description>

  <description>Lord Peter Wimsey and his bride, mystery writer Harriet Vane, start their honeymoon with murder. The former owner of Talboys estate is dead in the cellar with a misspelled "notise" to the milkman, not a spot of blood on his smashed skull, and £600 in his pocket.</description>

  <description>In the eerie wasteland of Dartmoor, Sherlock Holmes summons his devoted wife and partner, Mary Russell, from her studies at Oxford to aid the investigation of a death and some disturbing phenomena of a decidedly supernatural origin. Through the mists of the moor there have been sightings of a spectral coach made of bones carrying a woman long-ago accused of murdering her husband--and of a hound with a single glowing eye. Returning to the scene of one of his most celebrated cases, &lt;i&gt;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&lt;/i&gt; Holmes and Russell investigate a mystery darker and more unforgiving than the moors themselves.</description>

  <description>When ad man Victor Dean falls down the stairs in the offices of Pym's Publicity, a respectable London advertising agency, it looks like an accident. Then Lord Peter Wimsey is called in, and he soon discovers there's more to copywriting than meets the eye. A bit of cocaine, a hint of blackmail, and some wanton women can be read between the lines. And then there is the brutal succession of murders -- 5 of them -- each one a fixed fee for advertising a deadly secret.</description>

  <description>On the right side of the law. Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian Rudd is not your typical street lawyer. He works out of a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, fine leather chairs, a hidden gun compartment, and a heavily armed driver. He has no firm, no partners, no associates, and only one employee, his driver, who’s also his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddy. He lives alone in a small but extremely safe penthouse apartment, and his primary piece of furniture is a vintage pool table. He drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian defends people other lawyers won’t go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult, who is accused of molesting and murdering two little girls; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house.  Why these clients? Because he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, even if he, Sebastian, has to cheat to secure one. He hates injustice, doesn’t like insurance companies, banks, or big corporations; he distrusts all levels of government and laughs at the justice system’s notions of ethical behavior.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian Rudd is one of John Grisham’s most colorful, outrageous, and vividly drawn characters yet. Gritty, witty, and impossible to put down, &lt;i&gt;Rogue Lawyer &lt;/i&gt;showcases the master of the legal thriller at his very best.</description>

  <description>We expect our judges to be honest and wise. Their integrity and impartiality are the bedrock of the entire judicial system. We trust them to ensure fair trials, to protect the rights of all litigants, to punish those who do wrong, and to oversee the orderly and efficient flow of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when a judge bends the law or takes a bribe? It’s rare, but it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacy Stoltz is an investigator for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct. She is a lawyer, not a cop, and it is her job to respond to complaints dealing with judicial misconduct. After nine years with the Board, she knows that most problems are caused by incompetence, not corruption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a corruption case eventually crosses her desk. A previously disbarred lawyer is back in business with a new identity. He now goes by the name Greg Myers, and he claims to know of a Florida judge who has stolen more money than all other crooked judges combined. And not just crooked judges in Florida. All judges, from all states, and throughout U.S. history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s the source of the ill-gotten gains? It seems the judge was secretly involved with the construction of a large casino on Native American land. The Coast Mafia financed the casino and is now helping itself to a sizable skim of each month’s cash. The judge is getting a cut and looking the other way. It’s a sweet deal: Everyone is making money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now Greg wants to put a stop to it. His only client is a person who knows the truth and wants to blow the whistle and collect millions under Florida law. Greg files a complaint with the Board on Judicial Conduct, and the case is assigned to Lacy Stoltz, who immediately suspects that this one could be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous is one thing. Deadly is something else.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;John Grisham has a &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;ew hero . . . and she’s full of surprises&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The year is 2008 and Samantha Kofer’s career at a huge Wall Street law firm is on the fast track—until the recession hits and she gets downsized, furloughed, escorted out of the building. Samantha, though, is one of the “lucky” associates. She’s offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, after which there would be a slim chance that she’d get her old job back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Mattie Wyatt, lifelong Brady resident and head of the town’s legal aid clinic, is there to teach her how to “help real people with real problems.” For the first time in her career, Samantha prepares a lawsuit, sees the inside of an actual courtroom, gets scolded by a judge, and receives threats from locals who aren’t so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town. And she learns that Brady, like most small towns, harbors some big secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her new job takes Samantha into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, rules are ignored, regulations are flouted, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack from Big Coal. Violence is always just around the corner, and within weeks Samantha finds herself engulfed in litigation that turns deadly.</description>

  <description>The office of the public defender is not known as a training ground for bright young litigators. Clay Carter has been there too long and, like most of his colleagues, dreams of a better job in a real firm. When he reluctantly takes the case of a young man charged with a random street killing, he assumes it is just another of the many senseless murders that hit D.C. every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he digs into the background of his client, Clay stumbles on a conspiracy too horrible to believe. He suddenly finds himself in the middle of a complex case against one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, looking at the kind of enormous settlement that would totally change his life--that would make him, almost overnight, the legal profession's newest king of torts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Trumble is a minimum-security federal prison, a "camp," home to the usual assortment of relatively harmless criminals--drug dealers, bank robbers, swindlers, embezzlers, tax evaders, two Wall Street crooks, one doctor, at least five lawyers.&lt;p&gt;And three former judges who call themselves the Brethren: one from Texas, one from California, and one from Mississippi. They meet each day in the law library, their turf at Trumble, where they write briefs, handle cases for other inmates, practice law without a license, and sometimes dispense jailhouse justice. And they spend hours writing letters. They are fine-tuning a mail scam, and it's starting to really work. The money is pouring in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then their little scam goes awry. It ensnares the wrong victim, a powerful man on the outside, a man with dangerous friends, and the Brethren's days of quietly marking time are over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Michael was in a hurry. He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake &amp;amp; Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake &amp;amp; Sweeney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fast track derailed; the ladder collapsed. Michael bolted the firm and took a top-secret file with him. He landed in the streets, an advocate for the homeless, a street lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a thief.</description>

  <description>John Grisham's five novels -- &lt;i&gt;A Time To Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Chamber&lt;/i&gt; -- have been number one best-sellers, and have a combined total of 47 million copies in print. Now, in&lt;i&gt;The Rainmaker&lt;/i&gt;, Grisham returns to the courtroom for the first time since &lt;i&gt;A Time To Kill&lt;/i&gt;, and weaves a riveting tale of legal intrigue and corporate greed. Combining suspense, narrative momentum, and humor as only John Grisham can, this is another spellbinding read from the most popular author of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grisham's sixth spellbinding novel of legal intrigue and corporate greed displays all of the intricate plotting, fast-paced action, humor, and suspense that have made him the most popular author of our time. In his first courtroom thriller since A &lt;i&gt;Time To Kill&lt;/i&gt;, John Grisham tells the story of a young man barely out of law school who finds himself taking on one of the most powerful, corrupt, and ruthless companies in America -- and exposing a complex, multibillion-dollar insurance scam. In hs final semester of law school Rudy Baylor is required to provide free legal advice to a group of senior citizens, and it is there that he meets his first "clients," Dot and Buddy Black. Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company, and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen -- and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation. The problem is, Rudy's flat broke, has no job, hasn't even passed the bar, and is about to go head-to-head with one of the best defense attorneys -- and powerful industries -- in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Every jury has a leader, and the verdict belongs to him. In Biloxi, Mississippi, a landmark tobacco trial with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake begins routinely, then swerves mysteriously off course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is behaving strangely, and at least one juror is convinced he's being watched. Soon they have to be sequestered. Then a tip from an anonymous young woman suggests she is able to predict the jurors' increasingly odd behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the jury somehow being manipulated, or even controlled? If so, by whom? And, more importantly, why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In suburban Georgetown a killer's Reeboks whisper on the front floor of a posh home... In a seedy D.C. porno house a patron is swiftly garroted to death... The next day America learns that two of its Supreme Court justices have been assassinated. And in New Orleans, a young law student prepares a legal brief... To Darby Shaw it was no more than a legal shot in the dark, a brilliant guess. To the Washington establishment it was political dynamite. Suddenly Darby is witness to a murder -- a murder intended for her. Going underground, she finds there is only one person she can trust -- an ambitious reporter after a newsbreak hotter than Watergate -- to help her piece together the deadly puzzle. Somewhere between the bayous of  Louisiana and the White House's inner sanctums, a violent cover-up is being engineered. For someone has read Darby's brief. Someone who will stop at nothing to destroy the evidence of an unthinkable crime.</description>

  <description>In a weedy lot on the outskirts of Memphis, two boys watch a shiny Lincoln pull up to the curb...Eleven-year-old Mark Sway and his younger brother were sharing a forbidden cigarette when a chance encounter with a suicidal lawyer left Mark knowing a bloody and explosive secret: the whereabouts of the most sought-after dead body in America. Now Mark is caught between a legal system gone mad and a mob killer desperate to cover up his crime. And his only ally is a woman named Reggie Love, who has been a lawyer for all of four years. Prosecutors are willing to break all the rules to make Mark talk. The mob will stop at nothing to keep him quiet. And Reggie will do anything to protect her client --even take a last, desperate gamble that could win Mark his freedom... or cost them both their lives.</description>

  <description>Before &lt;i&gt;The Firm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Pelican Brief&lt;/i&gt; made him a superstar, John Grisham wrote this riveting story of retribution and justice -- at last it's available in a Doubleday hardcover edition. In this searing courtroom drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the savage depths of racial violence...as he delivers a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small southern town...Clanton, Mississippi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes matters into his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten days, as burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life...and then his own.</description>

  <description>The team of Koko, the brilliant Siamese cat, and Qwilleran, the reporter with the perceptive moustache, is back in action -- with an adorable female Siamese, Yum Yum, added to the household.When Qwilleran decides to do a feature series on Junktown, he gets more than he bargained for. Not the dope den he anticipated, Junktown is a haven for antique dealers and collectors -- as strange a lot as the crafty reporter has ever encountered. When a mysterious fall ends the career -- and the life -- of one of Junktown's leading citizens, Qwilleran is convinced it was no accident. But, as usual, it takes Koko to prove he's right.</description>

But from the moment he arrives, things turn strange. Eerie footsteps cross the roof at midnight. Local townsfolk become oddly secretive. And then while fishing, Qwilleran hooks onto a murder mystery.

  <description>Jim Qwilleran is not exactly overwhelmed by his new assignment for the Daily Fluxion. Interior design has never been one of his specialties and now he's supposed to turn out an entire magazine on the subject every week! But the first issue of Gracious Abodes is barely off the presses when Qwilleran finds himself back on more familiar territory -- the exclusive residence featured on the cover has been burglarized and the lady of the house found dead...now Qwilleran and Koko -- the brilliant Siamese -- have their respective moustache and whiskers twitching, and when Koko starts pawing clues in the dictionary and sniffing designer furniture, Qwilleran finds himself doing a feature on a very clever murder.</description>

But when his old girlfriend disappears, something has to be done. Qwilleran, Koko and Yum Yum set out to solve the mystery--and find a murderer!</description>

  <description>Jim Qwilleran is a prizewinning reporter who's been on the skids but is now coming back with a job as feature writer (mostly on the art scene) for the Daily Fluxion. George Bonifield Mountclemens, the paper's credentialed art critic, writes almost invariably scathing, hurtful reviews of local shows; delivers his pieces by messenger; lives with his all-knowing cat Koko in a lushly furnished house in a moldering neighborhood, and has a raft of enemies all over town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He offers the newcomer a tiny apartment in his building at a nominal rent, and Qwilleran grabs it, surmising the deal will involve lots of cat-sitting. Meanwhile, a gallery whose artists get happier treatment from Mountclemens is owned by Earl Lambreth. The acerbic critic has praised paintings there by a reclusive Italian named Scrano; the junk assemblages of Nino, who calls himself a ``Thingist,'' as well as works by Lambreth's attractive wife Zoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Zoe who, one night past closing, finds her husband stabbed to death in the vandalized gallery. Days later, Qwilleran, guided by an insistent Koko, finds Mountclemens's knifed corpse on the patio behind his house.</description>

  <description>The wealthy Agatha Dawson is dead--a trifle sooner than expected--but there are no apparent signs of foul play. Lord Peter Wimsey, however, senses that something is amiss and refuses to let the case rest--even without any clues or leads. Suddenly, he is faced with another murder: Agatha's maid. Can super-sleuth Wimsey find the murderer and solve the case before he becomes the killer's next victim?The intricate trail of horror and senseless murder leads from a beautiful Hampshire village to a fashionable London flat and a deliberate test of amour.</description>

  <description>After months of menacing phone calls and feeling that her every move is being watched, successful writer Beryl Madison flees Key West when a terrifying message is scratched on her car. But the very night she returns to Richmond, she deactivates her burglar alarm and opens her door to someone who nearly decapitates her. Why did she let him in, wonders Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta? And, why is Beryl's latest manuscript missing? Persuing the answers involves Scarpetta in the murder of another writer - Beryl's jealous mentor. While she copes with a variety of personal and professional problems, Scarpetta's high-tech forensic skills enable her to collect a body of evidence - clues that would mean little without her intelligence, compassion, and imagination - that leads her directly into a nightmare all her own.</description>

  <description>Rustic old Riddlesdale Lodge was a Wimsey family retreat filled with country pleasures and the thrill of the hunt -- until the game turned up human and quite dead. He lay among the chrysanthemums, wore slippers and a dinner jacket and was Lord Peter's brother-in-law-to-be. His accused murderer was Wimsey's own brother, and if murder set all in the family wasn't enough to boggle the unflappable Lord Wimsey, perhaps a few twists of fate would be -- a mysterious vanishing midnight letter from Egypt...a grieving fiancee with suitcase in hand...and a bullet destined for one very special Wimsey.</description>

  <description>She was a "Jane Doe," an unidentified white female whose decomposed body was discovered near a quarry off California's Highway 1. The case fell to the Santa Teresa County Sheriff's Department, but the detectives had little to go on. The woman was young, her hands were bound with a length of wire, there were multiple stab wounds, and her throat had been slashed. After months of investigation, the murder remained unsolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was eighteen years ago. Now the two men who found the body, both nearing the end of long careers in law enforcement, want one last shot at the case. Old and ill, they need someone to help with their legwork and they turn to Kinsey Millhone. They will, they tell her, find closure if they can just identify the victim. Kinsey is intrigued and agrees to the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But revisiting the past can be a dangerous business, and what begins with the pursuit of Jane Doe's real identity ends in a high-risk hunt for her killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Q" is for Quarry is based on an unsolved homicide that occurred in 1969, and Grafton's interest in the case has generated renewed police efforts. During the past year, the body was exhumed and a nationally known forensic artist did the facial reconstruction that appears in the closing pages of "Q" is for Quarry. Both Grafton and the dedicated members of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department are hoping the photograph will trigger memories that may lead to a positive identification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day Jane Doe was reburied, many officers were at the gravesite. "It's eerie," Grafton writes, "to think about the power this woman still has. Here we are, thirty-three years later, and she still wants to go home."</description>

  <description>Through fourteen books, fans have been fed short rations when it comes to Kinsey Millhone's past: a morsel here, a dollop there. We know of the aunt who raised her, the second husband who left her, the long-lost family up the California coast. But husband number one remained a blip on the screen until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The call comes on a Monday morning from a guy who scavenges defaulted storage units at auction. Last week he bought a stack. They had stuff in them—Kinsey stuff. For thirty bucks, he'll sell her the lot. Kinsey's never been one for personal possessions, but curiosity wins out and she hands over a twenty (she may be curious but she loves a bargain). What she finds amid childhood memorabilia is an old undelivered letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will force her to reexamine her beliefs about the breakup of that first marriage, about the honor of that first husband, about an old unsolved murder. It will put her life in the gravest peril."O" Is for Outlaw: Kinsey's fifteenth adventure into the dark side of human nature.</description>

  <description>Kinsey's skills are about to be sorely tested. She is about to meet her duplicitous match in a couple of world-class prevaricators who quite literally take her for the ride of her life. &lt;br /&gt;L is for Lawless: Call it Kinsey Millhone in bad company. Call it a mystery without a murder, a treasure hunt without a map, a quest novel with truly mixed-up motives. Call it the return of Kinsey as a bad girl - quick-witted and quicksilvery - poking her nose into everybody's dirty laundry as she joins up with a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde in an Our Gang comedy that will take her halfway across the country and leave her with a major headache and an empty bank balance. &lt;br /&gt;America's favorite borderline delinquent is back with her one-liners on tape and her energy level on high, romping through her fastest and funniest adventure in this, her twelfth foray into the alphabet of crime.</description>

  <description>Lonnie Kingman is in a bind. He's smack in the middle of assembling a civil suit, and the private investigator who was doing his pretrial legwork has just dropped dead of a heart attack. In a matter of weeks the court's statute of limitations will put paid to his case. Five years ago David Barney walked when a jury acquitted him of the murder of his rich wife, Isabelle. Now Kingman, acting as attorney for the dead woman's ex-husband and their child (and sure that the jury made a serious mistake), is trying to divest David Barney of the profits of that murder. But time is running out, and David Barney still swears he's innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kinsey Millhone agrees to take over Morley Shine's investigation, she thinks it is a simple matter of tying up the loose ends. Morley might have been careless about his health, but he was an old pro at the business. So it comes as a real shock when she finds his files in disarray, his key informant less than credible, and his witnesses denying ever having spoken with him. It comes as a bigger shock when she finds that every claim David Barney has made checks out. But if Barney didn't murder his wife, who did? It would seem the list of candidates is a long one. In life, Isabelle Barney had stepped on a lot of toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere out there, a killer waits to see just what Kinsey will find out. Somewhere out there, someone's been getting away with murder, and this time it just might turn out to be Kinsey's.</description>

  <description>H IS FOR HUSTLER…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When PI Kinsey Millhone's good friend and colleague Parnell Perkins is found murdered in the parking lot behind California Fidelity Insurance, she can't believe he had any enemies. The only clue that raises a red flag for Kinsey is one of Parnell's files on a Bibianna Diaz, who appears to have made a lucrative career out of scamming insurance companies with phony claims…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H IS FOR HAZARDOUS…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking an alias, Kinsey goes undercover to befriend Bibianna, hoping she'll get close enough to catch the con artist at her own game. But Kinsey never dreams that hanging out with Bibianna will get them both thrown in jail. And when they're released, Bibianna's very jealous, very dangerous ex-fiancé Raymond Maldonado is waiting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H IS FOR HOMICIDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinsey soon discovers the short-tempered thug is the kingpin behind Bibianna's and countless other phony insurance claims. But was Raymond also responsible for Parnell's death? All Kinsey knows is that she'll have to think quick to nab one of the most treacherous criminals she's come face to face with―and keep herself alive…</description>
