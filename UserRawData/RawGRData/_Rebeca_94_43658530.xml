  <description>High school senior Frank Li is a Limbo–his term for Korean-American kids who find themselves caught between their parents’ traditional expectations and their own Southern California upbringing. His parents have one rule when it comes to romance–“Date Korean”–which proves complicated when Frank falls for Brit Means, who is smart, beautiful–and white. Fellow Limbo Joy Song is in a similar predicament, and so they make a pact: they’ll pretend to date each other in order to gain their freedom. Frank thinks it’s the perfect plan, but in the end, Frank and Joy’s fake-dating maneuver leaves him wondering if he ever really understood love–or himself–at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now a major motion picture starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling novel that’s perfect for fans of John Green’s &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;, two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within a few feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You probably think that Aled Last and I are going to fall in love or something. Since he is a boy and I am a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to say—we don’t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Janvier spends most of her time studying. When she’s not studying, she’s up in her room making fan art for her favorite podcast, &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows Aled Last as that quiet boy who gets straight As. But no one knows he’s the creator of &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;, who goes by the name Radio Silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Frances gets a message from Radio Silence asking if she’ll collaborate with him, everything changes. Frances and Aled spend an entire summer working together and becoming best friends. They get each other when no one else does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Aled’s identity as Radio Silence is revealed, Frances fears that the future of &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;—and their friendship—is at risk. Aled helped her find her voice. Without him, will she have the courage to show the world who she really is? Or will she be met with radio silence?</description>

  <description>When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something frightening enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government “rehabilitation camp.” She might have survived the mysterious disease that had killed most of America’s children, but she and the others emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they could not control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones. When the truth comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. She is on the run, desperate to find the only safe haven left for kids like her—East River. She joins a group of kids who have escaped their own camp. Liam, their brave leader, is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can’t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents. When they arrive at East River, nothing is as it seems, least of all its mysterious leader. But there are other forces at work, people who will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at having a life worth living.</description>

  <description>Everyone assumes that Zee is a lesbian. Her classmates, her gym buddies, even her so-called best friend. So many people think that Zee likes girls, even Zee is starting to wonder. Could they be onto something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone assumes that Art is gay. They take one look at his nice clothes and his pretty face and think: &lt;i&gt;well, obviously.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's more to Zee and Art than anyone realizes. When Art first meets Zee, he knows he's found someone special--someone magical. Zee may not be able to see that magic in herself, but Art is bound and determined to show it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What develops is a powerful connection between two people who are beautiful in all the ways they've been told are strange. As they explore their own complexities in gender, sexuality, and identity, they fall for the complexities they find in each other. With his trademark frankness, B.T. Gottfred delves inside both characters' heads in this story about love and living authentically.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice and Mistletoe&lt;/i&gt;, from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, Melissa de la Cruz, is a sweet, sexy and hilarious gender-swapping, genre-satisfying re-telling, set in contemporary America and featuring one snooty Miss Darcy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcy Fitzwilliam is 29, beautiful, successful, and brilliant. She dates hedge funders and basketball stars and is never without her three cellphones—one for work, one for play, and one to throw at her assistant (just kidding). Darcy’s never fallen in love, never has time for anyone else’s drama, and never goes home for Christmas if she can help it. But when her mother falls ill, she comes home to Pemberley, Ohio, to spend the season with her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her parents throw their annual Christmas bash, where she meets one Luke Bennet, the smart, sardonic slacker son of their neighbor. Luke is 32-years-old and has never left home. He’s a carpenter and makes beautiful furniture, and is content with his simple life. He comes from a family of five brothers, each one less ambitious than the other. When Darcy and Luke fall into bed after too many eggnogs, Darcy thinks it’s just another one night stand. But why can’t she stop thinking of Luke? What is it about him? And can she fall in love, or will her pride and his prejudice against big-city girls stand in their way?</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;lucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it's the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth's last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie's only hope for rescuing her brother—or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

  <description>Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate . . . until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

  <description>The idea for &lt;i&gt;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/i&gt; famously came to Robert Louis Stevenson one night in a dream. This graphic novel adaptation by Andrzej Klimowski and Danusia Schejbal has transformed that dream into an exquisite nightmare. Their faithful adaptation combines an already-chilling tale with truly haunting artwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a respectable London doctor who ends up leading a dreadful double life—as a doctor, and as a cold-blooded murderer. Fans of Stevenson’s original novel and new readers will be riveted by this fascinating moral thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel’s story is about to be completely rewritten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt; brilliantly explores the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</description>

  <description>Two misfits.&lt;br /&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limited collector’s edition of Eleanor &amp;amp; Park features a new jacket, an exclusive Q&amp;amp;A with author Rainbow Rowell, and several stunning pieces of fan art.</description>

  <description>Dubbed “Dumplin’” by her former beauty queen mom, Willowdean has always been at home in her own skin. Her thoughts on having the ultimate bikini body? Put a bikini on your body. With her all-American beauty best friend, Ellen, by her side, things have always worked...until Will takes a job at Harpy’s, the local fast-food joint. There she meets Private School Bo, a hot former jock. Will isn’t surprised to find herself attracted to Bo. But she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; surprised when he seems to like her back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of finding new heights of self-assurance in her relationship with Bo, Will starts to doubt herself. So she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine: entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant—along with several other unlikely candidates—to show the world that she deserves to be up there as much as any girl does. Along the way, she’ll shock the hell out of Clover City—and maybe herself most of all.</description>

  <description>Natasha: I’m a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I’m definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is twelve hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won’t be my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel: I’ve always been the good son, the good student, living up to my parents’ high expectations. Never the poet. Or the dreamer. But when I see her, I forget about all that. Something about Natasha makes me think that fate has something much more extraordinary in store—for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Universe: Every moment in our lives has brought us to this single moment. A million futures lie before us. Which one will come true?</description>

  <description>Amy Curry is not looking forward to her summer. Her mother decided to move across the country and now it's Amy's responsibility to get their car from California to Connecticut. The only problem is, since her father died in a car accident, she isn't ready to get behind the wheel. Enter Roger. An old family friend, he also has to make the cross-country trip - and has plenty of baggage of his own. The road home may be unfamiliar - especially with their friendship venturing into uncharted territory - but together, Amy and Roger will figure out how to map their way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Flying Start author of &lt;i&gt;Amy &amp;amp; Roger’s Epic Detour&lt;/i&gt;, a powerful novel about hope in the face of heartbreak. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Edwards’ family might not be the closest-knit—everyone is a little too busy and overscheduled—but for the most part, they get along just fine. Then Taylor’s dad gets devastating news, and her parents decide that the family will spend one last summer all together at their old lake house in the Pocono Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crammed into a place much smaller and more rustic than they are used to, they begin to get to know each other again. And Taylor discovers that the people she thought she had left behind haven’t actually gone anywhere. Her former best friend is still around, as is her first boyfriend…and he’s much cuter at seventeen than he was at twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer progresses and the Edwards become more of a family, they’re more aware than ever that they’re battling a ticking clock. Sometimes, though, there is just enough time to get a second chance—with family, with friends, and with love.</description>

  <description>Doomed to—or blessed with—eternal life after drinking from a magic spring, the Tuck family wanders about trying to live as inconspicuously and comfortably as they can. When ten-year-old Winnie Foster stumbles on their secret, the Tucks take her home and explain why living forever at one age is less a blessing that it might seem. Complications arise when Winnie is followed by a stranger who wants to market the spring water for a fortune.</description>

  <description>My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.</description>

      <![CDATA[Since I didn't write a review about this book before, I'm just going to do it now.<br />I really liked the Twilight book in comic book/ graphic novel form! The illustrations were done very well, I liked the changes in black and white to little bits of color, although at times I had wished there h...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Before.&lt;/b&gt; Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;After.&lt;/b&gt; Nothing is ever the same.</description>
