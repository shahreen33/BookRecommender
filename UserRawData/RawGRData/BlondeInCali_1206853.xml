  <description>Zee is nobody's fairy tale princess. Almost six-foot, with a redhead's temper and a shattered hip, she has a long list of worries: never-ending bills, her beautiful, gullible sister, her five-year-old nephew, her housebound mother, and her drug-dealing boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zee may not be a princess, but Gentry is an actual knight, complete with sword, armor, and a code of honor. Two years ago the voices he hears called him to be Zee's champion. Both shy and autistic, he's barely spoken to her since, but he has kept watch, ready to come to her aid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an abduction tears Zee's family apart, she turns to the last person she ever imagined--Gentry--and sets in motion a chain of events that will not only change both of their lives, but bind them to one another forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A provocative love story between a tough Kansas woman on a crooked path to redemption and the unlikeliest of champions, from the New York Times bestselling author of All the Ugly and Wonderful Things.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Already being hailed as "a &lt;i&gt;Grapes of Wrath&lt;/i&gt; for our times" and "a new American classic," &lt;i&gt;American Dirt&lt;/i&gt; is a rare exploration into the inner hearts of people willing to sacrifice everything for a glimmer of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lydia Quixano Perez lives in the Mexican city of Acapulco. She runs a bookstore. She has a son, Luca, the love of her life, and a wonderful husband who is a journalist. And while there are cracks beginning to show in Acapulco because of the drug cartels, her life is, by and large, fairly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though she knows they'll never sell, Lydia stocks some of her all-time favorite books in her store. And then one day a man enters the shop to browse and comes up to the register with four books he would like to buy--two of them her favorites. Javier is erudite. He is charming. And, unbeknownst to Lydia, he is the &lt;i&gt;jefe&lt;/i&gt; of the newest drug cartel that has gruesomely taken over the city. When Lydia's husband's tell-all profile of Javier is published, none of their lives will ever be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Dirt&lt;/i&gt; will leave readers utterly changed. It is a page-turner; it is a literary achievement; it is filled with poignancy, drama, and humanity on every page. It is one of the most important books for our times.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;“Gorgeous writing, gorgeous story.” &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;—Sandra Cisneros&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“An essential read for our times.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;—Cristina Garcia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old Ana Cancion never dreamed of moving to America, the way the girls she grew up with in the Dominican countryside did. But when Juan Ruiz proposes and promises to take her to New York City, she has to say yes. It doesn’t matter that he is twice her age, that there is no love between them. Their marriage is an opportunity for her entire close-knit family to eventually immigrate. So on New Year’s Day, 1965, Ana leaves behind everything she knows and becomes Ana Ruiz, a wife confined to a cold six-floor walk-up in Washington Heights. Lonely and miserable, Ana hatches a reckless plan to escape. But at the bus terminal, she is stopped by Cesar, Juan’s free-spirited younger brother, who convinces her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Dominican Republic slides into political turmoil, Juan returns to protect his family’s assets, leaving Cesar to take care of Ana. Suddenly, Ana is free to take English lessons at a local church, lie on the beach at Coney Island, see a movie at Radio City Music Hall, go dancing with Cesar, and imagine the possibility of a different kind of life in America. When Juan returns, Ana must decide once again between her heart and her duty to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bright, musical prose that reflects the energy of New York City, Angie Cruz's &lt;i&gt;Dominicana &lt;/i&gt;is a vital portrait of the immigrant experience and the timeless coming-of-age story of a young woman finding her voice in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Zee is nobody's fairy tale princess. Almost six-foot, with a redhead's temper and a shattered hip, she has a long list of worries: never-ending bills, her beautiful, gullible sister, her five-year-old nephew, her housebound mother, and her drug-dealing boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zee may not be a princess, but Gentry is an actual knight, complete with sword, armor, and code of honor. Two years ago the voices he hears called him to be Zee's champion. He's barely spoken to her since, but he has kept watch, ready to come to her aid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Zee's sister is taken hostage during a violent escape at the prison where she volunteers. To protect her family, Zee turns to the last person she ever imagined--Gentry. With the authorities no closer to finding her sister, she decides to take matters into her own hands and, with Gentry at her side, sets in motion a series of events that will alter their lives, and those of everyone they love, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of All the Ugly and Wonderful Things comes a newly provocative love story between the unlikeliest of people, and a tale of one woman's crooked path to redemption.</description>

  <description>I didn’t plan on him. &lt;br /&gt;Or for him. &lt;br /&gt;Or anything that had to do with Cal Donovan from Boston. &lt;br /&gt;Meeting him had been a complete and utter surprise, taking me one hundred percent off guard. I met new people every single day in my line of work and none of them affected me. Wasn’t that the way of things though? You could meet a thousand people and they’d all mean nothing to you. But then you’d meet that one and they suddenly meant everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Desire as we’ve never seen it before: a riveting true story about the sex lives of three real American women, based on nearly a decade of reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts, destroys our lives, and it’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result,&lt;i&gt; Three Women&lt;/i&gt;, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written and one of the most anticipated books of the year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the # 1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/i&gt;, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a &lt;i&gt;good girl&lt;/i&gt; to be a good person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. "At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time," she muses. "After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is." Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; is a love story like no other.</description>

  <description>This debut novel by an Arab-American voice,takes us inside the lives of conservative Arab women living in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brooklyn, eighteen-year-old Deya is starting to meet with suitors. Though she doesn’t want to get married, her grandparents give her no choice. History is repeating itself: Deya’s mother, Isra, also had no choice when she left Palestine as a teenager to marry Adam. Though Deya was raised to believe her parents died in a car accident, a secret note from a mysterious, yet familiar-looking woman makes Deya question everything she was told about her past. As the narrative alternates between the lives of Deya and Isra, she begins to understand the dark, complex secrets behind her community.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The passionate new romance from E L James, author of the phenomenal #1 bestselling Fifty Shades Trilogy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; London, 2019. Life has been easy for Maxim Trevelyan. With his good looks, aristocratic connections, and money, he’s never had to work and he’s rarely slept alone. But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family’s noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It’s a role he’s not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who’s recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past.  Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she’s an alluring mystery, and Maxim’s longing for her deepens into a passion that he’s never experienced and dares not name. Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her? And what will she do when she learns that he’s been hiding secrets of his own?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; From the heart of London through wild, rural Cornwall to the bleak, forbidding beauty of the Balkans, &lt;i&gt;The Mister&lt;/i&gt; is a roller-coaster ride of danger and desire that leaves the reader breathless to the very last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Follow &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elin Hilderbrand back in time and join a Nantucket family as they experience the drama, intrigue, and upheaval of a 1960s summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the most tumultuous summer of the twentieth century! It's 1969, and for the Levin family, the times they are a-changing. Every year the children have looked forward to spending the summer at their grandmother's historic home in downtown Nantucket: but this year Blair, the oldest sister, is marooned in Boston, pregnant with twins and unable to travel. Middle sister Kirby, a nursing student, is caught up in the thrilling vortex of civil rights protests, a passion which takes her to Martha's Vineyard with her best friend, Mary Jo Kopechne. Only son Tiger is an infantry soldier, recently deployed to Vietnam. Thirteen-year-old Jessie suddenly feels like an only child, marooned in the house with her out-of-touch grandmother who is hiding some secrets of her own. As the summer heats up, Teddy Kennedy sinks a car in Chappaquiddick, a man flies to the moon, and Jessie experiences some sinking and flying herself, as she grows into her own body and mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first "historical novel," rich with the details of an era that shaped both a country and an island thirty miles out to sea, Elin Hilderbrand once again proves her title as queen of the summer novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous break up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity...until now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it's the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she's twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another band getting noticed is The Six, led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she's pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Honesty is the best policy…except maybe when it comes to marriage in this brilliant, funny novel about the high price of perfection from bestselling author Camille Pagán.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife. Mother. Breadwinner. Penelope Ruiz-Kar is doing it all—and barely keeping it together. Meanwhile, her best friend, Jenny Sweet, appears to be sailing through life. As close as the two women are, Jenny’s passionate marriage, pristine house, and ultra-polite child stand in stark contrast to Penelope’s underemployed husband, Sanjay, their unruly brood, and the daily grind she calls a career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a shocking tragedy reveals that Jenny’s life is far from perfect. Reeling, Penelope vows to stop keeping the peace and finally deal with the issues in her relationship. So she comes up with a radical proposal for Sanjay: both will write a list of changes they want each other to make—then commit to complete and total honesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems like a smart idea quickly spirals out of control, revealing new rifts and even deeper secrets. As Penelope stares down the possible implosion of her marriage, she must ask herself: When it comes to love, is honesty really the best policy?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“The greatest works of poetry are the stories we tell about ourselves."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the renowned poet Fiona Skinner is asked about the inspiration behind her iconic work, &lt;i&gt;The Love Poem&lt;/i&gt;, she tells her audience a story about her family and a betrayal that reverberates through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins in a big yellow house, with a funeral, an iron poker, and a brief variation forever known as the Pause: a free and feral summer in a middle-class Connecticut town. Caught between the predictable life they once led and an uncertain future that stretches before them, the Skinner siblings—fierce Renee, sensitive Caroline, golden-boy Joe and watchful Fiona—emerge from the Pause staunchly loyal and deeply connected.  Two decades later, the siblings find themselves once again confronted with a family crisis that tests the strength of these bonds and forces them to question the life choices they’ve made and to ask what, exactly, they are willing to do for love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping yet intimate epic about one American family, &lt;i&gt;The Last Romantics&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable exploration of the ties that bind us together, the responsibilities we embrace and the duties we resent, and how we can lose—and sometimes rescue—the ones we love. A novel that pierces the heart and lingers in the mind, it is also a beautiful meditation on the power of stories—how they guide us through difficult times, help us understand the past, and point the way toward our future.</description>

  <description>Joe Goldberg is no stranger to hiding bodies. In the past ten years, this thirty-something has buried four of them, collateral damage in his quest for love. Now he’s heading west to Los Angeles, the city of second chances, determined to put his past behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Hollywood, Joe blends in effortlessly with the other young upstarts. He eats guac, works in a bookstore, and flirts with a journalist neighbor. But while others seem fixated on their own reflections, Joe can’t stop looking over his shoulder. The problem with hidden bodies is that they don’t always stay that way. They re-emerge, like dark thoughts, multiplying and threatening to destroy what Joe wants most: true love. And when he finds it in a darkened room in Soho House, he’s more desperate than ever to keep his secrets buried. He doesn’t want to hurt his new girlfriend—he wants to be with her forever. But if she ever finds out what he’s done, he may not have a choice...</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Told from the dual perspective of a husband and a wife, &lt;i&gt;The Swing of Things&lt;/i&gt; is a sexy, provocative, page-turning novel about a suburban couple who wants out of their routine—but will they take things too far?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Jayne Larsen loves her stay-at-home husband. Eric is attentive and a great father to their daughter. He’s also unfailingly committed to their Wednesday date nights—but things have gotten too predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Theo and Mia Winters, the effortlessly cool, attractive couple who are the center of everyone’s attention. They are blissfully happy and ready to share their secret for keeping things spicy. But there are rules. And breaking them has consequences. As Jayne and Eric explore a more modern definition of marriage, they are forced to confront whether they’ve given up too much in the pursuit of trying to have it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The follow-up to Raintree's sparkling debut Perfectly Undone, MIDNIGHT AT THE WANDERING VINEYARD brilliantly meshes the provocative relationship fiction of Jennifer Weiner with the nuanced family dynamics of Karen White in this story of a young woman who reconnects with her estranged best friend to complete their teenage bucket list, but the man who came between them years ago reappears to challenge their bond once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman at a crossroads in her life returns home to her family's vineyard in California when tragedy strikes and reconnects with her estranged childhood best friend. They decide to complete the bucket list they created the summer they were 18, the summer that saw their friendship torn apart. But when the man who came between them all those years ago reappears, it challenges their fragile new bond and pushes each woman to confront past hurts and buried truths.</description>

She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A terrifying exploration of how vulnerable we all are to stalking and manipulation, debut author Caroline Kepnes delivers a razor-sharp novel for our hyper-connected digital age. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; is a compulsively readable page-turner that’s being compared to &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt;, and Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;Misery&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A love story about what happens after you meet, or rather, &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;meet the one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic...and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>When Elise Perez meets Jamey Hyde on a desolate winter afternoon, fate implodes, and neither of their lives will ever be the same. Although they are next-door neighbors in New Haven, they come from different worlds. Elise grew up in a housing project without a father and didn't graduate from high school. Jamey is a junior at Yale, heir to a private investment bank fortune and beholden to high family expectations. The attraction is instant, and what starts out as sexual obsession turns into something greater, stranger, and impossible to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unlikely couple moves to Manhattan in hopes of forging an adult life together, but Jamey's family intervenes in desperation, and the consequences of staying together are suddenly severe. And when a night out with old friends takes a shocking turn, Jamey and Elise find themselves fighting not just for their love but also for their lives.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center—a women’s reproductive health services clinic—its staff offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester disguised as a patient, who now stands in the cross hairs of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed individual himself, vowing to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the same place on this fateful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Picoult—one of the most fearless writers of our time—tackles a complicated issue in this gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to be a good parent? &lt;i&gt;A Spark of Light&lt;/i&gt; will inspire debate, conversation . . . and, hopefully, understanding.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The repercussions of an illicit affair unfold in this short story by bestselling author Taylor Jenkins Reid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear stranger…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate young woman in Southern California sits down to write a letter to a man she’s never met—a choice that will forever change both their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My heart goes out to you, David. Even though I do not know you…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correspondence between Carrie Allsop and David Mayer reveals, piece by piece, the painful details of a devastating affair between their spouses. With each commiserating scratch of the pen, they confess their fears and bare their souls. They share the bewilderment over how things went so wrong and come to wonder where to go from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told entirely through the letters of two comforting strangers and those of two illicit lovers, &lt;i&gt;Evidence of the Affair&lt;/i&gt; explores the complex nature of the heart. And ultimately, for one woman, how liberating it can be when it’s broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kristan Higgins is beloved for her heartfelt novels filled with humor and wisdom. Now, in her newest novel, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, she tackles an issue every woman deals with: body image and self-acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerson, Georgia, and Marley have been best friends ever since they met at a weight-loss camp as teens. When Emerson tragically passes away, she leaves one final wish for her best friends: to conquer the fears they still carry as adults. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each of them, that means something different. For Marley, it’s coming to terms with the survivor’s guilt she’s carried around since her twin sister’s death, which has left her blind to the real chance for romance in her life. For Georgia, it’s about learning to stop trying to live up to her mother’s and brother’s ridiculous standards, and learning to accept the love her ex-husband has tried to give her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Marley and Georgia grow stronger, the real meaning of Emerson’s dying wish becomes truly clear: more than anything, she wanted her friends to love themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A novel of compassion and insight, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT tells the story of two women who learn to embrace themselves just the way they are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A best-friends-to lovers standalone romance from New York Times bestselling author Kendall Ryan. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a rather uncomfortable ladies’ night involving a cucumber-wielding instructor with judgy eyes, I’m forced to admit my weaknesses. Rather than point blame at my lack of a sex life, I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a junior executive who’s clawed her way up the corporate ladder, failure is not in my vocabulary. Confident and bold in other areas of my life, I have to admit it’s time to up my bedroom game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asking my friend Slate Cruz is really the only option. Slate is like a walking billboard for sex. The man gets more ass than a toilet seat. There’s no way I’ll want more from this playboy than a little inspiration to revive my inner sex kitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, what happens if I do?</description>

  <description>With extraordinary access to the West Wing, Michael Wolff reveals what happened behind-the-scenes in the first nine months of the most controversial presidency of our time in &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the country―and the world―has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This riveting and explosive account of Trump’s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including:&lt;br /&gt;-- What President Trump’s staff really thinks of him&lt;br /&gt;-- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama&lt;br /&gt;-- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired&lt;br /&gt;-- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn’t be in the same room&lt;br /&gt;-- Who is really directing the Trump administration’s strategy in the wake of Bannon’s firing&lt;br /&gt;-- What the secret to communicating with Trump is&lt;br /&gt;-- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury&lt;/i&gt; shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was the first person to inspire her, to move her, to truly understand her. Was he meant to be the last?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy is faced with a life-altering choice. But before she can make her decision, she must start her story—their story—at the very beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lucy and Gabe meet as seniors at Columbia University on a day that changes both of their lives forever. Together, they decide they want their lives to mean something, to matter. When they meet again a year later, it seems fated—perhaps they’ll find life’s meaning in each other. But then Gabe becomes a photojournalist assigned to the Middle East and Lucy pursues a career in New York. What follows is a thirteen-year journey of dreams, desires, jealousies, betrayals, and, ultimately, of love. Was it fate that brought them together? Is it choice that has kept them away? Their journey takes Lucy and Gabe continents apart, but never out of each other’s hearts.</description>

  <description>Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance—and the subsequent cover-up—will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a "what if" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.</description>

But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff.

  <description>It's 1946 and author Juliet Ashton can't think what to write next. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he's acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it's not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</description>

  <description>When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight. They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ask about the past.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t expect a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearts get infiltrated.&lt;br /&gt;Promises get broken.&lt;br /&gt;Rules get shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Love gets ugly.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the riveting new novel from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;First Comes Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed&lt;/i&gt;, three very different people must choose between their family and their values.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Browning is living the good life after marrying into Nashville’s elite. More recently, her husband made a fortune selling his tech business, and their adored son has been accepted to Princeton. Yet sometimes the middle-class small-town girl in Nina wonders if she’s strayed from the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Volpe is a single dad working multiple jobs while struggling to raise his headstrong daughter, Lyla. His road has been lonely, long, and hard, but he finally starts to relax after Lyla earns a scholarship to Windsor Academy, Nashville’s most prestigious private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid so much wealth and privilege, Lyla doesn’t always fit in—and her overprotective father doesn’t help—but in most ways, she’s a typical teenage girl, happy and thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one photograph, snapped in a drunken moment at a party, changes everything. As the image spreads like wildfire, the Windsor community is instantly polarized, buzzing with controversy and assigning blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the lies and scandal, Tom, Nina, and Lyla are forced together—all questioning their closest relationships, asking themselves who they really are, and searching for the courage to live a life of true meaning.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Kendall Ryan comes a standalone romance about a swoony single dad and the quirky new neighbor he falls for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night was the most embarrassing night of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was THAT girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, the highly intoxicated chick celebrating her thirtieth with her two best friends—the ones who are happily married. And the more I drank, the more I wanted to do something reckless to celebrate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reckless, I meant the sexy and alluring man dressed in a business suit standing near the bar. You know his type—tall, dark, and handsome. I was sure he was out of my league, but I'd had just enough alcohol that things like that no longer seemed to matter. I'm not fat, mind you, but you can tell I like French fries, so there's that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He took me home and I enjoyed the hottest birthday sex of my life, well until it came to a screeching, and rather unwelcome halt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing quite like being interrupted mid-ride with a little voice asking: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What are you doing to my daddy?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kill me now…... or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to find out the man I rode like a bull at the rodeo is my new landlord.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Happiness for Beginner&lt;/i&gt;s comes an unforgettable love story about finding joy even in the darkest of circumstances. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Jacobsen is just about to step into the bright future she’s worked for so hard and so long: a new dream job, a fiancé she adores, and the promise of a picture-perfect life just around the corner. Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in a brief, tumultuous moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Maggie must confront the unthinkable. First there is her fiancé, Chip, who wallows in self-pity while simultaneously expecting to be forgiven. Then, there's her sister Kit, who shows up after pulling a three-year vanishing act. Finally, there's Ian, her physical therapist, the one the nurses said was too tough for her. Ian, who won't let her give in to her pity, and who sees her like no one has seen her before. Sometimes the last thing you want is the one thing you need. Sometimes we all need someone to catch us when we fall. And sometimes love can find us in the least likely place we would ever expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Walk Away&lt;/i&gt; is Katherine Center at her very best—a masterpiece of a novel that is both hopeful and hilarious; truthful and wise; tender and brave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Everyone in Nashville knows Nathan Dumont. That’s what happens when you develop half a town and sleep with the rest. &lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, his fiancee disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;Last night, he proposed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had wanted to escape my life, the seedy strip club and the mountain of bills. I had seized the opportunity to live in a mansion, fill my days with country clubs and caviar, my nights with romance and sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should have done my homework first.</description>

  <description>Set in the early 1970s against the specter of the Manson girls, when the peace and love movement begins to turn ugly, this is the story of a runaway teenager's disappearance and her sister's quest to discover the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline Leavitt is at her mesmerizing best in this haunting, nuanced portrait of love, sisters, and the impossible legacy of family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1969, and sixteen-year-old Lucy is about to run away with a much older man to live off the grid in rural Pennsylvania, a rash act that will have vicious repercussions for both her and her older sister, Charlotte. As Lucy's default caretaker for most of their lives, Charlotte's youth has been marked by the burden of responsibility, but never more so than when Lucy's dream of a rural paradise turns into nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gorgeous prose and indelible characters, Cruel Beautiful World examines the intricate, infinitesimal distance between seduction and love, loyalty and duty, and what happens when you're responsible for things you can't fix.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With extraordinary access to the Trump White House, Michael Wolff tells the inside story of the most controversial presidency of our time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first nine months of Donald Trump's term were stormy, outrageous—and absolutely mesmerizing. Now, thanks to his deep access to the West Wing, bestselling author Michael Wolff tells the riveting story of how Trump launched a tenure as volatile and fiery as the man himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this explosive book, Wolff provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office. Among the revelations: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;— What President Trump's staff really thinks of him&lt;br /&gt;— What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama &lt;br /&gt;— Why FBI director James Comey was really fired&lt;br /&gt;— Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn't be in the same room&lt;br /&gt;— Who is really directing the Trump administration's strategy in the wake of Bannon's firing&lt;br /&gt;— What the secret to communicating with Trump is&lt;br /&gt;— What the Trump administration has in common with the movie &lt;i&gt;The Producers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, Michael Wolff's &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury&lt;/i&gt; shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47878723-lilith" rel="nofollow"&gt;B076YYXQ9S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, intelligent, independent, strong-willed, wealthy... &lt;br /&gt;Lilith Fontenot seems, by all appearances, to have it all. But that's not how the highest paid prostitute in New Orleans sees herself. &lt;br /&gt;A stain on society. A scourge. A waste. Outsider. Prisoner... &lt;br /&gt;Any idyllic dream of the normal life she may have once imagined, Lilith buried long ago. Her only plan now is survival. &lt;br /&gt;But mob boss Nico Santelli and community center owner Soti Christos have not given up on Lilith. Each has his own very specific, very opposing, plans for her, and neither will rest until it becomes a reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WHORE is a singularly bracing take on an ancient tale of tireless love, betrayal, and the possibility of redemption.</description>

  <description>All three books of the NY Times Bestselling Fixed Trilogy are included in this bundle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20809413.Fixed_on_You" title="Fixed on You" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fixed on You&lt;/a&gt; (Book 1): &lt;/b&gt; Stalking and restraining orders are a thing of Alayna Wither's past. With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured out--move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan. But what Alayna didn't figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. He's smart, rich, and gorgeous--the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. Except, Hudson's fixed his sights on her. He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it. Avoiding him isn't an option after he offers a business proposition she can't turn down and she's drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that she's fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18294010.Found_in_You" title="Found in You" rel="nofollow"&gt;Found in You&lt;/a&gt; (Book 2):&lt;/b&gt; Alayna Withers has only had one kind of relationship: the kind that makes her obsessive and stalker-crazy. Now that Hudson Pierce has let her into his heart, she's determined to break down the remaining walls between them so they can build a foundation that's based on more than just amazing sex. Except Hudson's not the only one with secrets. &lt;br /&gt;With their pasts pulling them into a web of unfounded mistrust, Alayna turns to the one person who knows Hudson the best--Celia, the woman he almost married. Hoping for insight from someone who understands all sides of the story, Alayna forms a bond with Celia that goes too far--revealing things about Hudson that could end their love for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first relationship where Alayna hasn't spiraled out of control. And she might lose Hudson anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20420468.Forever_with_You" title="Forever with You" rel="nofollow"&gt;Forever with You&lt;/a&gt; (Book 3):&lt;/b&gt; Alayna Withers relationship with Hudson Pierce has tested both her and his ability to trust. They decide that the only way they can move forward together is with open doors and transparency. It won't be easy for the scarred lovers, but they're committed to each other more now than ever. Alayna, in particular, has grown through their trials, and has emerged more confident and faithful to the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while the pair is focused on the future, their past shows up again to threaten their fragile bond. Promises that were made are broken, and Alayna learns that Hudson still has very potent secrets--secrets that will tear them both apart. As much as she feels for him, her ability to forgive and forget is tested beyond her limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though she found the only man who could fix her, a forever with Hudson seems more and more out of reach.</description>

  <description>Eve Fletcher is floundering. A forty-six-year-old divorcee whose beloved, clueless only child has just left for college, Eve is slowly learning to contend with life on her own when, late one night her phone lights up with a text message. Sent from an anonymous number, the mysterious sender tells Eve, “U r my MILF!” It's nothing--just an annoying prank--but she can't get it out of her head. As Eve makes new friends, takes a community college course in Gender Studies, and reaches out to a younger co-worker, the message continues to haunt her, leading her into an online fixation that threatens to upend her quiet suburban existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Eve’s son Brendan, is discovering that the oafish frat-boy charm that impressed high school girls may not be so enticing to college women. Increasingly isolated, with mediocre grades and a confusing crush on a softball-playing social justice champion, Brendan struggles to adjust to a campus ill disposed to his brand of white-dude bravado. As the New England autumn turns cold, both mother and son find themselves enmeshed in ethically fraught situations that come to a head one fateful November night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coming-of-age novel about the sexual awakening of a middle-aged woman, &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Fletcher&lt;/i&gt; is a provocative, witty look at contemporary sexual politics and timeless moral dilemmas--a moving and funny examination of sexuality, identity, and the big clarifying mistakes people can make when they're no longer sure who they are and where they belong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dazzling debut novel from an exciting new voice, &lt;i&gt;The Mothers &lt;/i&gt;is a surprising story about young love, a big secret in a small community—and the things that ultimately haunt us most.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance—and the subsequent cover-up—will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In entrancing, lyrical prose, &lt;i&gt;The Mothers &lt;/i&gt;asks whether a "what if" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.</description>

  <description>What do you do when you discover that the person you've built your life around never existed? When "it could never happen to me" &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;happen to you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the questions facing Jen Waite when she begins to realize that her loving husband--the father of her infant daughter, her best friend, the love of her life--fits the textbook definition of psychopath. In a raw, first-person account, Waite recounts each heartbreaking discovery, every life-destroying lie, and reveals what happens once the dust finally settles on her demolished marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a disturbing email sparks Waite's suspicion that her husband is having an affair, she tries to uncover the truth and rebuild trust in her marriage. Instead, she finds more lies, infidelity, and betrayal than she could have imagined. Waite obsessively analyzes her relationship, trying to find a single moment from the last five years that isn't part of the long-con of lies and manipulation. With a dual-timeline narrative structure, we see Waite's romance bud, bloom, and wither simultaneously, making the heartbreak and disbelief even more affecting.</description>

  <description>From Taylor Jenkins Reid, “a genius when it comes to stories about life and love” (&lt;i&gt;Redbook&lt;/i&gt;), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress’s relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Written with Reid’s signature talent for “creating complex, likable characters” (&lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.</description>

  <description>From the author of the “clever, creative, and sweetly delicious” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;The Coincidence of Coconut Cake&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about a frustrated wife and mother who hatches a scheme to reignite her marriage—and risks everything in a gamble she hopes is a sure bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Milwaukee-area wife and mother MJ Boudreaux notices her husband Chris seems more interested in the casino than her, she’s more bothered that she isn’t upset than by her husband’s absence. She picks up poker as a way for them to spend more time together—and reignite their marital flame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the game doesn’t give her the quality time with Chris that she’d hoped, MJ finds she has a knack for it. Increasingly unhappy at home, she turns to the felt top of the poker table for comfort. Intoxicated with newfound freedom, MJ begins spending more time at the gambling tables and less with her family, finally carving out for herself a place outside her role of wife and mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a string of great wins, MJ finds herself in Vegas, attracting the attention of a certain magnetic poker star. But when she’s forced to choose between her family and her new exciting lifestyle, the stakes may be higher than she thought and MJ will have to play her hand carefully…or risk losing it all.</description>

  <description>Love. &lt;br /&gt;Passion. &lt;br /&gt;Obsession. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was no way to distinguish one from the other in my life. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing in this world could destroy a bond as fierce as ours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or so I believed… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because life interfered. &lt;br /&gt;Impulsive decisions, reaped unyielding consequences. &lt;br /&gt;Fate had a way of making you question your sanity. &lt;br /&gt;Loyalties were blurred. &lt;br /&gt;Priorities, poisoned. &lt;br /&gt;And destiny… destiny dispelled all our beliefs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end love was just too consuming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tragic even. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, love... crossed many unfathomable lines.</description>

  <description>Six responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It’s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there’s anything they can count on, it’s each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clementine and Erika are each other’s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don’t hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid’s larger than life personalities there will be a welcome respite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later, it won’t stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can’t stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn’t gone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don’t say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Forever, Interrupted&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;After I Do&lt;/i&gt; comes a breathtaking new novel about a young woman whose fate hinges on the choice she makes after bumping into an old flame; in alternating chapters, we see two possible scenarios unfold—with stunningly different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of twenty-nine, Hannah Martin still has no idea what she wants to do with her life. She has lived in six different cities and held countless meaningless jobs since graduating college. On the heels of leaving yet another city, Hannah moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby’s guestroom. Shortly after getting back to town, Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she’s ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly, these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah, as well as the people around her. As the two alternate realities run their course, &lt;i&gt;Maybe in Another Life&lt;/i&gt; raises questions about fate and true love: Is anything meant to be? How much in our life is determined by chance? And perhaps, most compellingly: Is there such a thing as a soul mate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah believes there is. And, in both worlds, she believes she’s found him.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Three students: dead. &lt;br /&gt;Carly Johnson: vanished without a trace. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two decades have passed since an inferno swept through Elmbridge High, claiming the lives of three teenagers and causing one student, Carly Johnson, to disappear. The main suspect: Kaitlyn, "the girl of nowhere." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn's diary, discovered in the ruins of Elmbridge High, reveals the thoughts of a disturbed mind. Its charred pages tell a sinister version of events that took place that tragic night, and the girl of nowhere is caught in the center of it all. But many claim Kaitlyn doesn't exist, and in a way, she doesn't - because she is the alter ego of Carly Johnson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carly gets the day. Kaitlyn has the night. It's during the night that a mystery surrounding the Dead House unravels and a dark, twisted magic ruins the lives of each student that dares touch it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut author Dawn Kurtagich masterfully weaves together a thrilling and terrifying story using psychiatric reports, witness testimonials, video footage, and the discovered diary - and as the mystery grows, the horrifying truth about what happened that night unfolds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I have one rule: Don’t shit where you eat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of the women in the condo complex I own would love some one-on-one playtime, and why wouldn’t they? I’m young, fit, attractive, and loaded. Not to mention I’m packing a sizable bulge below the belt. It’s a combination that drops panties on a regular basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yay, me, right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my cock, troublemaker that he is, has been confined to my trousers by my business partner. A concession I agreed to, and one that’s never been hard to enforce until Emery moves in across the hall. She’s smart, young, determined, and sexy as hell. I want a taste. I won’t stop until I’m buried deep inside the succulent new-in-town brunette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being warned about my past, she does her best to steer clear, but I’m about to show her that underneath it all, I’m a guy with a heart of gold and a cock of steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Hayden Oliver, and this is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCREWED is standalone romantic comedy by New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Kendall Ryan.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>To the Green-eyed Lovebird:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met fifteen years ago, almost to the day, when I moved my stuff into the NYU dorm room next to yours at Senior House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You called us fast friends. I like to think it was more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We lived on nothing but the excitement of finding ourselves through music (you were obsessed with Jeff Buckley), photography (I couldn’t stop taking pictures of you), hanging out in Washington Square Park, and all the weird things we did to make money. I learned more about myself that year than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, somehow, it all fell apart. We lost touch the summer after graduation when I went to South America to work for National Geographic. When I came back, you were gone. A part of me still wonders if I pushed you too hard after the wedding…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t see you again until a month ago. It was a Wednesday. You were rocking back on your heels, balancing on that thick yellow line that runs along the subway platform, waiting for the F train. I didn’t know it was you until it was too late, and then you were gone. Again. You said my name; I saw it on your lips. I tried to will the train to stop, just so I could say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing you, all of the youthful feelings and memories came flooding back to me, and now I’ve spent the better part of a month wondering what your life is like. I might be totally out of my mind, but would you like to get a drink with me and catch up on the last decade and a half?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sweet Thing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nowhere But Here&lt;/i&gt; comes a love story about a Craigslist “missed connection” post that gives two people a second chance at love fifteen years after they were separated in New York City.</description>

  <description>When Kate Watts abandoned her law career to open a food pantry in Northeast Minneapolis, she never dreamed it would be this difficult. Facing the heartbreaking prospect of turning hungry people away, she is grateful for the anonymous donations that begin appearing at the end of each month. Determined to identify and thank her secret benefactor, she launches a plan and catches Ian —a charismatic hacker with a Robin Hood complex—in the act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian intrigues Kate in a way no man ever has. But after learning he’s snooped around on her personal computer, she demands retribution. Impressed with her tolerance and captivated by her spirit, he complies and begins to slowly charm his way past her defenses. Time spent with Ian is never boring, and Kate soon finds herself falling for the mysterious hacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ian has enemies and they’re growing restless. In the hacking world, exploiting a target’s weakness is paramount, and no price is too high to stop an attack. And when Kate learns exactly how much Ian has paid, she’ll discover just how strong her love is for the man who has hacked his way into her heart.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Forever, Interrupted&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;After I Do&lt;/i&gt; comes a breathtaking new novel about a young woman whose fate hinges on the choice she makes after bumping into an old flame; in alternating chapters, we see two possible scenarios unfold—with stunningly different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of twenty-nine, Hannah Martin still has no idea what she wants to do with her life. She has lived in six different cities and held countless meaningless jobs since graduating college. On the heels of leaving yet another city, Hannah moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby’s guestroom. Shortly after getting back to town, Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she’s ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly, these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah, as well as the people around her. As the two alternate realities run their course, &lt;i&gt;Maybe in Another Life&lt;/i&gt; raises questions about fate and true love: Is anything meant to be? How much in our life is determined by chance? And perhaps, most compellingly: Is there such a thing as a soul mate?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hannah believes there is. And, in both worlds, she believes she’s found him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s a client. That’s all.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or it should be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with every lesson, she’s becoming more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secrets I’m hiding behind the image of the Gentleman Mentor make telling her the truth—and having anything real—impossible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m training her for another man, and that fact guts me every time I think of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know she’s not mine … but part of me won’t accept that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I willing to risk it all to keep her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He calls himself the Gentleman Mentor.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just reading his ad makes me feel more alive than I have in years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He promises to teach me the art of seduction … and show me the most sinfully erotic pleasures. He’s going to help me become the kind of confident, sexy woman men can’t ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six lessons … with the most gorgeous man … who happens to be a Dom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem … now that I’ve experienced his brand of delectable domination will anyone else ever compare? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;THE GENTLEMAN MENTOR is a full-length standalone novel.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Despite their differences, sisters Vianne and Isabelle have always been close. Younger, bolder Isabelle lives in Paris while Vianne is content with life in the French countryside with her husband Antoine and their daughter. But when the Second World War strikes, Antoine is sent off to fight and Vianne finds herself isolated so Isabelle is sent by their father to help her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war progresses, the sisters' relationship and strength are tested. With life changing in unbelievably horrific ways, Vianne and Isabelle will find themselves facing frightening situations and responding in ways they never thought possible as bravery and resistance take different forms in each of their actions.</description>

And he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with a tormented past, undergraduate Olivia Winter once led a practical but isolated life. Then she met Professor Dean West, a brilliant scholar of medieval history who melted Liv's inhibitions and taught her the meaning of both love and erotic pleasure.

And when dark secrets and temptations rise to the surface, the fallout might break them apart forever.</description>

  <description>At age twenty-one, Auburn Reed has already lost everything important to her. In her fight to rebuild her shattered life, she has her goals in sight and there is no room for mistakes. But when she walks into a Dallas art studio in search of a job, she doesn’t expect to find a deep attraction to the enigmatic artist who works there, Owen Gentry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once, Auburn takes a chance and puts her heart in control, only to discover that Owen is keeping a major secret from coming out. The magnitude of his past threatens to destroy everything important to Auburn, and the only way to get her life back on track is to cut Owen out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save their relationship, all Owen needs to do is confess. But in this case, the confession could be much more destructive than the actual sin.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, girl met boy and a love story began. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their future was assured until tragedy struck and deceptions were made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are consequences to every action, and the Consequences of Deception are always the most punishing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane Evans lost nearly everyone that she’s ever loved, but losing Killian Brandt left a scar that never healed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four and a half years after turning his back on her, Killian steps back into Sloane’s life in the most shocking of ways, giving her no choice but to abandon her life and go with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would a man buy a woman that he hates? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everything is as it appears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is beautiful, revenge is ugly, and lies destroy lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare to discover the Consequences of Deception. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; a sweet and happy romance. It's dark, twisted, and not for the faint of heart. If you prefer champagne, roses &amp;amp; easy romance, this is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; the book for you. 18 &amp;amp; up &lt;b&gt;ONLY&lt;/b&gt; due to erotic content.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jen Lancaster has lived a life based on re-invention and self-improvement. From &lt;i&gt;Bitter Is the New Black&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Tao of Martha&lt;/i&gt;, she’s managed to document her (and her generation’s) attempts to shape up, grow up, and have it all—sometimes with disastrous results…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure Jen has made mistakes. She spent all her money from a high-paying job on shoes, clothes, and spa treatments. She then carried a Prada bag to the unemployment office. She wrote a whole memoir about dieting…but didn’t lose weight. She embarked on a quest for cultural enlightenment that only cemented her love for John Hughes movies and Kraft American Singles. She tried to embrace everything Martha Stewart, while living with a menagerie of rescue cats and dogs. (Glitter…&lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistakes are one thing; regrets are another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a girls’ weekend in Savannah makes her realize that she is—yikes!—middle-aged (binge watching is so the new binge drinking), Jen decides to make a bucket list and seize the day, even if that means having her tattoo removed at one hundred times the cost of putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From attempting a juice cleanse to studying Italian, from learning to ride a bike to starting a new business, and from sampling pasta in Rome to training for a 5K, Jen is turning a mid-life crisis into a mid-life opportunity, sharing her sometimes bumpy—but always hilarious—attempts to better her life…again.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Listening time 10 hours 17 minutes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian Linden is a liar. On the surface, she looks like a brave survivor of a plane crash. But she’s been lying to her family, her friends, and the whole world since rescue helicopters scooped her and her fellow survivor, Dave Hall, off a deserted island in the South Pacific. Missing for almost two years, the castaways are thrust into the spotlight after their rescue, becoming media darlings overnight. But they can’t tell the real story—so they lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public is fascinated by the castaways’ saga, but Lillian and Dave must return to their lives and their spouses. Genevieve Randall—a hard-nosed journalist and host of a news program—isn’t buying it. She suspects Lillian’s and Dave’s explanations about the other crash survivors aren’t true. And now, Genevieve’s determined to get the real story, no matter how many lives it destroys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this intriguing tale of survival, secrets, and redemption, two everyday people thrown together by tragedy must finally face the truth…even if it tears them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling author, Kendall Ryan, comes the third book in the Filthy Beautiful Lies series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pace Drake&lt;/b&gt; loves sex. He knows where to get it, what to say, what to do, and he makes no apologies for satisfying his needs. But when he meets single mom, &lt;b&gt;Kylie Sloan&lt;/b&gt;, he's enthralled by her, and begins to question his standard operating procedure. After all, there's no chase, no mystery when banging a woman in a nightclub bathroom. Kylie's depth and determination make the sloppy, drunken hookups that fill his weekends seem empty and shallow. She's the opposite of the desperate, clingy women he's used to. She doesn’t want or need anyone to take care of her and that only makes him want to care for her more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kylie's trust in men has vanished. The last guy she was with played ding-dong-ditch-it with her uterus and left her with a baby to raise. Now her infant son is the only man she has time for, even if she misses sex and intimacy more than she'd ever admit. Opening her heart up to a younger man who's best known for no-strings-attached sex and his casual lifestyle is probably the worst idea she's ever had. But Pace wants to prove to her there are still a few good guys left, and watching the sweet way he interacts with her baby makes her want to try…but she can really trust that his days of hitting it and quitting it are in his past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Filthy Beautiful Lust is the third book in the Filthy Beautiful Lies series, however it can be read as a standalone novel (no cliffhanger). To understand the full growth and development of the characters, it is recommended that you begin with book 1, Filthy Beautiful Lies.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Colton Drake paid one million dollars for Sophie Evan’s virginity, the last thing he expected was to fall for her – hard – and then to watch her walk away. But when Sophie discovers that Colton has been lying to her, it is going to take more than money to get her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton won’t be deterred. Sophie is his - she just doesn’t know it yet. Can he seal the deal and rock her world so thoroughly she’ll never want to leave again, or is it too late…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highly sexual and emotionally charged, &lt;i&gt;Filthy Beautiful Love&lt;/i&gt; is the provocative conclusion to &lt;i&gt;Filthy Beautiful Lies&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;**Warning: this book contains an addictively filthy alpha male who will dampen your panties and own your days and nights. Proceed at your own risk.**&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet Colton Drake&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why she auctioned off her virginity for a cool mill. Regardless, I’m now the proud new owner of a perfectly intact hymen. A lot of good that will do me. I have certain tastes, certain sexual proclivities. My cock is a bit more discriminatory than most. And training a virgin takes finesse and patience – both of which I lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sophie Evans&lt;/b&gt; has been backed into a corner. With her sister’s life hanging in the balance, the only choice is to claw her way out, even if that means selling her virginity to the highest bidder at an exclusive erotic club. When Colton Drake takes her home, she quickly learns nothing is as it seems with this beautifully troubled man. Being with him poses challenges she never expected, and pushes her to want things she never anticipated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sinfully seductive erotic romance where everything has a price and the cost of love is the highest of all from New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling author, Kendall Ryan.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A year in the whirlwind life of the beloved pop icon Andy Cohen, in his own cheeky, candid, and irreverent words&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a TV Producer and host of the smash late night show &lt;i&gt;Watch What Happens Live&lt;/i&gt;, Andy Cohen has a front row seat to an exciting world not many get to see. In this dishy, detailed diary of one year in his life, Andy goes out on the town, drops names, hosts a ton of shows, becomes codependent with &lt;i&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/i&gt;, makes trouble, calls his mom, drops some more names, and, while searching for love, finds it with a dog. We learn everything from which celebrity peed in her WWHL dressing room to which Housewives are causing trouble and how. Nothing is off limits - including dating. We see Andy at home and with close friends and family (including his beloved and unforgettable mom). Throughout, Andy tells us not only what goes down, but exactly what he thinks about it. Inspired by the diaries of another celebrity-obsessed Andy (Warhol), this honest, irreverent, and laugh-out-loud funny book is a one-of-a-kind account of the whos and whats of pop culture in the 21st century.</description>

  <description>In bestseller Elin Hilderbrand's first Christmas novel, a family gathers on Nantucket for a holiday filled with surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelley Quinn is the owner of Nantucket's Winter Street Inn and the proud father of four, all of them grown and living in varying states of disarray. Patrick, the eldest, is a hedge fund manager with a guilty conscience. Kevin, a bartender, is secretly sleeping with a French housekeeper named Isabelle. Ava, a school teacher, is finally dating the perfect guy but can't get him to commit. And Bart, the youngest and only child of Kelley's second marriage to Mitzi, has recently shocked everyone by joining the Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Christmas approaches, Kelley is looking forward to getting the family together for some quality time at the inn. But when he walks in on Mitzi kissing Santa Claus (or the guy who's playing Santa at the inn's annual party), utter chaos descends. With the three older children each reeling in their own dramas and Bart unreachable in Afghanistan, it might be up to Kelley's ex-wife, nightly news anchor Margaret Quinn, to save Christmas at the Winter Street Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the mulled cider is gone, the delightfully dysfunctional Quinn family will survive a love triangle, an unplanned pregnancy, a federal crime, a small house fire, many shots of whiskey, and endless rounds of Christmas caroling, in this heart-warming novel about coming home for the holidays.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? &lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sparkling debut novel in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Friday Night Knitting Club&lt;/i&gt;, centered around a Midwestern vintage clothing shop and a group of women who eventually transform the store and each others' lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Hourglass Vintage in Madison, Wisconsin, every item in the boutique has a story to tell . . . and so do the women who are drawn there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yellow Samsonite suitcase with ivory, quilted lining, 1950s...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet Turner had always dreamed of owning a shop like Hourglass Vintage. Though she knows the personal history behind each precious item she sells, Violet refuses to acknowledge her own past. When she is faced with the possibility of losing the store, she realizes that, as much as she wants to, she cannot save it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taffeta tea length wedding gown with scooped neckline and cap sleeves, 1952...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old April Morgan is nearly five months along in an unplanned pregnancy when her hasty engagement is broken. When she returns the perfect 1950s wedding dress, she discovers unexpected possibilities and friends who won't let her give up on her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Orange sari made from silk dupioni with gold paisley design, 1968...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayed by her husband, Amithi Singh begins selling off her old clothes, remnants of her past life. After decades of housekeeping and parenting a daughter who rejects her traditional ways, she fears she has nothing more ahead for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An engaging story that beautifully captures the essence of women's friendship and love, &lt;i&gt;Vintage&lt;/i&gt; is a charming tale of possibility, of finding renewal and hope when we least expect it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br /&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor&lt;/i&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Park&lt;/i&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

  <description>Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local "powhitetrash." At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ("I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Poetic and powerful, &lt;i&gt;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&lt;/i&gt; will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.</description>

  <description>From the author of the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;What Alice Forgot &lt;/i&gt;comes a breakout new novel about the secrets husbands and wives keep from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Darling Cecilia&lt;br /&gt;If you're reading this, then I've died . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret - something so terrible it would destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others too. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick achieved it all - she's an incredibly successful business woman, a pillar of her small community and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia - or each other - but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband's devastating secret.</description>

  <description>A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her eagerly awaited new novel, beloved &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Emily Giffin returns with an extraordinary story of love and loyalty—and an unconventional heroine struggling to reconcile both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirty-three-year-old Shea Rigsby has spent her entire life in Walker, Texas—a small college town that lives and dies by football, a passion she unabashedly shares. Raised alongside her best friend, Lucy, the daughter of Walker’s legendary head coach, Clive Carr, Shea was too devoted to her hometown team to leave. Instead she stayed in Walker for college, even taking a job in the university athletic department after graduation, where she has remained for more than a decade.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when an unexpected tragedy strikes the tight-knit Walker community, Shea’s comfortable world is upended, and she begins to wonder if the life she’s chosen is really enough for her. As she finally gives up her safety net to set out on an unexpected path, Shea discovers unsettling truths about the people and things she has always trusted most—and is forced to confront her deepest desires, fears, and secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thoughtful, funny, and brilliantly observed, &lt;i&gt;The One &amp;amp; Only&lt;/i&gt; is a luminous novel about finding your passion, following your heart, and, most of all, believing in something bigger than yourself . . . the one and only thing that truly makes life worth living.</description>

  <description>Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier. &lt;br /&gt; The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In middle age, Annie Oh—wife, mother, and outsider artist—has shaken her family to its core. After twenty-seven years of marriage and three children, Annie has fallen in love with Viveca, the wealthy, cultured, confident Manhattan art dealer who orchestrated her professional success.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie and Viveca plan to wed in the Oh family's hometown of Three Rivers, Connecticut, where gay marriage has recently been legalized. But the impending wedding provokes some very mixed reactions and opens a Pandora's box of toxic secrets—dark and painful truths that have festered below the surface of the Ohs' lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are Water&lt;/em&gt; is an intricate and layered portrait of marriage, family, and the inexorable need for understanding and connection, told in the alternating voices of the Ohs—nonconformist Annie; her ex-husband, Orion, a psychologist; Ariane, the do-gooder daughter, and her twin, Andrew, the rebellious only son; and free-spirited Marissa, the youngest Oh. Set in New England and New York during the first years of the Obama presidency, it is also a portrait of modern America, exploring issues of class, changing social mores, the legacy of racial violence, and the nature of creativity and art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor and breathtaking compassion, Wally Lamb brilliantly captures the essence of human experience in vivid and unforgettable characters struggling to find hope and redemption in the aftermath of trauma and loss. &lt;em&gt;We Are Water&lt;/em&gt; is vintage Wally Lamb—a compulsively readable, generous, and uplifting masterpiece that digs deep into the complexities of the human heart to explore the ways in which we search for love and meaning in our lives.</description>

  <description>What happens when you think you have it all, and then suddenly it’s taken away?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willa Chandler-Golden's father changed the world with his self-help bestseller, Is It Really Your Choice? Why Your Entire Life May Be Out of Your Control. Millions of devoted fans now find solace in his notion that everything happens for a reason. Though Willa isn’t entirely convinced of her father’s theories, she readily admits that the universe has delivered her a solid life: a reliable husband, a fast-paced career. Sure there are hiccups – negative pregnancy tests, embattled siblings - but this is what the universe has brought, and life, if she doesn’t think about it too much, is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then her (evidently not-so-reliable) husband proposes this: A two-month break. Two months to see if they can't live their lives without each other. And before Willa can sort out destiny and fate and what it all means, she’s axed from her job, her 12 year-old nephew Nicky moves in, her ex-boyfriend finds her on Facebook, and her best friend Vanessa lands a gig writing for Dare You!, the hottest new reality TV show. And then Vanessa lures Willa into dares of her own - dares that run counter to her father’s theories of fate, dares that might change everything…but only if Willa is brave enough to stop listening to the universe and instead aim for the stars.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE REALITY BEHIND REALITY TV; HOLLYWOOD'S FAVORITE MOM-STAR TELLS IT LIKE IT IS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tori Spelling is the first to admit that the reality behind her popular television show, &lt;i&gt;Tori &amp;amp; Dean, &lt;/i&gt;isn't always real. Not even &lt;i&gt;Star Magazine &lt;/i&gt;could invent the true chaos that happens behind the scenes. Luckily, Tori is famously honest and self-deprecatingly funny when it comes to her personal life. She's always &lt;i&gt;Spelling It Like It Is.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is never boring at Tori's house, but since her &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling memoirs &lt;i&gt;sTORI Telling, Mommywood, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Uncharted terriTORI, &lt;/i&gt;things have been especially unpredictable: Finding out she was pregnant with her third baby after nearly vomiting live on the Home Shopping Network; trying to hide her fourth pregnancy so soon after giving birth (as her stylist said, who would be that crazy?); being rescued from a paparazzo by a mom lynch mob; stalking her celebrity neighbor; and allowing cameras to film every personal detail of her life from the most challenging time in her marriage to the only time in six years when she really felt as though those cameras invaded her privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tori shares these stories and many more with the usual humor, candor, and down-to-earth charm that her fans love. She also writes openly about her biggest challenges: the terrifying health problems surrounding her high-risk pregnancy with youngest son Finn, her guilt over missing baby Hattie's early months because she was in the hospital on bed rest, her struggles (and failures) to live within her means after growing up in opulence, discovering how much she has in common with her late mega-producer father, Aaron Spelling, and falling in love with Dean all over again (hint: it didn't happen at their vow renewal ceremony).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of intimately revealing her everyday antics onscreen, Tori's life is still full of surprises. Slowing down long enough to enjoy them? Now that's another sTORI.</description>

One wild night in a Vegas hotel changed everything for Kasie. Sleeping with a powerful, sexy stranger made her rethink her impending marriage, and a whole lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her affair threatens her job and the sexy billionaire Robert Dade becomes more controlling, Kasie has to figure out if her passion is leading her down a path she really wants. She’s seduced by his gifts of power, success, and adventure, she’s overwhelmed by what he can make her feel with a single touch, the way he can make her ache for him with just a look. But is the cost of absolute power and pleasure a price Kasie can afford? And does she truly know this man who says he can give her everything…or is he still a stranger after all?</description>

One passionate night with a stranger turned Kasie’s world upside down, and just when she thought she was getting the hang of things, her fiancé finds out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should sleep with a stranger—those words whispered in her ear by her best friend became a challenge Kasie took to heart. Suddenly, the man who gave her the most shocking pleasure in that upscale Vegas hotel—a man whose name she never bothered to find out—is her company’s biggest client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this unknown man becomes Mr. Dade at the office, and Mr. Dade becomes Robert in the bedroom, Kasie discovers her true nature and begins to question the carefully controlled, modest image she has crafted to please her family and friends. But when her fiancé, Dave, finds out, his rage and desire to both keep her and punish her could cost her everything—including Robert, the only man who has wanted Kasie for who she really is and the only man who makes her feel truly alive.</description>

  <description>This book is no longer sold separately but included in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571567.Just_One_Night" title="Just One Night" rel="nofollow"&gt;Just One Night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling erotic enovella trilogy, a buttoned-up businesswoman takes her friend’s advice and has a fling with a stranger on a trip to Vegas—only to find herself under his mysterious, sexy power both in the boardroom and the bedroom. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kasie Fitzgerald knows who she’s supposed to be. She’s a rising-star-workaholic at a global consulting firm. She’s the fiancée of a well-connected man who’s won the approval of her parents. People know that she’s reliable, serious, proper, cautious, pragmatic, and yes, a little predictable. She’s who Dave and her family &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; her to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as her thirtieth birthday looms, buried feelings begin to resurrect. Her friend takes her to Vegas for one last wild and crazy night. In a dress much shorter and sexier than anything she has ever dared to wear before, she hits the blackjack tables. And meets &lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt; Under the tailored clothes it’s clear that this is a man who is intense, powerful, and maybe even a little dangerous. With a touch of trepidation she accepts his invitation to get a drink, and before long, she’s in his hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never gets his full name. Perhaps his anonymity is one of the reasons she’s able to give herself over to him and to the moment so completely&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Perhaps it’s why she’s just had the most exquisite and passionate sex of her life. Shaken by her own behavior, Kasie tries to chalk it up to one crazy night. But when the mysterious gentleman she’s just had a fling with shows up in her office—as the CEO of a firm her company does a billion dollars of business with a year, demanding that &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; handle his account, and so much more—things will never be the same again. And there’s no telling where this will go…</description>

  <description>Mary Kay Ash, one of America's most dynamic businesswomen, lived her life with simple and timeless principles. Through her uncomplicated formula for success -- God first, family second and career third -- she achieved her dream.She inspired. She motivated. She cared. Mary Kay often said that if you expect great things, great things will happen. So expect results. Expect success. Miracles happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay Ash knew when she created her dream company that its success would largely depend on the principles upon which it was founded. In her wisdom, she realized that by building a solid foundation, and never wavering from it, she would distinguish her company and set the stage for women to succeed for decades to come. Mary Kay herself said, "The Company bears my name, but it has a life of its own. The true success is the lives that have changed for the better." Today, the independent sales force wholeheartedly embraces Mary Kay's vision of enriching women's lives. Because she believed that women would understand and support her mission, her legacy will continue to grow, inspiring generations of women around the world to believe that miracles happen.</description>

  <description>The Carmichaels and Grahams have gathered on Nantucket for a wedding. Plans are being made according to the wishes of the bride s late mother, who left behind the notebook: specific instructions for every detail of her youngest daughter s future nuptials. Everything should be falling into place for the beautiful event but in reality, things are far from perfect. While the couple-to-be are quite happy, their loved ones find their own lives crumbling. In the days leading up to the wedding, love will be questioned, scandals will arise, and hearts will be broken and healed. Elin Hilderbrand takes readers on a touching journey in "Beautiful Day" into the heart of marriage, what it means to be faithful, and how we choose to honor our commitments. "</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this hilarious and inspirational memoir, Ross Mathews-best known as "Ross the Intern" from The Tonight Show with Jay Leno-chronicles his life growing up as an atypical kid in a small Northwestern farm town to living as an atypical adult in Los Angeles, to eventually being his loud, proud, apologetically genuine self on national television.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a young kid growing up in a farm town, Ross Mathews might as well have wished for a pet unicorn or a calorie-free cookie tree to grow in his front yard. Either of those far-fetched fantasies would have been more likely to come true than his real dream: working in television in Hollywood, California. Seriously, that stuff just doesn't happen to people like Ross. But guess what? It totally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with his first book, Ross takes us inside his journey as a super-fan, revealing the most embarrassing and hilarious moments of his small-town life and big-city adventures. From learning to swear like a hardened trucker to that time in high school when had to face down the most frightening opponent of all (his girlfriend's lady bits), Ross holds nothing back. Oh, then there's his surprisingly shady past involving the cutest pair of plus-sized women's pajama bottoms, deliciously dangerous pot butter, and embezzled sandwiches. And, of course, how he's managed to turn an obsession with pop-culture into one-on-one interactions with celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Tiffani-Amber Theissen, Madonna, Michelle Kwan, and countless more without ever having a single restraining order issued against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infused with Ross's trademark humor, unique voice, and total honesty, &lt;i&gt;Man Up!&lt;/i&gt; is a mission statement for anyone who doesn't fit the mold. His hasn't been the most traditional way to build a career in Hollywood, but Ross has somehow managed to make his mark without ever compromising who he is. He is as serious about this as he is about Golden Girls trivia: You don't need to change who you are to achieve your dreams (although there's nothing wrong with a makeover every now and then). You just need to Man Up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One would think that with Jen Lancaster’s impressive list of bestselling self-improvement memoirs—Bitter Is the New Black; Bright Lights, Big Ass; Such a Pretty Fat; Pretty in Plaid; My Fair Lazy; and Jeneration X—that she would have it all together by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen’s still a little rough around the edges. Suffice it to say, she’s no Martha Stewart. And that is exactly why Jen is going to Martha up and live her life according to the advice of America’s overachieving older sister—the woman who turns lemons into lavender-infused lemonade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By immersing herself in Martha’s media empire, Jen will embark on a yearlong quest to take herself, her house, her husband (and maybe even her pets) to the next level—from closet organization to craft making, from party planning to kitchen prep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Jen can go four days without giving herself food poisoning if she follows Martha’s dictates on proper storage....Maybe she can grow closer to her girlfriends by taking up their boring-ass hobbies like knitting and sewing.…Maybe she can finally rid her workout clothes of meatball stains by using Martha’s laundry tips.… Maybe she can create a more meaningful anniversary celebration than just getting drunk in the pool with her husband....again. And maybe, just maybe, she’ll discover that the key to happiness does, in fact, lie in Martha’s perfectly arranged cupboards and artfully displayed charcuterie platters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe not.</description>

  <description>From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn't resist. I saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside--so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I'd been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A major new talent tackles the complicated terrain of sisters, the power of books, and the places we decide to call home. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no problem that a library card can't solve. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Andreas family is one of readers. Their father, a renowned Shakespeare professor who speaks almost entirely in verse, has named his three daughters after famous Shakespearean women. When the sisters return to their childhood home, ostensibly to care for their ailing mother, but really to lick their wounds and bury their secrets, they are horrified to find the others there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;See, we love each other. We just don't happen to like each other very much.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the sisters soon discover that everything they've been running from -- one another, their small hometown, and themselves -- might offer more than they ever expected.</description>

  <description>This is the heart-wrenching true story of a girl named Cupcake and it begins when, aged eleven, she is orphaned and placed in the 'care' of sadistic foster parents. But there comes a point in her preteen years - maybe it's the night she first tries to run away and is exposed to drugs, alcohol, and sex all at once - when Cupcake's story shifts from a tear-jerking tragedy to a dark, deeply disturbing journey through hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cupcake learned to survive by turning tricks, downing hard liquor and ingesting every drug she could find while hitchhiking up and down the California coast. At just 16 she stumbled into the terrifying world of the gangsta, dealing drugs, hustling and only just surviving a drive-by shooting. Ironically, it was Cupcake's rapid descent into the nightmare of crack cocaine addiction that finally saved her. After one four-day crack binge she woke up behind a dumpster. Half-dressed and half-dead, she finally realized she had to change her life or die on the streets - another trash-can addict, another sad statistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astonishingly, Cupcake turned her life around and this is her brutally frank, startlingly funny story. Unlike any memoir you will ever read, &lt;i&gt;A Piece of Cake&lt;/i&gt; is a redemptive, gripping tale of a resilient spirit who took on the worst of contemporary urban life and survived it. It is also the most genuinely affecting rollercoaster ride through hell and back that you will ever take.</description>

  <description>Touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared "light-skinned" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in "orchestrated chaos" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. "Mommy," a fiercely protective woman with "dark eyes full of pep and fire," herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. "God is the color of water," Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.</description>

  <description>He saw her first, but his friend made the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She settled for the safer choice, but her heart knew the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They love, they crave, they lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garrett McCarthy, Annabelle Parker, and Milo Roberts were as close as friends could get. They shared in each other's joy during graduations, promotions, and engagements. They consoled one another through heartache and loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of the friend's life is tragically cut short, it's up to the two left behind to pick up the pieces and find out the truth - no matter the cost. As they slowly start to uncover the nature of his deception, and the very powerful people behind it, they begin to question everyone and everything, even themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets - some do it for love while others do it for power. Those secrets can change perceptions, alter reality and sometimes destroy lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when you find out your whole life has been a lie?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NY Times&lt;/b&gt; bestseller &lt;b&gt;Jane Green&lt;/b&gt; delivers a riveting novel about two women whose lives intersect when a shocking secret is revealed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;b&gt;Another Piece of My Heart&lt;/b&gt; comes the gripping story of two women who live on opposite coasts but whose lives are connected in ways they never could have imagined. Both women are wives and mothers to children who are about to leave the nest for school. They're both in their forties and have husbands who travel more than either of them would like. They are both feeling an emptiness neither had expected. But when a shocking secret is exposed, their lives are blown apart. As dark truths from the past reveal themselves, will these two women be able to learn to forgive, for the sake of their children, if not for themselves?</description>

  <description>Some stories live forever . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage Singer is a baker. She works through the night, preparing the day’s breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother’s death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage’s grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others can’t, and they become companions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret—one that nobody else in town would ever suspect—and asks Sage for an extraordinary favor. If she says yes, she faces not only moral repercussions, but potentially legal ones as well. With her own identity suddenly challenged, and the integrity of the closest friend she’s ever had clouded, Sage begins to question the assumptions and expectations she’s made about her life and her family. When does a moral choice become a moral imperative? And where does one draw the line between punishment and justice, forgiveness and mercy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this searingly honest novel, Jodi Picoult gracefully explores the lengths we will go in order to protect our families and to keep the past from dictating the future</description>

  <description>Escaping a cheating ex, finance whiz Sara Dillon’s moved to New York City and is looking for excitement and passion without a lot of strings attached. So meeting the irresistible, sexy Brit at a dance club should have meant nothing more than a night’s fun. But the manner—and speed—with which he melts her inhibitions turns him from a one-time hookup and into her Beautiful Stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole city knows that Max Stella loves women, not that he’s ever found one he particularly wants to keep around. Despite pulling in plenty with his Wall Street bad boy charm, it’s not until Sara—and the wild photos she lets him take of her—that he starts wondering if there’s someone for him outside of the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooking up in places where anybody could catch them, the only thing scarier for Sara than getting caught in public is having Max get too close in private.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brandi Glanville may be the newest bad girl in Beverly Hills, but it’s impossible not to love her for always speaking her mind. In this brash, candid, and vulnerable memoir, she spills all of her secrets, dishing on her infamous divorce, motherhood, the plastic surgery that made her “seventeen” again, and much, much more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the brutally honest breath of fresh air on &lt;i&gt;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, &lt;/i&gt;known for her dramatic divorce, her barely-there clothing, and her inability to keep her mouth shut. So why should she change now? Brandi Glanville tells all in this hilarious, no-holds-barred memoir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans have been waiting for Brandi’s scoop on one of the biggest divorces of the decade, since her husband of eight years abandoned her and their two sons to marry country singer LeAnn Rimes. Not only does Brandi spill the beans about her side of the split, the lovable housewife shares the incredible wild ride that took her from a life in the ghetto to Hollywood’s most elite circles. For the first time, Brandi talks about how she escaped a rough neighborhood on the outskirts of Sacramento and stumbled into a successful modeling career that swept her into a world of Paris Fashion Weeks, private jets, and uncircumcised penises. Before she knew it, Brandi was the perfect Hollywood trophy wife—at least until her marriage exploded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the refreshingly filter-free housewife and unapologetic mom is the newest full-time cast member of Bravo’s juggernaut franchise, where she often elicits raised eyebrows and gossip from her costars for her refusal to be the scorned ex-wife, to be bullied, to change her sarcastic sense of humor, or—on most occasions—to wear a bra. Sassy, raunchy, and compulsively readable, &lt;i&gt;Drinking and Tweeting &lt;/i&gt;perfectly captures Brandi’s open-book attitude, as she dishes about everything from her DUI, her cheating ex, her one-night stands, and the secret plastic surgery that made her “seventeen” again. You’re sure to enjoy every page of this funny, upbeat, honest tale. Clear your schedule for an afternoon and grab your favorite cocktail, a comfy seat . . . and maybe a Xanax. But that’s for later.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An ambitious intern. A perfectionist executive. And a whole lot of name calling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan. He's exacting, blunt, inconsiderate—and completely irresistible. A Beautiful Bastard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocative—completely infuriating—creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rules—or outright smash them—if it means he can have her. All over the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their appetites for one another increase to a breaking point, Bennett and Chloe must decide exactly what they're willing to lose in order to win each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally only available online as &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; by tby789 — and garnering over 2 million reads on fanfiction sites — &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard&lt;/i&gt; has been extensively updated for re-release.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Resilient and practical, Kara Barton has continually strived to live a respectable life. She went to college, embarked on a promising career as an attorney, married a great guy, and always appeared to be the perfect wife and mother. But all is not what it seems, and the troubling past Kara has been running from her entire life is about to catch up with her. Urged on by her insecurities about growing older, and desperately wanting to feel one more night of passion, Kara agrees to share a tryst in a hotel room with a sexy business associate, Scott Ellsworth. But Scott wants more than one night together, and Kara quickly discovers it is impossible to resist him. Soon Kara finds herself transformed into the kind of woman she vowed never to become, and the secure world she has struggled all her life to build begins to fall apart. Kara Barton is about to find out how a one-night stand can change everything.</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett had always been one to think out-of-the-box, who knew she wanted something more in life than following the same repetitive patterns and growing old with the same repetitive life story. And she thought that her life was going in the right direction until everything fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined not to dwell on the negative and push forward, Camryn is set to move in with her best friend and plans to start a new job. But after an unexpected night at the hottest club in downtown North Carolina, she makes the ultimate decision to leave the only life she’s ever known, far behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a purse, a cell phone and a small bag with a few necessities, Camryn, with absolutely no direction or purpose boards a Greyhound bus alone and sets out to find herself. What she finds is a guy named Andrew Parrish, someone not so very different from her and who harbors his own dark secrets. But Camryn swore never to let down her walls again. And she vowed never to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with Andrew, Camryn finds herself doing a lot of things she never thought she’d do. He shows her what it’s really like to live out-of-the-box and to give in to her deepest, darkest desires. On their sporadic road-trip he becomes the center of her exciting and daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But will Andrew’s dark secret push them inseparably together, or tear them completely apart?</description>

  <description>To want what you’re not supposed to have…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is only nineteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is his new stepfather’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits. His famous father’s guilt money, his mother’s desperation to win his love, and his charm are the three reasons he has never been told no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama, after her mother passed away, to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida gulf coast. She isn’t prepared for the lifestyle change and she knows she’ll never fit into this world. Then there is her sexy stepbrother who her father leaves her with for the summer while he runs off to Paris with his wife. Rush is as spoiled as he is gorgeous. He is also getting under her skin. She knows he is anything but good for her and that he’ll never be faithful to anyone. He is jaded and has secrets Blaire knows she may never uncover but even knowing all of that…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaire just may have fallen too far.</description>

  <description>If you don’t have anything nice to say about motherhood, then… read this book. Robin O’Bryant offers a no holds barred look at the day to day life of being a mother to three, running a household and the everyday monotony of parenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not always pretty but it’s real. Whether she's stuffing cabbage in her bra… dealing with defiant yet determined daughters… yelling at the F.B.I... or explaining the birds and the bees to her preschooler… you’re sure to find dozens of humorous and relatable situations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the creator of Robin's Chicks, one of the South’s most popular blogs on motherhood, misunderstandings and musings, comes a collection of essays that will not only make you laugh and cry, but realize that you’re not alone in your journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sit back and relax, pour yourself some “mommy juice,” throw a fresh diaper on your baby and deadbolt the bedroom door to keep your kids out… because once you start reading you'll be too busy wiping away tears of laughter to wipe anybody's butt.</description>

  <description>The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed. Suddenly, Caroline is finding she may have discovered a whole new definition of neighborly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a delicious mix of silly and steamy, Alice Clayton dishes out a hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight...</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.</description>

  <description>Carina Conte has had a crush on her brother Michael’s best friend, Max Gray, since she was a teenager. Now she’s earned her MBA and come to work at Michael’s new venture, America’s fastest-growing bakery empire. But some things never change: her family still treats her like a child. With three drop-dead gorgeous siblings, she’s still the ugly duckling of the bunch. And Max, the company’s new CEO, still barely notices her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max knows Carina Conte is strictly off limits. But hot-blooded lust wins out at a conference when the two share a scorching one-night stand—and are busted by her mother! Now, forced by old-world Italian tradition into a marriage he’s not ready for, Max is miserable—and Carina is furious. Her new husband is about to realize that hell hath no fury like a woman transformed….</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once, a long time ago, I walked down a night-darkened road called Firefly Lane, all alone, on the worst night of my life, and I found a kindred spirit. That was our beginning. More than thirty years ago. TullyandKate. You and me against the world. Best friends forever. But stories end, don’t they? You lose the people you love and you have to find a way to go on. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tully Hart has always been larger than life, a woman fueled by big dreams and driven by memories of a painful past. She thinks she can overcome anything until her best friend, Kate Ryan, dies. Tully tries to fulfill her deathbed promise to Kate--to be there for Kate’s children -- but Tully knows nothing about family or motherhood or taking care of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Marah Ryan is devastated by her mother’s death. Her father, Johnny, strives to hold the family together, but even with his best efforts, Marah becomes unreachable in her grief. Nothing and no one seems to matter to her . . . until she falls in love with a young man who makes her smile again and leads her into his dangerous, shadowy world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Hart--the woman who once called herself Cloud--is at the center of Tully’s tragic past. She repeatedly abandoned her daughter, Tully, as a child, but now she comes back, drawn to her daughter’s side at a time when Tully is most alone. At long last, Dorothy must face her darkest fear: Only by revealing the ugly secrets of her past can she hope to become the mother her daughter needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single, tragic choice and a middle-of-the-night phone call will bring these women together and set them on a poignant, powerful journey of redemption. Each has lost her way, and they will need one another--and maybe a miracle--to transform their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An emotionally complex, heart-wrenching novel about love, motherhood, loss, and new beginnings, &lt;i&gt;Fly Away&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that where there is life, there is hope, and where there is love, there is forgiveness.</description>

Land dream job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piece of cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kate Sandford lands an interview for her favourite music magazine, The Line, it's the chance of a lifetime. So Kate goes out to celebrate – and shows up still drunk to the interview the next morning. No surprise, she doesn't get the job, but the editors at the magazine think she might be perfect for another assignment for their sister gossip rag. All Kate has to do is follow 'It Girl' Amber Sheppard into rehab. If she can get the inside scoop, they'll reconsider her for the position. Kate takes the assignment, but when real friendships start to develop, she has to decide if what she has to gain is worth the price she'll have to pay.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former piano prodigy Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone learning about her past and to make the boy who took everything from her—her identity, her spirit, her will to live—pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Bennett’s story is no secret: every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding—or if he even wants to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sea of Tranquility&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, intense, and brilliantly imagined story about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the miracle of second chances.</description>

With no intention of being tied down, Michael “proposes” to fiery, free-spirited photographer Maggie Ryan: if she will play the part of his fiancée during her trip to Milan for a photo shoot, he will keep away from her married best friend, Alexa, and stop making Maggie nuts with their too-close-for- comfort flirtations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once in Italy, sexual tension sparks the hottest no-strings- attached arrangement on any continent. Could marriage be the most enticing trap of all?</description>

  <description>A marriage in name only...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her family home, impulsive bookstore owner, Alexa Maria McKenzie, casts a love spell. But she never planned on conjuring up her best friend's older brother—the powerful man who once shattered her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billionaire Nicholas Ryan doesn’t believe in marriage, but in order to inherit his father’s corporation, he needs a wife and needs one fast. When he discovers his sister’s childhood friend is in dire financial straits, he offers Alexa a bold proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A marriage in name only with certain rules: Avoid entanglement. Keep things all business. Do not fall in love. The arrangement is only for a year so the rules shouldn’t be that hard to follow, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except fate has a way of upsetting the best-laid plans…</description>

  <description>Sophie Morgan is an independent woman in her thirties with a successful journalism career. Intelligent, witty and sarcastic, she could be the girl next door. Except that Sophie is a submissive; in the bedroom she likes to relinquish her power and personal freedom to a dominant man for their mutual pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of Fifty Shades of Grey, here is a memoir that offers the real story of what it means to be a submissive. From the endorphin rush of her first encounter right through to punishments the likes of which she couldn't begin to imagine, she explains in frank and explicit fashion the road she travels. But it isn't until she meets James that her boundaries are really pushed. As her relationship with him travels into darker and darker places the question becomes: where will it end? Can she reconcile her sexuality with the rest of her life and is it possible for the perfect man to also be perfectly cruel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racy, controversial, but always warm, fun and astoundingly honest this is a fascinating and thought provoking look at a seemingly paradoxical side to human nature and sexuality that no man or woman will be able to put down.</description>

  <description>Jocelyn Butler has been hiding from her past for years. But all her secrets are about to be laid bare ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, Jocelyn left her tragic past behind in the States and started over in Scotland, burying her grief, ignoring her demons, and forging ahead without attachments. Her solitary life is working well - until she moves into a new apartment on Dublin Street, where she meets a man who shakes her carefully guarded world to its core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braden Carmichael is used to getting what he wants, and he's determined to get Jocelyn into his bed. Knowing how skittish she is about entering a relationship, Braden proposes an arrangement that will satisfy their intense attraction without any strings attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after an intrigued Jocelyn accepts, she realizes that Braden won't be satisfied with just mind-blowing passion. The stubborn Scotsman is intent on truly knowing her . . . down to the very soul.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really liked this book. The characters were great and there was just enough drama to keep it from being one of those fairytale type stories. Although the cast of characters was great, we didn't learn too much about a few of them and I think that helped enhance the story. While I normally like t...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her first year away is turning out to be nearly perfect, but one weekend of giving in to heated passion will change everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Harper has grown up under the thumb of her career marine father. Ready to live life her own way and to experience things she's only ever heard of from the jarheads in her father's unit, she's on her way to college at San Diego State University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to her new roommate, Harper is introduced to a world of parties, gorgeous guys, family, and emotions. She finds herself being torn in two as she quickly falls in love with both her new boyfriend, Brandon, and her roommate's brother, Chase. Despite their dangerous looks and histories, both men adore Harper and would do anything for her, including taking a step back if it would mean she'd be happy.</description>

  <description>Carter, Claire and Gavin have formed the perfect little family. Their friends are getting married and everyone is growing up, maturing and ready to face the future. Or are they? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From bachelorette party hell, porn addictions, dinner roll baseball and botched wedding proposals to finding out everyone's extended family is chock full of crazy, Carter and Claire begin to question the strength of the ties that bind them. Unfortunately, these ties have nothing to do with fuzzy handcuffs and everything to do with the mounting differences between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will their friends make a mess of things with their inappropriate comments and need to know everything, or will they convince the couple that happily-ever-after sometimes really can start with beer pong?</description>

  <description>Hilarious new fiction from the New York Times bestselling author of Bitter Is the New Black and If You Were Here .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years after ruling the halls of her suburban Chicago high school, Lissy Ryder doesn't understand why her glory days ended. Back then, she was worshipped...beloved...feared. Present day, not so much. She's been pink-slipped from her high-paying job, dumped by her husband, and kicked out of her condo. Now, at thirty-seven, she's struggling to start a business out of her parents' garage and sleeping under the hair-band posters in her old bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lissy finally realizes karma is the only bitch bigger than she was. Her present is miserable because of her past. But it's not like she can go back in time and change who she was...or can she?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Before there were blogs, there were journals. And in them we’d write as we really were, not as we wanted to appear. But there comes a day when journals outlive us. And with them, our secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer vacation on Great Rock Island was supposed to be a restorative time for Kate, who’d lost her close friend Elizabeth in a sudden accident. But when she inherits a trunk of Elizabeth's journals, they reveal a woman far different than the cheerful wife and mother Kate thought she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complicated portrait of Elizabeth—her troubled upbringing, and her route to marriage and motherhood—makes Kate question not just their friendship, but her own deepest beliefs about loyalty and honesty at a period of uncertainty in her own marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more Kate reads, the more she learns the complicated truth of who Elizabeth really was, and rethinks her own choices as a wife, mother, and professional, and the legacy she herself would want to leave behind. When an unfamiliar man’s name appears in the pages, Kate realizes the extent of what she didn’t know about her friend, including where she was really going on the day she died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the anxious summer after the September 11th attacks, this story of two women—their friendship, their marriages, private ambitions and fears—considers the aspects of ourselves we show and those we conceal, and the repercussions of our choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I loved this bittersweet novel, which manages to be both a compelling mystery and a wise meditation on friendship, marriage and motherhood in an age of great anxiety. Bernier will have you thinking about her characters long after you've turned the final page.”—J. Courtney Sullivan, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He'll teach her the art of seduction...for a price.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed martial arts fighter Reid Andrews’s chance to reclaim his title as light heavyweight champ is shattered when he’s injured only months before the rematch. To make sure he’s healed in time, his trainer sends him to recuperate under a professional’s care—Reid’s best friend’s little sister, all grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disorganized and bookish Lucie Miller needs some professional help of her own. She’d do anything to catch the eye of a doctor she’s crushed on for years, so when Reid offers seduction lessons in exchange for 24/7 conditioning for the biggest fight of his career, Lucie jumps at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Reid finds himself in the fight of his life...winning Lucie's heart before she gives it to someone else.</description>

  <description>A high-spirited novel from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Must Love Dogs&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Life's a Beach&lt;/i&gt; that will have you planning a girlfriend getaway in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Jill Murray's finally figured out how to manage on her own, her ex-husband proves that he can't even run away reliably. After seven long years missing in action, he's back--crashing into the man-free existence Jill and her ten-year-old daughter have built so carefully. And what's a good mother to do? To a child, even a deadbeat dad is better than no dad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill's life just hasn't turned out quite the way she planned. By now, she'd hoped to be jetting around the world as a high-end cultural coach. Instead, she's answering phones for a local travel agency and teaching cooking classes at the community center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter free-spirited entrepreneur Billy, who hires Jill as a consultant for an upcoming business trip. Is their relationship veering off in a new direction And what about her ex Jill couldn't possibly still have feelings for him . . . &lt;i&gt;could she&lt;/i&gt;? Suddenly, her no-boys-allowed life is anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that every seven years you become a completely new person, but Jill isn't sure she's ready for the big change. It takes a Costa Rican getaway to help her make a choice--not so much between the two men in her life, but between the woman she is and the one she wants to be.</description>

  <description>This is an alternate cover edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23016317-seduction-and-snacks" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B008AZTUU8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>The day Preston Drake figured out that wealthy women paid well for a set of tight abs and a pretty face his life turned around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The run down rat-infested trailer he had shared with his alcoholic mother and three younger siblings was now only a place he visited to pay the bills and stock the pantry with food. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He no longer worried about his family starving or living without electricity. The money he made entertaining rich older women more than covered his family’s needs and his own. He had it all figured out. Except…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was this girl.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was as innocent as he was tainted.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amanda Hardy wished her knees didn’t get weak when Preston walked into a room. She hated the fact her heart raced when he flashed his smile in her direction. He had a different girl in his bed every night. He was the kind of boy a smart girl ran from. So, why was she coming up with ways to get close to him? Even when it was obvious he wanted to keep her at a distance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe her heart knew something the world didn’t. Maybe Preston Drake was more than just a pretty face.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Someone’s going to have to let down their guard…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football star Cole Riley is notorious for doing as he pleases—on the field and off. He parties hard and fights harder, but if he doesn’t clean up his act, his career is over—so Cole reluctantly agrees to work with image makeover consultant Savannah Brooks. He’s not used to being told what to do, especially by some (admittedly hot) Southern belle. As for Savannah, she’s not convinced she can transform this cocky (and aggressively sexy) force of nature. But she’s determined to give it her best shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the sparks start to fly, Savannah lays down the ground rules: no personal complications. If she can turn off the tingle she feels every time Cole gives her a hot stare with his gorgeous baby blues, he can turn off his desire as well. But for two people determined to have it all, a hands-off policy can only last so long before one of them yields.</description>

I will say, this book was different than the first 3 in the series as it took most of the book for the real spice to show! The others rushed it along and with this one, I was left wond...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; If you want to score, you have to get in the game... &lt;/b&gt;The last thing Jenna Riley needs is more sports in her life. While her brothers are off being athletic superstars, she's stuck running the family's sports bar, whether she likes it or not. Then in walks pro hockey stud Tyler Anderson. As much as Jenna would like to go to the boards with him, she's vowed to never fall for a jock-even one as hot as Ty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty, intrigued by the beautiful bar owner, becomes a regular. He senses that Jenna wants to do something more with her life. And as he gains her trust, the passion between them grows, as does Ty's insistence that Jenna should start living for herself. With his encouragement, Jenna starts to believe it, too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, Jenna has to figure out what she wants, what she needs, who she loves, and if she has the passion and pride to take a shot at having it all-including Ty...</description>

  <description>Sports agent Liz Darnell will do anything to win back her number-one client, baseball pro Gavin Riley.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Riding the Night&lt;/i&gt; comes an erotic story about love and the games people play. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The last thing event planner Tara Lincoln needs is the jet-set lifestyle of a football pro like Mick Riley; even though their steamy and passionate one-night stand proved that Mick is an all-star-both on the field and in the bedroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tara played the game of love once and lost big, and she doesn't intend to put herself out there again, especially with a certified heartbreaker. But when Mick sets his mind to win, nothing will stop him. And he has the perfect play in mind to catch this sultry vixen.</description>

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>Blockbuster #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner returns with an irresistible story about a young woman trying to make it in Hollywood…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-three, Ruth Saunders headed west with her seventy-year-old grandma in tow, hoping to be hired as a television writer. Four years later, she’s hit the jackpot when she gets The Call: the sitcom she wrote, The Next Best Thing, has gotten the green light, and Ruthie’s going to be the show-runner. But her dreams of Hollywood happiness are threatened by demanding actors, number-crunching executives, an unrequited crush on a boss, and her grandmother’s impending nuptials. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the fascinating backdrop of Los Angeles show business culture, with an insider’s ear and eye for writer’s rooms, bad behavior backstage and set politics, Jennifer Weiner’s new novel is a rollicking ride on the Hollywood rollercoaster and a heartfelt story about what it’s like for a young woman to love, and lose, in the land where dreams come true.</description>

      <![CDATA[I went into this book with such high hopes that Ms. Weiner would get back to the writing she used do. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I thought the main character, Ruth, whined too much. We get it already, move forward and quit whining about the same thing. This happened up until the very e...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie has no desire to meet the members of the rock band, Sole Regret, but her groupie of a best friend gets them both backstage and then rushes off with the band’s lead singer. Left alone at an after party with a bunch of scary tattooed and pierced metal-heads, sheltered Melanie is relieved when the only normal-looking guy in the room insists on keeping her company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time Melanie discovers that Gabe is the band’s drummer and not as normal as she assumed, she has already made a complete fool of herself. She can’t help but be interested in him, not as a rock star, but as the sexiest man she’s ever encountered. Strangely attracted to his hidden tattoos and body piercing, she wonders what it would be like to spend a night with a bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie there’s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and a hot rock star with a naughty and inventive mind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gabe and Melanie's story continues in&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 6: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17832488.Tell_Me" title="Tell Me" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tell Me&lt;/a&gt; and Book 11: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490402.Trust_Me" title="Trust Me" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trust Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released).</description>

  <description>In her best-selling debut, Commencement, J. Courtney Sullivan explored the complicated and contradictory landscape of female friendship. Now, in her highly anticipated second novel, Sullivan takes us into even richer territory, introducing four unforgettable women who have nothing in common but the fact that, like it or not, they’re family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Kellehers, Maine is a place where children run in packs, showers are taken outdoors, and old Irish songs are sung around a piano. Their beachfront property, won on a barroom bet after the war, sits on three acres of sand and pine nestled between stretches of rocky coast, with one tree bearing the initials “A.H.” At the cottage, built by Kelleher hands, cocktail hour follows morning mass, nosy grandchildren snoop in drawers, and decades-old grudges simmer beneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As three generations of Kelleher women descend on the property one summer, each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant, waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep, never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the events of one night, long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns wickedly funny and achingly sad, Maine unveils the sibling rivalry, alcoholism, social climbing, and Catholic guilt at the center of one family, along with the abiding, often irrational love that keeps them coming back, every summer, to Maine and to each other.</description>

  <description>Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she’s never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he’s nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn’t at all who he’s been claiming to be. When the secrets he’s been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky’s life will change forever.</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>Maybe driving home after a few (or more) shots of tequila had been a bad idea, but hell, he did it all the time. The cops had to have been freaking bored to have pulled him over. He wasn’t even swerving! That’s Cage York’s story and he’s sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, his baseball coach isn’t buying it. Cage has a free ride to the local junior college for baseball -- or he did, until he’d gotten a DUI. Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach’s demands and spend his summer baling hay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He’d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she’d received the phone call from Josh’s mother saying he’d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva’s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cage isn’t real happy with his closet-sized bedroom in the back of a foul smelling barn, or his daily interactions with cows, but he knows that if he doesn’t make his coach happy then he can kiss his scholarship goodbye. Only a sick and twisted man would decide his punishment was to be working on a farm all summer. No hot babes in bikinis waiting to meet a Southern boy to make her vacation complete. Just him and the damned cows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh -- and an uptight, snarky brunette with the biggest blue eyes he’s every seen. But she doesn’t count, because as hard as he’s tried to charm her out of her panties - he’s pretty sure she’d rather see him hung from the rafters than let him get a taste of her pretty little lips.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From acclaimed bestseller Jennifer Echols comes a sizzling tale of a young airplane pilot torn between two brothers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was fourteen, I made a decision. If I was doomed to live in a trailer park next to an airport, I could complain about the smell of the jet fuel like my mom, I could drink myself to death over the noise like everybody else, or I could learn to fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Leah Jones, reality is life in a rundown trailer park with an irresponsible mother. But there’s one escape. With an after-school job at the local airstrip, she manages to afford cut-rate flight lessons. At the controls of a small plane, she leaves the trailer park far below, swooping out over the sea in the ultimate rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her senior year of high school, Leah’s dreams come true: she snags a job flying for an aerial banner-advertising business. Then the owner dies suddenly, leaving everything in the hands of his teenage sons: golden boy Alec and adrenaline junkie Grayson. Though Leah has crushed on Grayson for years, she tries to stay clear of the apparently doomed business—until Grayson digs up her most damning secret. Holding it over Leah’s head, he forces her to fly for secret reasons of his own, reasons involving Alec. She’s been drawn into a battle between brothers—and the consequences could be deadly.</description>

  <description>From #1 "New York Times" bestselling author Sylvia Day comes the provocative masterstroke of abandon and obsession that redefined the meaning of desire and became a global phenomenon... &lt;br /&gt; "Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness."&lt;br /&gt; ""&lt;br /&gt; He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily &lt;br /&gt; Gideon "knew." He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each others most private wounds and desires. &lt;br /&gt; The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart "</description>

  <description>Steering clear of relationships has never been difficult for demolitions expert Cole Bowen, but now, with his brother's engagement sending the female population into full-blown hysterics and the town of Alden's month-long festivities helping along, he finds himself in hell. When he discovers Alden's new resident and the object of all his wet dreams, Christine Sheridan, has sworn off relationships and is going to hire a gigolo to get professionally laid, he decides to kill two birds with one stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christy is so not drinking again. Thanks to José Cuervo she has her friends signing her up for stud conventions and Cole frigging Bowen offering sex in exchange of fake dates, which is so out of the question it isn't even funny. She knows the domineering man will push her boundaries, and after battling all her life with self-esteem issues, she isn't ready for that. Too bad he won't take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cole is determined to strip away all of her defenses but refuses to lower his ever-present walls, so when Christy realizes she wants more, she's left with only two options; walk away or crack his shield and risk her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>The first in a new erotic romance series, Backstage Pass is a sizzling mix of sex, love, and rock n' roll&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been months since Brian Sinclair, lead guitarist for the famous rock band, Sinners, composed anything. Unable to write the music that once flowed so naturally, Brian is lost without his musical mojo. But when sexy psychology professor Myrna Evans comes on tour to study groupie mentality, Brian may have found the spark he needs to reignite his musical genius. When lust turns to love, will Brian be able to convince Myrna that what they have is more than just a fling, and that now that he's found his heart's muse, he doesn't want to live without her?</description>

  <description>Madison Daniels has worshiped her brother's best friend since they were kids. Everyone thinks she and Chase Gamble would make the perfect couple, but there are two major flaws in their logic. 1) Chase has sworn off relationships of any kind and 2) after blurring the line between friends and lovers for one night four years ago, they can't stop bickering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Forced together for her brother's wedding getaway, Chase and Madison decide to call a truce for the happy couple. Except all bets are off when they're forced to shack up in a tacky '70s honeymoon suite and survive a multitude of "accidents" as the family tries to prove their "spark" can be used for more than fighting. That is, if they don't strangle each other first...</description>

  <description>When Jacqueline follows her longtime boyfriend to the college of his choice, the last thing she expects is a breakup two months into sophomore year. After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she's single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, and failing a class for the first time in her life. Leaving a party alone, Jacqueline is assaulted by her ex's frat brother. Rescued by a stranger who seems to be in the right place at the right time, she wants nothing more than to forget the attack and that night - but her savior, Lucas, sits on the back row of her econ class, sketching in a notebook and staring at her. Her friends nominate him to be the perfect rebound. When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. Suddenly appearances are everything, and knowing who to trust is anything but easy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Night time is the right time...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwendolyn Kidd has met the man of her dreams. He's hot, he's sexy, and what started as a no-names-exchanged night of passion has blossomed into a year and a half-long pleasure fest. Sure, it's a little strange that he only appears in her bed at night, but Gwen is so sure he's the one, she just can't turn him away... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawk Delgado knows more about Gwen than she could ever imagine. She's gorgeous, headstrong, and skittish about relationships. But Hawk is facing his own demons, demons that keep him from connecting with anyone. Yet when Gwen is drawn into Denver's lethal underground scene, Hawk's protective nature comes out full force. The problem is, when Gwen gets a dose of Hawk's Alpha attitude in the daylight, she's not so sure he's the one anymore....</description>

  <description>*Revised September 2013 - Includes Preview Chapters of REGRETS ONLY!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marci Thompson always knew what life would be like by her 30th birthday. A cozy suburban home, charming husband and two brilliant children. A celebrated career as an established writer, complete with wall-to-wall mahogany shelves and a summer book tour. A life full of adventure with her friends and family by her side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Marci lives alone in 480 square feet of converted motel space next to a punk rock band, hundreds of miles from her friends and family. She works in a temporary accounting assignment that has somehow stretched from two weeks into nine months. And the only bright spot in her life, not to mention the only sex she’s had in two years, is an illicit affair with her married boss, Doug. Thirty is not at all what it is cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the reappearance of a cocktail napkin she hasn’t seen in a decade opens a long-forgotten door, and Marci’s life gets complicated, fast. The lines between right and wrong, fantasy and reality, heartache and happiness are all about to get very blurry, as Marci faces the most difficult choices of her life.</description>

  <description>Delightfully smart and heartbreakingly poignant, Allison Pearson's smash debut novel has exploded onto bestseller lists as "The national anthem for working mothers." Hedge-fund manager, wife, and mother of two, Kate Reddy manages to juggle nine currencies in five time zones and keep in step with the Teletubbies. But when she finds herself awake at 1:37 a.m. in a panic over the need to produce a &lt;i&gt;homemade &lt;/i&gt;pie for her daughter's school, she has to admit her life has become unrecognizable. With panache, wisdom, and uproarious wit, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I Don't Know How She Does It&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;brilliantly dramatizes the dilemma of every working mom.</description>

  <description>Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did You Know?-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Landon is the name of his third son?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Claire Walters has worked for Jason Danvers as his assistant for three years, but he’s never appreciated her as a woman—until the day she jumps out of a cake at his friend’s bachelor party.… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To support her ailing mother, Claire is forced to work a second job at a party-planning company. But when her handsome boss ends up with a front-row seat to the action, she’s mortified—and he’s intrigued. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With Danvers International in the middle of an important merger, Jason asks Claire to accompany him on weekend business trips—and suddenly all her fantasies are coming true. Her outspoken best friend thinks that getting a little “executive attention” will solve everything. But Claire sees more in Jason than just sex. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jason is determined to know how the beautiful, sexy woman in the cake could also be his mousy assistant. The more time they spend together, the more he realizes how much fun it can be to mix business with pleasure. And how much he wants to offer her a happily ever after of her own…. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"Mr. Baylor," the officer said, "have you ever met either of these women?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derrick's mind was numb, but somehow he managed to say, "No. Never."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You're making the ladies nervous, and truthfully, you've got me wondering too--what is your business with this woman?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derrick pried his gaze from the woman's stomach and raised his eyes to hers. "She's having my baby."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, Jill Garrison never daydreamed about having the perfect wedding. Instead, she dreamt about having a baby. Boy or girl, it didn't matter. Unfortunately, her fiancé can't have children. Determined to realize her lifelong dream of having a baby, Jill spends years searching for a company (CryoCorp) that provides high quality donor sperm. Everything is right in Jill's world until her wedding day when her fiancé leaves her at the altar to be humiliated before friends and family. She doesn't waste any time moving from New York City to California to start over. And she keeps her appointment with Cryocorp. She may never have the wedding or the husband, but nothing is going to stop her from having a baby. She's tired of everyone telling her what to do. The baby she's carrying is hers and hers alone. Nobody can take that away from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or can they?</description>

  <description>Wickedly sexy James Bowen is a bad boy of the highest order -- tattoos and attitude included -- which unfortunately ranks way up on Tate's not-a-chance-in-hell list, right there along with skydiving naked over Teheran and juggling Ebola vials just for kicks. But what the heck, she's on holiday, the guy is absolutely irresistible, and she needs to unplug from her life. With her dad and brother gone, Tate is left to deal with the family restaurant, which is fast going down the drain. Her employees are acting out, her boyfriend has bailed out, and her very own private stalker is emailing her to death with lovely threats of doom, fire, and dismemberment. So yeah, maybe a little holiday fling is in order. Strictly sex though, and no follow-up whatsoever once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hadn't counted on her take-charge holiday fling having an opinion of his own and stubbornly sticking around, before &lt;i&gt;and after&lt;/i&gt; the sex, making himself at home in her life. There is definitely more to James than meets her prejudiced eye, and even if she's not ready to look deeper, James isn't prepared to permit her not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content and graphic language.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A skillful blend of pop-culture references, acidic humor, and emotional moments. It will take its rightful place . . . alongside Helen Fielding’s &lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones’s Diary,&lt;/i&gt; Anna Maxted’s &lt;i&gt;Getting Over It, &lt;/i&gt;and Allison Pearson’s &lt;i&gt;I Don’t Know How She Does It&lt;/i&gt;.”—&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has been married to her husband, William, for twenty years.  Though she can still remember the first time they met like it was yesterday, these days she finds herself posting things on Facebook that she used to confide to him. So when she’s invited to participate in an anonymous online survey on marriage and love, she finds that all her longings come pouring out as she dutifully answers questions under the name “Wife 22.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaluating her responses is “Researcher 101,” who seems to listen to her in a way that William hasn’t in a very long time, and before she knows it, she finds herself trying hard not to e-flirt with him. Meanwhile, her elderly father is chatting on Facebook, her fifteen-year-old daughter is tweeting, and everything in her life is turning upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wife 22&lt;/i&gt; is a hilariously funny, profoundly moving, and deeply perceptive novel about the ways we live and love in this technological age, from a dazzling new voice in fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“An LOL Instagram about love in a wired world.”—&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Vibrant, au courant, and hilarious . . . brilliant!”—Adriana Trigiani&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: This edition includes a &lt;i&gt;Wife 22&lt;/i&gt; discussion guide.</description>

  <description>Professor Gabriel Emerson has embarked on a passionate, yet clandestine affair with his former student, Julia Mitchell. Sequestered on a romantic holiday in Italy, he tutors her in the sensual delights of the body and the raptures of sex. But when they return, their happiness is threatened by conspiring students, academic politics, and a jealous ex-lover. When Gabriel is confronted by the university administration, will he succumb to Dante's fate? Or will he fight to keep Julia, his Beatrice, forever? In Gabriel's Rapture, the brilliant sequel to the wildly successful debut novel, Gabriel's Inferno, Sylvain Reynard weaves an exquisite love story that will touch the reader's mind, body, and soul, forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The man behind the &lt;i&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/i&gt; writes about his lifelong love affair with pop culture that brought him from the suburbs of St. Louis to his own television show&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a young age, Andy Cohen knew one thing: He loved television. Not in the way that most kids do, but in an irrepressible, all-consuming, I-want-to-climb-inside-the-tube kind of way. And climb inside he did. Now presiding over Bravo's reality TV empire, he started out as an overly talkative pop culture obsessive, devoted to &lt;i&gt;Charlie's Angels&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All My Children &lt;/i&gt;and to his mother, who received daily letters from Andy at summer camp, usually reminding her to tape the soaps. In retrospect, it's hard to believe that everyone didn't know that Andy was gay; still, he remained in the closet until college. Finally out, he embarked on making a career out of his passion for television. &lt;br /&gt;The journey begins with Andy interviewing his all-time idol Susan Lucci for his college newspaper and ends with him in a job where he has a hand in creating today's celebrity icons. In the witty, no-holds-barred style of his show &lt;i&gt;Watch What Happens Live&lt;/i&gt;, Andy tells tales of absurd mishaps during his ten years at CBS News, hilarious encounters with the heroes and heroines of his youth, and the real stories behind &lt;i&gt;The Real Housewives&lt;/i&gt;. Dishy, funny, and full of heart, &lt;i&gt;Most Talkative&lt;/i&gt; provides a one-of-a-kind glimpse into the world of television, from a fan who grew up watching the screen and is now inside it, both making shows and hosting his own.</description>

  <description>Four-time &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and talk show host Bethenny Frankel makes her fiction debut with the novel &lt;i&gt;Skinnydipping&lt;/i&gt;: “A totally fun, dishy read. This is the kind of book that is perfect to pack in your beach bag” (&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved by countless fans for being devilishly dishy, outrageously funny, and always giving it to us straight, four-time &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bethenny Frankel now makes her fiction debut with the story of Faith Brightstone. Faith is an aspiring actress just out of college who moves to LA determined to have it all: a job on the most popular TV show, a beach house in Malibu, and a gorgeous producer boyfriend. But when reality hits, she finds herself with a gig as a glorified servant, a role that has more to do with T&amp;amp;A than acting, and a dead-end relationship. Finally, Faith decides she’s had enough of La La Land and moves back to New York with just a suitcase and her dog, Muffin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later, Faith has finally found her groove as an entrepreneur and manages to land a spot on a new reality TV show hosted by her idol—the legendary businesswoman and domestic goddess, Sybil Hunter. Diving into the bizarre world of reality TV, Faith’s loud mouth and tell-it-like-it-is style immediately get her in trouble with her fellow contestants, and she learns about betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the show comes to a dramatic close, Faith discovers that the man of her dreams may have just walked into her life. Will she choose fame or love? Or can she have it all?</description>

      <![CDATA[Rating Clarification 3.5 Stars<br /><br />Where to even begin....this was called a fictional novel however it was based on Bethenny Frankel's life. Sure the names were changed and I'm sure there were some events added and taken out where necessary but I never felt like I was reading a novel. Why...]]>

  <description>In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol' dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she's sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. &lt;br /&gt;Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.</description>

  <description>Sadie White's summer job isn't going to be on the beach life-guarding or working at rental booths like most kids her age. With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.</description>

  <description>Getting a boy to fall head-over-heels in love with you isn’t easy. Especially when he’s been in love with your cousin for as long as you can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lana has lived her life in her cousin’s shadow. Ashton always made perfect grades, had tons of friends, and looks model-perfect. And she’s always had Sawyer Vincent—the only boy Lana’s ever wanted—wrapped around her finger. But now things are different. Lana has a chance to make Sawyer see her, and she’s taking it. If only he’d get over Ashton—because Lana is sick of second-best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sawyer’s heart is broken. He’s lost his best girl to his best friend. And then Lana comes to town. Ashton’s cousin has always been sweet and soft-spoken, but now she’s drop-dead gorgeous as well. Sawyer doesn’t know if Lana can heal his broken heart, but spending time with her might at least make Ashton jealous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts as a carefree fling becomes a lusty game of seduction. Sawyer and Lana may have different motives, but their scintillating hookups are the same kind of steamy. . . .</description>

  <description>Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, it’s his cousin Beau who catches Ashton’s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy she’s ever seen, and even though he’s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on Sawyer’s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. That’s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though he’s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in Sawyer’s absence, Beau knows he should say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashton and Beau don’t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. It’s getting way too hard to resist....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15817362-slammed" rel="nofollow"&gt; ASIN B008TRUDAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the unexpected death of her father, 18-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and younger brother. Outwardly, she appears resilient and tenacious, but inwardly, she's losing hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Will Cooper: The attractive, 21-year-old new neighbor with an intriguing passion for slam poetry and a unique sense of humor. Within days of their introduction, Will and Layken form an intense emotional connection, leaving Layken with a renewed sense of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long after an intense, heart-stopping first date, they are slammed to the core when a shocking revelation forces their new relationship to a sudden halt. Daily interactions become impossibly painful as they struggle to find a balance between the feelings that pull them together, and the secret that keeps them apart.</description>

Tough guy Riley has overcome the hard knocks of a working-class upbringing. Paige struggles to define her place as the heir to a famous antiques emporium. And Alyssa feels trapped by the restrictions of her family's old-world attitudes. Now this unlikely trio of strangers must come together to follow an elusive trail through the streets of San Francisco--from glittering Pacific Heights to colorful Chinatown to trendy south of Market. Each will have to make the impossible choice between romantic love and family loyalty, between sheltering lies and revealing truth. Once the door to the past is opened, there's no turning back....</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs—and wants—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</description>

  <description>Enigmatic and sexy, Professor Gabriel Emerson is a well respected Dante specialist by day, but by night he devotes himself to an uninhibited life of pleasure. He uses his notorious good looks and sophisticated charm to gratify his every whim, but is secretly tortured by his dark past and consumed by the profound belief that he is beyond all hope of redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the sweet and innocent Julia Mitchell enrolls as his graduate student, his attraction and mysterious connection to her not only jeopardizes his career, but sends him on a journey in which his past and his present collide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intriguing and sinful exploration of seduction, forbidden love and redemption, "Gabriel's Inferno" is a captivating and wildly passionate tale of one man's escape from his own personal hell as he tries to earn the impossible...forgiveness and love.</description>

  <description>Daunted by the singular sexual tastes and dark secrets of the beautiful, tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a Seattle publishing house. But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven, and demanding Fifty Shades. While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront her anger and envy of the women who came before her and make the most important decision of her life. Erotic, sparkling and suspenseful, Fifty Shades Darker is the irresistibly addictive second part of the Fifty Shades trilogy.</description>

  <description>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I’ve lost it. :( The only thing in the world I wasn’t supposed to lose. My engagement ring. It’s been in Magnus’s family for three generations. And now the very same day his parents are coming, I’ve lost it. The very same day! Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive :) !!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Poppy Wyatt has never felt luckier. She is about to marry her ideal man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her “happily ever after” begins to fall apart. Not only has she lost her engagement ring in a hotel fire drill but in the panic that follows, her phone is stolen. As she paces shakily around the lobby, she spots an abandoned phone in a trash can. Finders keepers! Now she can leave a number for the hotel to contact her when they find her ring. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, perfect except that the phone’s owner, businessman Sam Roxton, doesn’t agree. He wants his phone back and doesn’t appreciate Poppy reading his messages and wading into his personal life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What ensues is a hilarious and unpredictable turn of events as Poppy and Sam increasingly upend each other’s lives through emails and text messages. As Poppy juggles wedding preparations, mysterious phone calls, and hiding her left hand from Magnus and his parents . . . she soon realizes that she is in for the biggest surprise of her life.</description>

  <description>Mix 1 oz. Chelsea Handler, 1.5 oz. Nora Ephron, finish with a twist of Tina Fey, and you get Ali in Wonderland, the uproarious, revealing, and heartfelt memoir from acclaimed actress and comedian Ali Wentworth. Whether spilling secrets about her quintessentially WASPy upbringing (and her delicious rebellion against it), reminiscing about her &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;“Schmoopie” days and her appearances on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The View&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&lt;/em&gt;, or baring the details of starting a family alongside husband George Stephanopoulos, one thing is for sure—Ali has the unsurpassable humor and warmth of a born storyteller with a story to tell: the quirky, flavorful, surprising, and sometimes scandalous &lt;em&gt;Ali in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;.“Ali Wentworth is funny and warm and crazy all at once. Like Barbara Eden. But on something. Like crystal meth.” —Alec Baldwin</description>

  <description>Bestselling author Kristin Hannah explores the intimate landscape of a troubled marriage with this provocative and timely portrait of a husband and wife, in love and at war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a distance, Michael and Joleen Zarkades seem to have it all: a solid marriage, two exciting careers, and children they adore. But after twelve years together, the couple has lost their way; they are unhappy and edging toward divorce. Then the Iraq war starts. An unexpected deployment will tear their already fragile family apart, sending one of them deep into harm’s way and leaving the other at home, waiting for news. When the worst happens, each must face their darkest fear and fight for the future of their family. An intimate look at the inner landscape of a disintegrating marriage and a dramatic exploration of the price of war on a single American family, Home Front is a provocative and timely portrait of hope, honor, loss, forgiveness, and the elusive nature of love.</description>

  <description>Fans of Carla Neggars, Karen Robards, and Nora Roberts will enjoy this intricately suspenseful story that begins with the question -- what if you looked exactly like someone in a famous photograph?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything she's been told about her past is a lie ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie De Marco is planning a perfect San Francisco wedding when she comes face-to-face with a famous photograph, the startling inage of a little girl behind the iron gate of a foreign orphanage -- a girl who looks exactly like her. But Julia isn't an orphan. She isn't adopted. And she's never been out of the country. She knows who she is -- or does she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by uncertainty, Julia sets off on a dangerous search for her true identity -- her only clues a swan necklace and an old Russian doll, her only ally daring, sexy photographer Alex Manning. Suddenly nothing is as it seems. The people Julia loved and trusted become suspicious strangers. The relationships she believed in -- with her mother, her sister, and her fiance -- are shaken by new revelations. The only person she can trust is Alex, but he has secrets of his own. Each step brings her closer to a mysterious past that began a world away -- a past that still has the power to threaten her life ... and change her future forever.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Such a Pretty Fat&lt;/i&gt;, Jen Lancaster learned how to come to terms with her body. In &lt;i&gt;My Fair Lazy&lt;/i&gt;, she expanded her mind. Now the New York Times bestselling author gives herself—and her generation—a kick in the X, by facing her greatest challenge to date: acting her age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen is finally ready to put away childish things (except her Barbie Styling Head, of course) and embrace the investment-making, mortgage-carrying, life-insurance-having adult she’s become. From getting a mammogram to volunteering at a halfway house, she tackles the grown-up activities she’s resisted for years, and with each rite of passage she completes, she’ll uncover a valuable—and probably humiliating—life lesson that will ease her path to full-fledged, if reluctant, adulthood.</description>

  <description>"UNLESS someone like you...cares a whole awful lot...nothing is going to get better...It's not." Long before saving the earth became a global concern, Dr. Seuss, speaking through his character the Lorax, warned against mindless progress and the danger it posed to the earth's natural beauty. His classic cautionary tale is now available in an irresistible mini-edition, perfect for backpack or briefcase, for Arbor Day, Earth Day, and every day.</description>

  <description>Many adults name this book as their favorite Little Golden Book. Generations of kids have interacted with lovable, furry old Grover as he begs the reader not to turn the page—for fear of a monster at the end of the book. “Oh, I am so embarrassed,” he says on the last page . . . for, of course, the monster is Grover himself! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all-time favorite is now available as a Big Little Golden Book—perfect for lap-time reading.</description>

  <description>"One night, after thinking it over for some time, Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight." So begins this gentle story that shows just how far your imagination can take you. Armed only with an oversized purple crayon, young Harold draws himself a landscape full of beauty and excitement. But this is no hare-brained, impulsive flight of fantasy. Cherubic, round-headed Harold conducts his adventure with the utmost prudence, letting his imagination run free, but keeping his wits about him all the while. He takes the necessary purple-crayon precautions: drawing landmarks to ensure he won't get lost; sketching a boat when he finds himself in deep water; and creating a purple pie picnic when he feels the first pangs of hunger.</description>

  <description>If a big hungry moose comes to visit, you might give him a muffin to make him feel at home. If you give him a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it. When he's eaten all your muffins, he'll want to go to the store to get some more muffin mix. &lt;p&gt; In this hilarious sequel to &lt;i&gt; If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,&lt;/i&gt; the young host is again run ragged by a surprise guest. Young readers will delight in the comic complications that follow when a little boy entertains a gregarious moose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Children's Choices for 1992 (IRA/CBC)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Caney Paxton wanted his cafe to have the biggest and brightest sign in Eastern Oklahoma-the "opening soon" part was supposed to be just a removable, painted notice. But a fateful misunderstanding gave Vietnam vet Caney the flashiest joke in the entire state. Twelve years later, the once-busy highway is dead and the sign is as worn as Caney, who hasn't ventured outside the diner since it opened. Then one blustery December day, a thirtyish Crow woman blows in with a three-legged dog in her arms and a long-buried secret on her mind. Hiring on as a carhop, Vena Takes Horse is soon shaking up business, the locals, and Caney's heart...as she teaches them all about generosity of spirit, love, and the possibility of promise-just like the sign says.</description>

  <description>In this spectacular new novel, Barbara O’Neal delivers a generous helping of the best in life–family, food, and love–in the story of a woman’s search for the one thing worth more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-seven, Tessa Harlow is still working her way down her list of goals to “fall in love and have a family.” A self-described rolling stone, Tessa leads hiking tours for adventurous vacationers–it’s a job that’s taken her around the world but never a step closer to home. Then a freak injury during a trip already marred by tragedy forces her to begin her greatest adventure of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located high in the New Mexico mountains, Las Ladronas has become a magnet for the very wealthy and very hip, but once upon a time it was the setting of a childhood trauma Tessa can only half remember. Now, as she rediscovers both her old hometown and her past, Tessa is drawn to search-and-rescue worker Vince Grasso. The handsome widower isn’t her type. No more inclined to settle down than Tessa, Vince is the father of three, including an eight-year-old girl as lost as Tessa herself. But Tessa and Vince are both drawn to the town’s most beloved eatery–100 Breakfasts–and to each other. For Tessa, the restaurant is not only the key to the mystery that has haunted her life but a chance to find the home and the family she’s never known.</description>

  <description>A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. &lt;strong&gt;Charms for the Easy Life&lt;/strong&gt; is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The ties between women can run as deep as the ocean-but so can the secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 20 years, Kayla, Antoinette and Val have performed their own special summer ritual. Once a year, the old friends put aside their daily, separate lives to drink champagne, swap stories and swim naked under the Nantucket stars. But on one of those bonding nights, one of their trio swims out from the shore and doesn't return. After the surviving friends emerge from their grief, they realize that the repercussions of their loss go far beyond their little circle, and they begin to uncover layers of secrets--and their connections to each other--that were never revealed on the beach. What has made their friendship strong now has the power to destroy--their marriages, families, even themselves, in Elin Hilderbrand's &lt;i&gt;Nantucket Nights&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of Jonathan Tropper and Tom Perrotta comes Matthew Norman's &lt;em&gt;Domestic Violets&lt;/em&gt;—a darkly comic family drama about one man’s improbable trials of love, loss, and ambition; of attraction, impotence, and infidelity; and of mid-life malaise, poorly-planned revenge, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.</description>

      <![CDATA[What a fun book! I loved each of the characters. Although some characters didn't show up too often, when they did their stories were full enough to carry them. Mr. Norman has done a wonderful job in creating a real family dynamic that each of us can relate to in some way, shape, or form. ]]>

  <description>In her best-selling debut, &lt;i&gt;Commencement&lt;/i&gt;, J. Courtney Sullivan explored the complicated and contradictory landscape of female friendship. Now, in her highly anticipated second novel, Sullivan takes us into even richer territory, introducing four unforgettable women who have nothing in common but the fact that, like it or not, they’re family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Kellehers, Maine is a place where children run in packs, showers are taken outdoors, and old Irish songs are sung around a piano. Their beachfront property, won on a barroom bet after the war, sits on three acres of sand and pine nestled between stretches of rocky coast, with one tree bearing the initials “A.H.” At the cottage, built by Kelleher hands, cocktail hour follows morning mass, nosy grandchildren snoop in drawers, and decades-old grudges simmer beneath the surface. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As three generations of Kelleher women descend on the property one summer, each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant, waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep, never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the events of one night, long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns wickedly funny and achingly sad, &lt;i&gt;Maine&lt;/i&gt; unveils the sibling rivalry, alcoholism, social climbing, and Catholic guilt at the center of one family, along with the abiding, often irrational love that keeps them coming back, every summer, to Maine and to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes all you can do is fly away home . . . &lt;p&gt;When Sylvie Serfer met Richard Woodruff in law school, she had wild curls, wide hips, and lots of opinions. Decades later, Sylvie has remade herself as the ideal politician’s wife—her hair dyed and straightened, her hippie-chick wardrobe replaced by tailored knit suits. At fifty-seven, she ruefully acknowledges that her job is staying twenty pounds thinner than she was in her twenties and tending to her husband, the senator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzie, the Woodruffs’ younger daughter, is at twenty-four a recovering addict, whose mantra HALT (Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?) helps her keep her life under control. Still, trouble always seems to find her. Her older sister, Diana, an emergency room physician, has everything Lizzie failed to achieve—a husband, a young son, the perfect home—and yet she’s trapped in a loveless marriage. With temptation waiting in one of the ER’s exam rooms, she finds herself craving more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Richard’s extramarital affair makes headlines, the three women are drawn into the painful glare of the national spotlight. Once the press conference is over, each is forced to reconsider her life, who she is and who she is meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with an irresistible blend of heartbreak and hilarity, &lt;i&gt;Fly Away Home &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable story of a mother and two daughters who after a lifetime of distance finally learn to find refuge in one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you ..."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained-and captivated-by their stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would he say ...?</description>

  <description>Kelly Johnson becomes restless in her thirty-ninth year. An appetite for more forces her to take stock of her middling middle-American existence and her neighbors' seemingly perfect lives. Her marriage to a successful attorney has settled into a comfortable routine, and being the mother of two adorable sons has been rewarding. But Kelly's own passions lie wasted. She eyes with envy the lives of her two best friends, Kathryn and Charlotte, both beautiful, successful businesswomen who seem to have it all. Kelly takes charge of her life, devising a midlife makeover plan. From page one, Kelly's witty reflections, self-deprecating humor, and clever tactics in executing that plan--she places Post-it notes all over her house and car--will have readers laughing out loud. The next instant, however, they might rant right along with Kelly as her commitment to a sullen, anorexic teenager left on her doorstep tries her patience or as she deflects the boozy advances of a divorced neighbor. Readers will need to keep the tissue box handy, too, as Kelly repairs the damage she inflicted on a high school friend; realizes how deeply her husband, Patrick, understands and loves her; and ultimately grows into a woman empowered by her own blend of home and career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Endearingly honest, consistency upbeat" - Jenna Blum&lt;br /&gt;"A warm, witty and engaging debut that had me laughing out loud." - Amy Hatvany&lt;br /&gt;"This funny, moving novel is a model of inspiration and reinvention for anyone seeking to find what's next in life." - Katrina Kittle&lt;br /&gt;"I loved Kaira Rouda's book. I love its irony and its courage and humor. It's the real thing." Jacquelyn Mitchard</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A summertime story only Elin Hilderbrand can tell: a family in upheaval after a cancelled wedding fill an island summer with heartache, laughter, and surprises.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Birdie Cousins has thrown herself into the details of her daughter Chess's lavish wedding, from the floating dance floor in her Connecticut back yard to the color of the cocktail napkins. Like any mother of a bride-to-be, she is weathering the storms of excitement and chaos, tears and joy. But Birdie, a woman who prides herself on preparing for every possibility, could never have predicted the late-night phone call from Chess, abruptly announcing that she's cancelled her engagement. &lt;br /&gt; It's only the first hint of what will be a summer of upheavals and revelations. Before the dust has even begun to settle, far worse news arrives, sending Chess into a tailspin of despair. Reluctantly taking a break from the first new romance she's embarked on since the recent end of her 30-year marriage, Birdie circles the wagons and enlists the help of her younger daughter Tate and her own sister India. Soon all four are headed for beautiful, rustic Tuckernuck Island, off the coast of Nantucket, where their family has summered for generations. No phones, no television, no grocery store - a place without distractions where they can escape their troubles. &lt;br /&gt; But throw sisters, daughters, ex-lovers, and long-kept secrets onto a remote island, and what might sound like a peaceful getaway becomes much more. Before summer has ended, dramatic truths are uncovered, old loves are rekindled, and new loves make themselves known.</description>
