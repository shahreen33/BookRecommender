  <description>&lt;b&gt;Award-winning journalist Vivian Ho exposes a shattering true-crime story, shedding light on America’s new lost generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2015, the senseless Bay Area murders of twenty-three-year-old Audrey Carey and sixty-seven-year-old Steve Carter were personal tragedies for the victims’ families. But they also shed light on a more complex issue. The killers were three drifters scrounging for a living among a burgeoning counterculture population. Soon this community of runaways and transients became vulnerable scapegoats of a modern witch hunt. The supposedly progressive residents of San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, only two generations removed from the Summer of Love, now feared all of society’s outcasts as threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Those Who Wander&lt;/i&gt;, Vivian Ho delves deep into a rising subculture that’s changing the very fabric of her city and all of urban America. Moving beyond the disheartening statistics, she gives voices to these young people—victims of abuse, failed foster care, mental illness, and drug addiction. She also doesn’t ignore the threat they pose to themselves and to others as a dangerous dark side emerges. With alarming urgency, she asks what can be done to save the next generation of America’s vagabond youth.</description>

  <description>An extraordinarily beautiful Amish woman, a dangerous femme fatale, is the central figure in a story that reveals a dark side of Painters Mill and its seemingly perfect Amish world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A rainy night, an Amish father returning home with his three children, a speeding car hurtling toward them out of nowhere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;What at first seems like a tragic, but routine car accident suddenly takes on a more sinister cast as evidence emerges that nothing about the crash is accidental. But who would want to kill an Amish deacon and two of his children? He leaves behind a grieving widow and a young boy who clings to life in the intensive care wing of a hospital, unable to communicate. He may be the only one who knows what happened that night. Desperate to find out who killed her best friend's husband and why, Kate begins to suspect she is not looking for a reckless drunk, but instead is on the trail of a cold blooded killer amid the residents of Painter's Mill. It is a search that takes her on a chilling journey into the darkest reaches of the human heart and makes her question everything she has ever believed about the Amish culture into which she was born.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of SWORN TO SILENCE and GONE MISSING comes a powerful and moving story about a troubled young woman and a decades old mystery set in the world of the Amish.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s autumn in Painters Mill, and Chief of Police Kate Burkholder and John Tomasetti are taking a much-needed vacation at a small bed and breakfast an hour outside of town. After closing a difficult case, they’re looking forward to some down time, but their relaxation is cut short by rumors that the old house where they’re staying is haunted by a girl who disappeared twenty years earlier, leaving nothing behind but some bloody clothes by the river and rumors of a volatile relationship. Swept up in the girl’s story, and a need for justice, Kate and John begin looking into the mysterious disappearance of Angela Blaine.  They discover long-buried secrets—and unravel a mystery with an unexpected outcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - When a single mom becomes an empty nester, she spreads her wings to rediscover herself--and her passions--in this heartwarming novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jenna Boltz's life is at a crossroads. After a messy divorce from her surgeon husband nearly twenty years ago, she raised her two children on her own, juggling motherhood with her beloved job as a Seattle intensive-care nurse. Now that Paul and Allie have gone to college and moved out, Jenna can't help but wonder what her future holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her best friend, Maureen, is excited for Jenna's newfound independence. Now is the perfect time to finally book the trip to Paris they've been dreaming of since their college days. But when it comes to life's other great adventure--dating--Jenna still isn't sure she's ready to let love in . . . until an unexpected encounter begins to change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jenna's elderly mother breaks her hip, Dr. Rowan Lancaster saves the day. Despite his silent, stoic exterior, Rowan is immediately smitten with Jenna. And even though Jenna is hesitant about becoming involved with another surgeon, she has to admit that she's more than a little intrigued. But when Jenna's children approach her with shocking news, she realizes that she needs to have faith in love and embrace the unexpected--before the life she has always dreamed of passes her by.</description>

  <description>Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys sentenced to a hellish reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Civil Rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of Frenchtown in segregated Tallahassee, Elwood Curtis takes the words of Dr. Martin Luther King to heart: He is "as good as anyone." Abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South in the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called The Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides "physical, intellectual and moral training" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become "honorable and honest men."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, The Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors, where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear "out back." Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr. King's ringing assertion "Throw us in jail and we will still love you." His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked and the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at The Nickel Academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, &lt;i&gt;The Nickel Boys&lt;/i&gt; is a devastating, driven narrative.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Linda Castillo’s bestselling series continues with GONE MISSING—a deeply chilling novel about a rite of passage gone horribly wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumspringa is the time when Amish teens are allowed to experience life without the rules. It’s an exciting time of personal discovery and growth before committing to the church. But when a young teen disappears without a trace, the carefree fun comes to an abrupt and sinister end, and fear spreads through the community like a contagion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A missing child is a nightmare to all parents, and never more so than in the Amish community, where family ties run deep. When the search for the presumed runaway turns up a dead body, the case quickly becomes a murder investigation. And chief of Police Kate Burkholder knows that in order to solve this case she will have to call upon everything she has to give not only as a cop, but as a woman whose own Amish roots run deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate and state agent, John Tomasetti, delve into the lives of the missing teen and discover links to cold cases that may go back years. But will Kate piece together all the parts of this sinister puzzle in time to save the missing teen and the Amish community from a devastating fate? Or will she find herself locked in a fight to the death with a merciless killer?</description>

  <description>In a small town in Maine, recently widowed Eveleth "Evvie" Drake rarely leaves her house. Everyone in town, including her best friend, Andy, thinks grief keeps her locked inside, and she doesn't correct them. In New York, Dean Tenney, former major-league pitcher and Andy's childhood friend, is struggling with a case of the "yips": he can't throw straight anymore, and he can't figure out why. An invitation from Andy to stay in Maine for a few months seems like the perfect chance to hit the reset button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dean moves into an apartment at the back of Evvie's house, the two make a deal: Dean won't ask about Evvie's late husband, and Evvie won't ask about Dean's baseball career. Rules, though, have a funny way of being broken--and what starts as an unexpected friendship soon turns into something more. But before they can find out what might lie ahead, they'll have to wrestle a few demons: the bonds they've broken, the plans they've changed, and the secrets they've kept. They'll need a lot of help, but in life, as in baseball, there's always a chance--right up until the last out.</description>

  <description>Police Chief Kate Burkholder is called to the scene of a horrific tragedy on a peaceful Amish farm.&lt;p&gt;The Slabaugh family are model Amish farmers, prosperous and hardworking, with four children and a happy extended family. When the parents and an uncle are found dead in their barn, it appears to be a gruesome accident: methane gas asphyxiation caused by a poorly ventilated cesspit. But in the course of a routine autopsy, the coroner discovers that one of the victims suffered a head wound before death—clearly, foul play was involved. But who would want to make orphans of the Slabaughs’ children? And is this murder somehow related to a recent string of shocking hate crimes against the Amish? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having grown up Amish, Kate is determined to bring the killer to justice. Because the other series of attacks are designated hate crimes, the state sends in agent John Tomasetti, with whom Kate has a long and complex relationship. Together, they search for the link between the crimes—and uncover a dark secret at work beneath the placid surface of this idyllic Amish community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The first history of the United States told from the perspective of indigenous peoples.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today in the United States, there are more than five hundred federally recognized Indigenous nations comprising nearly three million people, descendants of the fifteen million Native people who once inhabited this land. The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spanning more than four hundred years, this classic bottom-up peoples’ history radically reframes US history and explodes the silences that have haunted our national narrative.</description>

  <description>The Plank family moved from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to join the small Amish community of Painters Mill less than a year ago and seemed the model of the Plain Life—until on a cold October night, the entire family of seven was found slaughtered on their farm. Police Chief Kate Burkholder and her small force have few clues, no motive, and no suspect. Formerly Amish herself, Kate is no stranger to the secrets the Amish keep from the English—and each other—but this crime is horribly out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;State agent John Tomasetti arrives on the scene to assist. He and Kate worked together on a previous case during which they began a volatile relationship. They soon realize the disturbing details of this case will test their emotional limits and force them to face demons from their own troubled pasts—and for Kate, a personal connection that is particularly hard to bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she discovers a diary that belonged to one of the teenaged daughters, Kate is shocked to learn the girl kept some very dark secrets and may have been living a lurid double life. Who is the charismatic stranger who stole the young Amish girl’s heart? Could the brother—a man with a violent past, rejected and shunned by his family and the Amish community, have come to seek out revenge? As Kate’s outrage grows so does her resolve to find the killer and bring him to justice—even if it means putting herself in the line of fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A candid memoir of denial, stolen identities, betrayal, faking it, and coming out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you know me?&lt;/i&gt;, the email began, sparking tremors of fear that turned into a full quake of panic when William Dameron discovered that his selfie had been stolen by strangers. On social networks and dating sites, his image and identity—a forty-year-old straight white male—had been used to hook countless women into believing in lies of love and romance. Was it all an ironic cosmic joke? Almost a decade prior, William himself had been living a lie that had lasted for more than twenty years. His secret? He was a gay man, a fact he hid from his wife and two daughters for almost as long as he had hidden it from himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this emotional and unflinchingly honest memoir of coming out of the closet late in life, owning up to the past, and facing the future, William Dameron confronts steroid addiction, the shame and homophobia of his childhood, the sledgehammer of secrets that slowly tore his marriage apart, and his love for a gay father of three that would once again challenge the boundaries of trust. At the true heart of &lt;i&gt;The Lie&lt;/i&gt; is a universal story about turning self-doubt into self-acceptance and about pain, anger, and the long journey of both seeking and giving forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It will take a Christmas miracle to melt her heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resort developer Madison Lane is about to lose the one thing she loves most in the world—her job. Dubbed "The Grinch Who Killed Christmas," Madison spoiled a deal that would turn quaint Christmas, Colorado, into a tourist's winter wonderland. Now the citizens want her fired but the company gives her one last chance, sending Madison to the small town to restore the holiday cheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sheriff Gage McBride, no hotshot executive from New York City is going to destroy the dreams of the people he loves. But one look at this beautiful woman and it's &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; heart that may be broken. In just a few days, Madison causes more trouble than he's had to deal with all year. He can't decide if she's naughty or nice, but one thing is for certain—Christmas will never be the same again...</description>

  <description>In the Deep South of the 1950s, journalist &lt;i&gt;John Howard Griffin&lt;/i&gt; decided to cross the color line. Using medication that darkened his skin to deep brown, he exchanged his privileged life as a Southern white man for the disenfranchised world of an unemployed black man. His audacious, still chillingly relevant eyewitness history is a work about race and humanity-that in this new millennium still has something important to say to every American.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not a fun book, but an important piece of non-fiction. The white author chose to truly walk in another man's shoes as he darkened his skin to live the life of a black man in 1960's America. It was a study of race relations as none other has experienced. ]]>

  &lt;i&gt;Listening time 9 hours 6 minutes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie's second husband is killed tragically when his 18-wheeler crashes into the rocks near their home in Cape San Blas--the tanker was full of fuel and the explosion could be seen on overhead satellites. She'd already lost the beloved waterfront restaurant her parents started and now losing her husband, no matter how unfulfilling their marriage was, might just push her over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph's time in Vietnam left him with scars that never seemed to heal. No matter how he's tried to love or what he's tried to do since then, he can't pull himself out of the wreckage of his former life. His trust and security shaken, he isolates himself in a cabin. But every morning, he faithfully pours two cups of coffee, drinking his while he sits with the second, and then pouring out the full cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's no small coincidence that Joseph found a mother and her two young children lost in the woods near his cabin. Or that when he helps them return to family in Florida, he's near enough to see that explosion. Near enough to know it's close to home. Near enough to know that his childhood sweetheart needs him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years have built so much distance between them, but it's the secrets that may be their final undoing. &lt;em&gt;Send Down the Rain &lt;/em&gt;reminds us of the beauty of truth . . . and the power of love to wash away the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now a major motion picture starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling novel that’s perfect for fans of John Green’s &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;, two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within a few feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>Reese’s southern heritage informs her whole life, and she loves sharing the joys of southern living with practically everyone she meets. She takes the South wherever she goes with bluegrass, big holiday parties, and plenty of Dorothea’s fried chicken. It’s reflected in how she entertains, decorates her home, and makes holidays special for her kids—not to mention how she talks, dances, and does her hair (in these pages, you will learn Reese’s fail-proof, only slightly insane hot-roller technique). Reese loves sharing her mother's most delicious recipes as well as her favorite southern traditions, from midnight barn parties to backyard bridal showers, magical Christmas mornings to rollicking honky-tonks.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut from &lt;i&gt;Forbes'&lt;/i&gt; third most powerful woman in the world, Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women's empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last twenty years, Melinda Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and inspiring book, Gates traces her awakening to the link between women's empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge" change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Gates took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Gates introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she's had with women from all over the world—and shows how we can all get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Gates' journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world's foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.</description>

In the beginning, she talks about the many ways in which powerful men and society hold women down. Its just not right! Men keep birth control from women but...]]>

  <description>From Jennifer Weiner, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Who Do You Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Her Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, comes a smart, thoughtful, and timely exploration of two sisters’ lives from the 1950s to the present as they struggle to find their places—and be true to themselves—in a rapidly evolving world. &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Everything&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we change or does the world change us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her most ambitious novel yet, Jennifer Weiner tells a story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world?</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci introduces a remarkable new character: Atlee Pine, an FBI special agent assigned to the remote wilds of the western United States. Ever since her twin sister was abducted by a notorious serial killer at age five, Atlee has spent her life hunting down those who hurt others. And she’s the best at it. She could be one of the Bureau’s top criminal profilers, if she didn’t prefer catching criminals in the vast wilderness of the West to climbing the career ladder in the D.C. office. Her chosen mission is a lonesome one–but that suits her just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Atlee is called in to investigate the mutilated carcass of a mule found in the Grand Canyon–and hopefully, solve the disappearance of its rider. But this isn’t the only recent disappearance. In fact, it may be just the first clue, the key to unraveling a rash of other similar missing persons cases in the canyon. . .</description>

      <![CDATA[A very likable and interesting new a strong female character from David Baldacci. The book moved along well and kept me interested. A little frightening in parts because there are some similarities to uncomfortable things happening in our own country. I will definitely continue with this series!]]>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>When a serial killer strikes bucolic Painters Mill, Ohio, the killer's signature -—Roman numerals ritualistically carved into each victim's abdomen- —matches the MO of four unsolved murders from 16 years earlier. Police chief Kate Burkholder, who's reluctant to dredge up the past, must keep secret that she knows why the old murders stopped. Not satisfied with the case's progress, local politicos set up a multijurisdictional task force to assist, including a law-enforcement agent battling his own demons. The added scrutiny and the rising body count threaten to push the chief over the edge. Adept at creating characters with depth and nuance, Castillo smoothly integrates their backstories into a well-paced plot that illuminates the divide between the Amish and English worlds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far would you go to find The One?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple DNA test is all it takes. Just a quick mouth swab and soon you’ll be matched with your perfect partner—the one you’re genetically made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the promise made by Match Your DNA. A decade ago, the company announced that they had found the gene that pairs each of us with our soul mate. Since then, millions of people around the world have been matched. But the discovery has its downsides: test results have led to the breakup of countless relationships and upended the traditional ideas of dating, romance and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now five very different people have received the notification that they’ve been “Matched.” They’re each about to meet their one true love. But “happily ever after” isn’t guaranteed for everyone. Because even soul mates have secrets. And some are more shocking than others…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word-of-mouth hit in the United Kingdom, The One is a fascinating novel that shows how even the simplest discoveries can have complicated consequences.</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>Slather on your sunscreen and slip on your shades! The NEW YORK TIMES bestselling Summer Boys series spins off into a hot new era--and an even hotter new summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In SUMMER BOYS, Beth, Ella, and Kelsi ruled Pebble Beach. Now it's time for 3 new girls to rock the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JESSICA: Liam is the cutest guy I've ever seen and he loves the beach as much as I do. So how do I show him I'd make a better girlfriend than friend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREER: I could be tanning on glam French beaches, but instead I'm "family-bonding" in Maine. At least the boys are hot - especially Brady. So what if he has a clingy ex-girlfriend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LARA: Just my luck. I've fallen hard for the one boy who's totally off limits. If only I could stop kissing him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Anne Rivers Siddons's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel about four friends whose lives are forever changed by the events of one summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fifteen years, four "girls of August" would gather together to spend a week at the beach, until tragedy interrupts their ritual. Now they reunite for a startling week of discoveries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ritual began when they were in their twenties and their husbands were in medical school, and became a mainstay of every summer thereafter. Their only criteria was oceanfront and isolation, their only desire to strengthen their far-flung friendships. They called themselves the Girls of August. But when one of the Girls dies tragically, the group slowly drifts apart and their vacations together are brought to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, a new marriage reunites them and they decide to come together once again on a remote barrier island off the South Carolina coast. There, far from civilization, the women uncover secrets that will change them in ways they never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

But at the end of this book I had tears running down my face and was cheering like at the end of Sleepless in Seattle.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by real-life serial killer Ted Bundy, an exhilarating thriller in which FBI profiler Caitlin Hendrix faces off against a charming, merciless serial killer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In southern Texas, on Saturday nights, women are disappearing. One vanishes from a movie theater. Another is ripped from her car at a stoplight. Another vanishes from her home while checking on her baby. Rookie FBI agent Caitlin Hendrix, newly assigned to the FBI's elite Behavioral Analysis Unit, fears that a serial killer is roaming the dark roads outside Austin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin and the FBI's serial crime unit discover the first victim's body in the woods. She's laid out in a bloodstained, white baby-doll nightgown. A second victim in a white nightie lies deeper in the forest's darkness. Both bodies are surrounded by Polaroid photos, stuck in the earth like headstones. Each photo pictures a woman in a white negligee, wrists slashed, suicide-style--posed like Snow White awaiting her prince's kiss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To track the UNSUB, Caitlin must get inside his mind. How is he selecting these women? Working with a legendary FBI profiler, Caitlin searches for a &lt;i&gt;homology&lt;/i&gt;--that elusive point where character and action come together. She profiles a confident, meticulous killer who convinces his victims to lower their guard until he can overpower and take them in plain sight. He then reduces them to objects in a twisted fantasy--dolls for him to possess, control, and ultimately destroy. Caitlin's profile leads the FBI to focus on one man: a charismatic, successful professional who easily gains people's trust. But with only circumstantial evidence linking him to the murders, the police allow him to escape. As Saturday night approaches, Caitlin and the FBI enter a desperate game of cat and mouse, racing to capture the cunning predator before he claims more victims.</description>

  <description>She was created for a purpose so revolutionary, someone was willing to kill for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Lexi Matthews keeps two secrets from her elite boarding school classmates—she’s the daughter of a famous and controversial geneticist, and she can influence people’s thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after new student Jack DeWeese heals her broken arm with an anything-but-simple touch, he forces Lexi to face a new reality—her abilities reach much further than speaking to the minds of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Lexi’s father goes missing and she receives threatening emails, she can’t decide whether to fall into Jack’s arms or run and hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lexi seeks answers to what she and Jack are, she discovers a truth more unsettling than anything her science books can teach. And letting Jack into her life of secrets is not only a threat to her very existence, but it just might break her heart wide open.</description>

  <description>A riveting psychological thriller inspired by the never-caught Zodiac Killer, about a young detective determined to apprehend the serial murderer who destroyed her family and terrorized a city twenty years earlier.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caitlin Hendrix has been a Narcotics detective for six months when the killer at the heart of all her childhood nightmares reemerges: the Prophet. An UNSUB—what the FBI calls an unknown subject—the Prophet terrorized the Bay Area in the 1990s and nearly destroyed her father, the lead investigator on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prophet’s cryptic messages and mind games drove Detective Mack Hendrix to the brink of madness, and Mack’s failure to solve the series of ritualized murders—eleven seemingly unconnected victims left with the ancient sign for Mercury etched into their flesh—was the final nail in the coffin for a once promising career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, two bodies are found bearing the haunting signature of the Prophet. Caitlin Hendrix has never escaped the shadow of her father’s failure to protect their city. But now the ruthless madman is killing again and has set his sights on her, threatening to undermine the fragile barrier she rigidly maintains for her own protection, between relentless pursuit and dangerous obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to decipher his twisted messages and stop the carnage, Caitlin ignores her father’s warnings as she draws closer to the killer with each new gruesome murder. Is it a copycat, or can this really be the same Prophet who haunted her childhood? Will Caitlin avoid repeating her father’s mistakes and redeem her family name, or will chasing the Prophet drag her and everyone she loves into the depths of the abyss?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a story first told in the popular &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; parenting blog comes a funny, touching memoir about a mother who welcomes more than a new daughter into her home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of waiting to adopt—slogging through paperwork and bouncing between hope and despair—a miracle finally happened for Vanessa McGrady. Her sweet baby, Grace, was a dream come true. Then Vanessa made a highly uncommon gesture: when Grace’s biological parents became homeless, Vanessa invited them to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a blueprint for navigating the practical basics of an open adoption or any discussion of expectations or boundaries, the unusual living arrangement became a bottomless well of conflicting emotions and increasingly difficult decisions complicated by missed opportunities, regret, social chaos, and broken hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with wit, candor, and compassion, &lt;i&gt;Rock Needs River&lt;/i&gt; is, ultimately, Vanessa’s love letter to her daughter, one that illuminates the universal need for connection and the heroine’s journey to find her tribe.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The West Wing&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; in this fresh and funny exclusive look into President Barack Obama’s years in the White House, directly from his Senior Writer and former Director of Messaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;West Winging It: An Unpresidential Memoir&lt;/i&gt; is the personal story of Pat Cunnane and his journey from outsider to insider, from his dreary job at a warehouse to his dream job at the White House. Pat pulls the drapes back on the most famous and exclusive building in the United States, telling the story of the real West Wing with compelling and quirky portraits of the people who populate the place, from the President to the press corps. Pat takes you into the Oval Office, providing a witty insider’s glimpse of that it’s really like—from the minutiae to the momentous—to work at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Along the way, Pat draws an intimate portrait of the side of President Obama that few were privy to—the funnyman, the nerd, the athlete, the caring parent. He describes both the small details—the time he watched in horror as the President reached over the sneeze guard at Chipotle—and the larger, historic moments, such as watching the President handle the news of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. In some ways, working at the White House is a lot like every office, and in some ways, it’s like no office ever. Pat recounts the time he accidentally slammed a door on Joe Biden, plotted to have the Pope bless him by faking a sneeze, and almost killed America’s First Dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pat’s story is one of proximity to history, revealing an office where both the historically momentous and the hilariously mundane occurred every day. He brings the White House to life with hysterical, heartwarming, and sharply observed depictions of the President and Vice President. It’s a fun portrait of a remarkable time and an extraordinary President, featuring a bunch of brilliant, quirky staffers bursting in and out of frame. He recounts the behind-the-scene highs and lows of the West Wing, from the elation of 2012 to the despair of 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Filled with sharp observations and exclusive photos, &lt;i&gt;West Winging It&lt;/i&gt; is at its core a fish-out-of-water story—only these fish are trying to run the United States of America.</description>

  <description>Once described by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; as “the most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of,” Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-seven-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has now emerged as one of the nation’s most visionary politicians. With soaring prose that celebrates a resurgent American Midwest, &lt;em&gt;Shortest Way Home&lt;/em&gt; narrates the heroic transformation of a “dying city” (&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;) into nothing less than a shining model of urban reinvention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving two narratives—that of a young man coming of age and a town regaining its economic vitality—Buttigieg recounts growing up in a Rust Belt city, amid decayed factory buildings and the steady soundtrack of rumbling freight trains passing through on their long journey to Chicagoland. Inspired by John F. Kennedy’s legacy, Buttigieg first left northern Indiana for red-bricked Harvard and then studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, before joining McKinsey, where he trained as a consultant—becoming, of all things, an expert in grocery pricing. Then, Buttigieg defied the expectations that came with his pedigree, choosing to return home to Indiana and responding to the ultimate challenge of how to revive a once-great industrial city and help steer its future in the twenty-first century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elected at twenty-nine as the nation’s youngest mayor, Pete Buttigieg immediately recognized that “great cities, and even great nations, are built through attention to the everyday.” As &lt;em&gt;Shortest Way Home&lt;/em&gt; recalls, the challenges were daunting—whether confronting gun violence, renaming a street in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., or attracting tech companies to a city that had appealed more to junk bond scavengers than serious investors. None of this is underscored more than Buttigieg’s audacious campaign to reclaim 1,000 houses, many of them abandoned, in 1,000 days and then, even as a sitting mayor, deploying to serve in Afghanistan as a Navy officer. Yet the most personal challenge still awaited Buttigieg, who came out in a South Bend Tribune editorial, just before being reelected with 78 percent of the vote, and then finding Chasten Glezman, a middle-school teacher, who would become his partner for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Washington reels with scandal, &lt;em&gt;Shortest Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, with its graceful, often humorous, language, challenges our perception of the typical American politician. In chronicling two once-unthinkable stories—that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a revitalized Rust Belt city no longer regarded as “flyover country”—Buttigieg provides a new vision for America’s shortest way home.</description>

  <description>Gloria Steinem—writer, activist, organizer, and one of the most inspiring leaders in the world—now tells a story she has never told before, a candid account of how her early years led her to live an on-the-road kind of life, traveling, listening to people, learning, and creating change. She reveals the story of her own growth in tandem with the growth of an ongoing movement for equality. This is the story at the heart of &lt;i&gt;My Life on the Road&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A vivid biography of former First Lady Barbara Bush, one of the most influential and under-appreciated women in American political history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Pierce Bush was one of the country’s most popular and powerful figures, yet her full story has never been told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MATRIARCH tells the riveting tale of a woman who helped define two American presidencies and an entire political era. Written by USA TODAY’s Washington Bureau chief Susan Page, this biography is informed by more than one hundred interviews with Bush friends and family members, hours of conversation with Mrs. Bush herself in the final six months of her life, and access to her diaries that spanned decades. THE MATRIARCH examines not only her public persona but also less well-known aspects of her remarkable life. As a girl in Rye, New York, Barbara Bush weathered criticism of her weight from her mother, barbs that left lifelong scars. As a young wife, she coped with the death of her three-year-old daughter from leukemia, a loss that changed her forever. In middle age, she grappled with depression so serious that she contemplated suicide. And as first the wife and then the mother of American presidents, she made history as the only woman to see — and advise — both her husband and son in the Oval Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many women of her era, Barbara Bush was routinely underestimated, her contributions often neither recognized nor acknowledged. But she became an astute and trusted political campaign strategist and a beloved First Lady. She invested herself deeply in expanding literacy programs in America, played a critical role in the end of the Cold War, and led the way in demonstrating love and compassion to those with HIV/AIDS. With her cooperation, this book offers Barbara Bush’s last words for history — on the evolution of her party, on the role of women, on Donald Trump, and on her family’s legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Bush’s accomplishments, struggles, and contributions are many. Now, Susan Page explores them all in THE MATRIARCH, a groundbreaking book certain to cement Barbara Bush as one of the most unique and influential women in American history.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;The #1 bestselling female detective of the past 50 years is back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Detective Lindsay Boxer and her husband Joe Molinari team up to protect San Francisco from an international war criminal in the newest Women's Murder Club thriller.&lt;p&gt;Three female schoolteachers go missing in San Francisco, and Detective Lindsay Boxer is on the case-which quickly escalates from missing person to murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under pressure at work, Lindsay needs support at home. But her husband Joe is drawn into an encounter with a woman who's seen a ghost--a notorious war criminal from her Eastern European home country, walking the streets of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lindsay digs deeper, with help from intrepid journalist Cindy Thomas, there are revelations about the victims. The implications are shocking. And when Joe's mystery informant disappears, joining the ranks of missing women in grave danger, all evidence points to a sordid international crime operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take the combined skills of Lindsay, Joe, and the entire Women's Murder Club to protect their city, and themselves, from a monster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Detective Amos Decker discovers that a mistake he made as a rookie detective may have led to deadly consequences in the latest Memory Man thriller in David Baldacci's #1 New York Times bestselling series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker and his FBI partner Alex Jamison are visiting his hometown of Burlington, Ohio, when he's approached by an unfamiliar man. But he instantly recognizes the man's name: Meryl Hawkins. He's the first person Decker ever arrested for murder back when he was a young detective. Though a dozen years in prison have left Hawkins unrecognizably aged and terminally ill, one thing hasn't changed: He maintains he never committed the murders. Could it be possible that Decker made a mistake all those years ago? As he starts digging into the old case, Decker finds a startling connection to a new crime that he may be able to prevent, if only he can put the pieces together quickly enough...</description>

  <description>Can a romcom-obssessed romantic finally experience the meet-cute she always dreamed of or will reality never compare to fiction, in this charming debut adult novel from Kerry Winfrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Cassidy dreams of being the next Nora Ephron. She spends her days writing screenplays, rewatching Sleepless in Seattle, and waiting for her movie-perfect meet-cute. If she could just find her own Tom Hanks—a man who’s sweet, sensitive, and possibly owns a houseboat—her problems would disappear and her life would be perfect. But Tom Hanks is nowhere in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a movie starts filming in her neighborhood and Annie gets a job on set, it seems like a sign. Then Annie meets the lead actor, Drew Danforth, a cocky prankster who couldn’t be less like Tom Hanks if he tried. Their meet-cute is more of a meet-fail, but soon Annie finds herself sharing some classic rom-com moments with Drew. Her Tom Hanks can’t be an actor who’s leaving town in a matter of days...can he?</description>

  <description>The first Latinx (Puerto Rican) and third woman appointed to the US Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor has become an instant American icon. Now, with a candor and intimacy never undertaken by a sitting Justice, she recounts her life from a Bronx housing project to the federal bench, a journey that offers an inspiring testament to her own extraordinary determination and the power of believing in oneself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the story of a precarious childhood, with an alcoholic father (who would die when she was 9) and a devoted but overburdened mother, and of the refuge a little girl took from the turmoil at home with her passionately spirited paternal grandmother. But it was when she was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes that the precocious Sonia recognized she must ultimately depend on herself. She would learn to give herself the insulin shots she needed to survive and soon imagined a path to a different life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only television characters for her professional role models, and little understanding of what was involved, she determined to become a lawyer, a dream that would sustain her on an unlikely course, from valedictorian of her high school class to the highest honors at Princeton, Yale Law School, the New York County District Attorney’s office, private practice, and appointment to the Federal District Court before the age of 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She speaks with warmth and candor about her invaluable mentors, a failed marriage, and the modern version of extended family she has created from cherished friends and their children. Through her still-astonished eyes, America’s infinite possibilities are envisioned anew in this warm and honest book, destined to become a classic of self-invention and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>Nestled in the Hudson Valley is a sumptuous retreat boasting every amenity: organic meals, private fitness trainers, daily massages—and all of it for free. In fact, you get paid big money—more than you've ever dreamed of—to spend a few seasons in this luxurious locale. The catch? For nine months, you belong to the Farm. You cannot leave the grounds; your every move is monitored. Your former life will seem a world away as you dedicate yourself to the all-consuming task of producing the perfect baby for your überwealthy clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane, an immigrant from the Philippines and a struggling single mother, is thrilled to make it through the highly competitive Host selection process at the Farm. But now pregnant, fragile, consumed with worry for her own young daughter's well-being, Jane grows desperate to reconnect with her life outside. Yet she cannot leave the Farm or she will lose the life-changing fee she'll receive on delivery—or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartbreaking, suspenseful, provocative, &lt;i&gt;The Farm&lt;/i&gt; pushes our thinking on motherhood, money, and merit to the extremes, and raises crucial questions about the trade-offs women will make to fortify their futures and the futures of those they love.</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;In 1959 Florence Green, a kindhearted widow with a small inheritance, risks everything to open a bookshop - the only bookshop - in the seaside town of Hardborough. By making a success of a business so impractical, she invites the hostility of the town's less prosperous shopkeepers. By daring to enlarge her neighbors' lives, she crosses Mrs. Gamart, the local arts doyenne. Florence's warehouse leaks, her cellar seeps, and the shop is apparently haunted. Only too late does she begin to suspect the truth: a town that lacks a bookshop isn't always a town that wants one.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a &lt;i&gt;Tätowierer&lt;/i&gt; (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, &lt;i&gt;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt; is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times-bestselling author comes a pulse-pounding domestic thriller about a group of friends who have been bound for twenty years by a single secret—and will now be undone by it. &lt;i&gt;Someone Knows&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional exploration of friendship and family, as well as a psychological exploration of guilt and memory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, in an upscale suburb of Philadelphia, four teenagers spent a summer as closest friends: drinking, sharing secrets, testing boundaries. When a new boy looked to join them, they decided to pull a prank on him, convincing him to play Russian roulette as an initiation into their group. They secretly planned to leave the gun unloaded—but what happened next would change each of them forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now three of the four reunite for the first time since that horrible summer. The guilt—and the lingering question about who loaded the gun—drove them apart. But after one of the group apparently commits suicide with a gun, their old secrets come roaring back. One of them is going to figure out if the new suicide is what it seems, and if it connects to the events of that long-ago summer. Someone knows exactly what happened—but who? And how far will they go to keep their secrets buried?</description>

  <description>In the months since Donald Trump's shocking presidential upset, a movement has been coalescing in America-and when millions of women descended upon Washington, DC in January 2017 (and six hundred sister marches all across the country and the world), it was a wake-up call and the largest single-day demonstration in the history of the United States. But the truth is, women's rights didn't start or end there. There's a lot more to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Keep Marching&lt;/i&gt;, CEO of MomsRising.org and one of the contributing authors of the Unity Principles Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner examines societal, institutional, and political barriers that women historically and currently face and what you can do to dismantle them. Filled with inspiring stories from women on the front lines, along with revealing facts and insights on key issues to arm you with the intel you need to debate anyone from a male chauvinist boss to a policymaker, &lt;i&gt;Keep Marching&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking, definitive work that will help move our country forward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With each chapter focusing on different issues, from gender and racial discriminating laws, mass incarceration, family economic security, glass ceilings, violence against women, reproductive rights and more; Rowe-Finkbeiner offers practical tips and to-do lists on organizing and effecting change in our own communities, advances policy solutions that will lift everyone, and shares high impact strategies that anyone can use to keep marching online and on the ground (and why it matters so much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book is a roadmap for a continued movement toward equality. More and more people realize that democracy isn't about one election, one Oval Office, one march, or one day-but it is instead about making democracy a regular practice in our everyday lives. &lt;i&gt;Keep Marching&lt;/i&gt; calls for a continued path to change-and it will be lifted by the platform of action and engagement of MomsRising.org, which has an audience of over a million women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;100% of the proceeds of the book will be donated to MomsRising.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The official, definitive book from The March for Our Lives founders about the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, the March for Our Lives, and the ongoing fight for sensible gun control legislation in the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLIMMER OF HOPE: HOW TRAGEDY SPARKED A MOVEMENT chronicles in first person essays the events of February 14th and the creation of the March for our Lives from the founders of the movement, including Emma González, Cameron Kasky, Jaclyn Corin, and more. The book also features oral histories of both the first day back to school following the shooting and the March for Our Lives, one of the largest marches in America’s history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 14th, 2018, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida was the site of one of the worst mass shootings in American history, in which 17 students and teachers were killed and 17 more were injured. Instead of dwelling on the pain and tragedy of that fateful day, a group of inspiring students from MSD channeled their feelings of hurt, rage, and sorrow into action, and went on to create one of the largest youth-led movements in global history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>London, 1853: Innkeeper’s daughter Mina Scott will do anything to escape the drudgery of her life, for there’s nothing more mundane than serving customers day after day. Every minute she can, she reads and dreams of someday becoming a real lady—and catch the eye of William Barlow, a frequent guest at the inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William is a gentleman’s son, a charming but penniless rogue. However, his bachelor uncle will soon name an heir—either him or his scheming cousin. In an effort to secure the inheritance, William gives his uncle the impression he’s married, which works until he’s invited to bring his wife for a visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William asks Mina to be his pretend bride, only until his uncle names an heir on Christmas Day. Mina is flattered and frustrated by the offer, for she wants a true relationship with William. Yet, she agrees. . .then wishes she hadn’t. So does William. Deceiving the old man breaks both their hearts. When the truth is finally discovered, more than just money is lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can two hearts survive such deception?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African-American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed &lt;i&gt;Carpool Karaoke&lt;/i&gt;, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm, wise, and revelatory, &lt;i&gt;Becoming&lt;/i&gt; is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>#MeToo: Essays About How and Why This Happened, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What It Means and How To Make Sure It Never Happens Again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 16 million people had posted their #MeToo story and support against sexual harassment by mid-October as a reaction to Rose McGowan’s brave admission that she had allegedly been raped by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. A groundswell of reaction to and exposure of this sexual predation was unleashed that has spread throughout Europe and beyond. New revelations of unacceptable behavior in every industry break every day as people come forward in response to the viral #MeToo posts. Protests are scheduled such as the "Take back the Workplace” Hollywood march in November of 2017, and legislation is being drafted in New York and California to finally change the way things have been for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the turning point. Things are going to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a historic moment and it needs to be memorialized, passed around and passed on. Although social media is a fantastic means of igniting a fire, it needs to keep burning, like a torch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Riverdale Avenue Books, a woman-owned leading hybrid publisher, is putting its money, words and power, behind this and publishing this collection of 26 essays from people who understand want to make this change, and we, as a society, have got to figure out a way to drive that change forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pass this book around. Share it with your sons, brothers, fathers, your daughters, sisters and mothers, your co-workers and friends. Read passages to them, if they won’t read it for themselves. Leave it on the desk of someone who should know better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help us make this movement more than a hashtag.</description>

  <description>The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center—a women’s reproductive health services clinic—its staff offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester disguised as a patient, who now stands in the cross hairs of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed individual himself, vowing to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the same place on this fateful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Picoult—one of the most fearless writers of our time—tackles a complicated issue in this gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to be a good parent? &lt;i&gt;A Spark of Light&lt;/i&gt; will inspire debate, conversation . . . and, hopefully, understanding.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love Jodi Picoult. Her books usually have me totally engaged but this one did not. I was very interested in the subject matter but the timeline was confusing and the characters didn't connect with me. So, I just gave it a 3. But, I eagerly await the next book. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The true story of an all-American girl and a boy from an impoverished &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;city in Zimbabwe and the letter that changed both of their lives forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started as an assignment. Everyone in Caitlin's class wrote to an unknown student somewhere in a distant place. All the other kids picked countries like France or Germany, but when Caitlin saw &lt;i&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/i&gt; written on the board, it sounded like the most exotic place she had ever heard of--so she chose it. &lt;br /&gt;Martin was lucky to even receive a pen pal letter. There were only ten letters, and forty kids in his class. But he was the top student, so he got the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That letter was the beginning of a correspondence that spanned six years and changed two lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling dual memoir, Caitlin and Martin recount how they became best friends --and better people--through letters. Their story will inspire readers to look beyond their own lives and wonder about the world at large and their place in it.</description>

  <description>When &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; declared on the cover of a June 2014 issue that the Houston Astros would win the World Series in 2017, people thought Ben Reiter, the article's author, was crazy. The Astros were the worst baseball team in half a century, but they were more than just bad. They were an embarrassment, a club that didn't even appear to be trying to win. The cover story, combined with the specificity of Reiter's claim, met instant and nearly universal derision. But three years later, the critics were proved improbably, astonishingly wrong. How had Reiter predicted it so accurately? And, more important, how had the Astros pulled off the impossible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astroball&lt;/i&gt; is the inside story of how a gang of outsiders went beyond the stats to find a new way to win--and not just in baseball. When new Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and his top analyst, the former rocket scientist Sig Mejdal, arrived in Houston in 2011, they had already spent more than half a decade trying to understand how human instinct and expertise could be blended with hard numbers such as on-base percentage and strikeout rate to guide their decision-making. In Houston, they had free rein to remake the club. No longer would scouts, with all their subjective, hard-to-quantify opinions, be forced into opposition with the stats guys. Instead, Luhnow and Sig wanted to correct for the biases inherent in human observation, and then roll their scouts' critical thoughts into their process. The numbers had value--but so did the gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strategy paid off brilliantly, and surprisingly quickly. It pointed the Astros toward key draft picks like Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman; offered a path for developing George Springer, Jos� Altuve, and Dallas Keuchel; and showed them how veterans like Carlos Beltr�n and Justin Verlander represented the last piece in the puzzle of fielding a championship team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting at the nexus of sports, business, and innovation--and written with years of access to the team's stars and executives--&lt;i&gt;Astroball&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the next wave of thinking in baseball and beyond, at once a remarkable underdog story and a fascinating look at the cutting edge of evaluating and optimizing human potential.</description>

      <![CDATA[If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. Granted you do need to be a baseball fan to enjoy it. But you don't have to be an Astros fan. It was great to read the stories of how some of our stars developed. I love all the statistics of baseball and how every little pitch or play is planned out. B...]]>

  <description>Perfect for fans of the hit Broadway musical &lt;em&gt;Come from Away&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;When 38 jetliners bound for the United States were forced to land at Gander International Airport in Canada by the closing of U.S. airspace on September 11, the population of this small town on Newfoundland Island swelled from 10,300 to nearly 17,000. The citizens of Gander met the stranded passengers with an overwhelming display of friendship and goodwill. As the passengers stepped from the airplanes, exhausted, hungry and distraught after being held on board for nearly 24 hours while security checked all of the baggage, they were greeted with a feast prepared by the townspeople. Local bus drivers who had been on strike came off the picket lines to transport the passengers to the various shelters set up in local schools and churches. Linens and toiletries were bought and donated. A middle school provided showers, as well as access to computers, email, and televisions, allowing the passengers to stay in touch with family and follow the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of those four days, many of the passengers developed friendships with Gander residents that they expect to last a lifetime. As a show of thanks, scholarship funds for the children of Gander have been formed and donations have been made to provide new computers for the schools. This book recounts the inspiring story of the residents of Gander, Canada, whose acts of kindness have touched the lives of thousands of people and been an example of humanity and goodwill.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

There’s no year in the writing and I think that’s because it needs to serve as a reminder that it could happen at any time that we allow our rights to be taken away.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Sir, the First Lady ... has gone rogue."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Tucker is caught up in a media firestorm. The scandal of his affair has sent shockwaves through his re-election campaign, and threatens to derail everything he has worked for. To win the vote, he needs the First Lady to stand by his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But Grace Tucker has a mind of her own.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of compromise, unfulfilled promises, deception and betrayal, Grace refuses to give in to her husband's demands. Escaping the city and her Secret Service agents, she is officially off the radar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But did the First Lady run away? Or is she in far greater danger than anyone could have imagined?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

If you're ready to make some serious changes around here, &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt; will help you: Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviors that stop you from getting what you want, blast past your fears so you can take big exciting risks, figure out how to make some damn money already, learn to love yourself and others, set big goals and reach them - it will basically show you how to create a life you totally love, and how to create it &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt;, you'll understand why you are how you are, how to love what you can't change, how to change what you don't love, and how to use The Force to kick some serious ass.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Remember when presidents spoke in complete sentences instead of in unhinged tweets? David Litt does. In his comic, coming-of-age memoir, he takes us back to the Obama years – and charts a path forward in the age of Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than any other presidency, Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House were defined by young people – twenty-somethings who didn’t have much experience in politics (or anything else, for that matter), yet suddenly found themselves in the most high-stakes office building on earth. David Litt was one of those twenty-somethings. After graduating from college in 2008, he went straight to the Obama campaign. In 2011, he became one of the youngest White House speechwriters in history. Until leaving the White House in 2016, he wrote on topics from healthcare to climate change to criminal justice reform. As President Obama’s go-to comedy writer, he also took the lead on the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the so-called “State of the Union of jokes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in this refreshingly honest memoir, Litt brings us inside Obamaworld. With a humorists’ eye for detail, he describes what it’s like to accidentally trigger an international incident or nearly set a president’s hair aflame. He answers questions you never knew you had: Which White House men’s room is the classiest? What do you do when the commander in chief gets your name wrong? Where should you never, under any circumstances, change clothes on Air Force One? With nearly a decade of stories to tell, Litt makes clear that politics is completely, hopelessly absurd.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s also important. For all the moments of chaos, frustration, and yes, disillusionment, Litt remains a believer in the words that first drew him to the Obama campaign: “People who love this country can change it.” In telling his own story, Litt sheds fresh light on his former boss’s legacy. And he argues that, despite the current political climate, the politics championed by Barack Obama will outlive the presidency of Donald Trump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of hilarious stories and told in a truly original voice, &lt;em&gt;Thanks, Obama&lt;/em&gt; is an exciting debut about what it means – personally, professionally, and politically – to grow up.</description>

  <description>Anthony Ray Hinton was poor and black when he was convicted of two murders he hadn't committed. For the next three decades he was trapped in solitary confinement in a tiny cell on death row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually his case was taken up by the award-winning lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, who managed to have him exonerated, though it took 15 years for this to happen. How did Hinton cope with the mental and emotional torture of his situation, and emerge full of compassion and forgiveness? This is a story of hope and the resilience of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>Leah Burke—girl-band drummer, master of deadpan, and Simon Spier’s best friend from the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda&lt;/i&gt;—takes center stage in this novel of first love and senior-year angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat—but real life isn’t always so rhythmic. An anomaly in her friend group, she’s the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she’s bisexual, she hasn’t mustered the courage to tell her friends—not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Leah really doesn’t know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. It’s hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting—especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.</description>

  <description>A poetic and powerful memoir about what it means to be a Black woman in America—and the co-founding of a movement that demands justice for all in the land of the free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised by a single mother in an impoverished neighborhood in Los Angeles, Patrisse Khan-Cullors experienced firsthand the prejudice and persecution Black Americans endure at the hands of law enforcement. For Patrisse, the most vulnerable people in the country are Black people. Deliberately and ruthlessly targeted by a criminal justice system serving a white privilege agenda, Black people are subjected to unjustifiable racial profiling and police brutality. In 2013, when Trayvon Martin’s killer went free, Patrisse’s outrage led her to co-found Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condemned as terrorists and as a threat to America, these loving women founded a hashtag that birthed the movement to demand accountability from the authorities who continually turn a blind eye to the injustices inflicted upon people of Black and Brown skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Championing human rights in the face of violent racism, Patrisse is a survivor. She transformed her personal pain into political power, giving voice to a people suffering in equality and a movement fueled by her strength and love to tell the country—and the world—that Black Lives Matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When They Call You a Terrorist&lt;/i&gt; is Patrisse Khan-Cullors and asha bandele’s reflection on humanity. It is an empowering account of survival, strength and resilience and a call to action to change the culture that declares innocent Black life expendable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The runaway bestseller &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt; introduced the real-life heroine Caroline Ferriday. This sweeping new novel, set a generation earlier and also inspired by true events, features Caroline's mother, Eliza, and follows three equally indomitable women from St. Petersburg to Paris under the shadow of World War I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1914 and the world has been on the brink of war so many times, many New Yorkers treat the subject with only passing interest. Eliza Ferriday is thrilled to be traveling to St. Petersburg with Sofya Streshnayva, a cousin of the Romanov's. The two met years ago one summer in Paris and became close confidantes. Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia's Imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their country estate. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortuneteller's daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their household. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya's letters suddenly stop coming she fears the worst for her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg to the avenues of Paris and the society of fallen Russian emigre's who live there, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways, taking readers on a breathtaking ride through a momentous time in history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A CBS TV SERIES STARRING ALAN CUMMING -- PREMIERING MARCH 2018&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
      &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Murder Games&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Dr. Dylan Reinhart wrote the book on criminal behavior. Literally--he's a renowned, bestselling Ivy League expert on the subject. When a copy of his book turns up at a gruesome murder scene--along with a threatening message from the killer--it looks like someone has been taking notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Needham is the headstrong and brilliant NYPD Detective in charge of the case who recruits Dylan to help investigate another souvenir left at the scene--a playing card. Another murder, another card--and now Dylan suspects that the cards aren't a signature, they're a deadly hint--pointing directly toward the next victim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tabloid headlines about the killer known as "The Dealer" scream from newstands, New York City descends into panic. With the cops at a loss, it's up to Dylan to hunt down a serial killer unlike any the city has ever seen. Only someone with Dylan's expertise can hope to go inside the mind of a criminal and convince The Dealer to lay down his cards.

  <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that: &lt;br /&gt;(1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces &lt;br /&gt;(2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations &lt;br /&gt;(3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt; really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five-year-old Blake Powell’s world is baseball. His life goal is a major league contract and he is laser focused on honing his game and his body as close to perfection as he can get. Then a moment of distraction, a wrong step, and a bone-shattering injury put an early end to his baseball career. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ian Chapman is happy with his life. He has his own house, a decent job, good friends, and he’s the de facto manager of a team in the city’s gay softball league. Unfortunately, he’s missing a key player to help his team rise from the basement and the man at his side to make his personal game complete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Blake moves in next door, Ian sees in him a solution to the team’s woes, and soon it becomes obvious something more personal might grow, too. Then Blake’s first love, the game of baseball, comes calling again, and he is compelled to answer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Complete Game is a 55,000 word first time gay romance with no cliffhangers and a happily ever after ending. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A stunning legal thriller, &lt;em&gt; Rough Justice &lt;/em&gt; confirms that Edgar Award winner Lisa Scottoline shows readers more than a good crime. With her fifth novel, Scottoline breaks new ground in fiction's hottest genre and launches a riveting series featuring the adventures of an all-woman law firm. No one but a Scottoline could write this series. As &lt;em&gt; Rough Justice &lt;/em&gt; opens, criminal lawyer Marta Richter is only hours away from winning an acquittal on a murder charge leveled against her client, millionaire businessman Elliot Steere. But as the jury begins to deliberate, Steere lets it slip that he sold Marta a bogus self-defense claim and that he in fact murdered the homeless man who tried to carjack him. Infuriated, Marta sets out to find evidence that will convict Steere -- before the jury returns with its verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marta has her hands full; she's playing beat-the-clock with both the jury and the worst blizzard Philadelphians have seen in decades. She drafts help in the form of two able young lawyers -- Mary DiNunzio and Judy Carrier -- from the all-female firm Rosato &amp;amp; Associates. DiNunzio and Carrier wade through snowdrifts and computer records, interview witnesses and scour the crime scene for evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Bennie Rosato, managing partner of Rosato &amp;amp; Associates. When she realizes that Marta is determined to convict her own client -- and ruin the law firm in the process -- Bennie acts to thwart Marta's plans and bring Steere to justice in her own way. But Elliot Steere didn't reach the top of the real estate business without bloody knuckles. He won't let anyone -- especially a couple of lawyers -- stand between him and freedom. Even from his jail cell, the businessman has the cunning and connections to kill again. The lawyers have finally met their match in Elliot Steere. Or have they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Rough Justice &lt;/em&gt; demonstrates again why reviewers and readers praise Scottoline's breakneck pacing, vivid characters and realistic dialogue, and why bar associations have used her books to examine legal and ethical issues in our systems of civil and criminal justice.</description>

  <description>Melinda Foster is already at a crossroads when the “for rent” sign beckons her down a dusty gravel lane. Facing forty and downsized from her successful career at a Twin Cities ad agency, Melinda is struggling to find her way forward when a phone call brings her home to rural Iowa. It’s not long before Melinda is living in a faded farmhouse, caring for a barn full of animals, and working at her family’s hardware store in the community of Prosper, whose motto is “The Great Little Town That Didn’t.” And just like the vast garden she tends under the summer sun, Melinda soon begins to thrive. Filled with memorable characters, from a big-hearted farm dog to the weather-obsessed owner of the local co-op, “Growing Season” celebrates the challenges and joys of rural life. &lt;b&gt;First in a series! Don't miss the heartwarming sequel, "Harvest Season."&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;For one couple, getting what they want comes at a devastating price in this gripping debut thriller.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banking heiress Trish and her husband, James, seem to have it all, from a lavish lifestyle to a historic mansion in the nation’s capital. The only thing that’s missing to make their family complete is a baby, so when Trish holds Anne Elise in her arms for the first time, it’s no surprise that she falls deeply in love. There’s just one problem: Trish isn’t the mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby belongs to Laurel, James’s young mistress. And more than that, James and Laurel want to start a new life together—despite an ironclad prenup standing in their way. When Trish becomes dangerously obsessed with making Laurel’s baby her own, the lovers’ plan to break James’s marriage quickly goes awry. How far is each of them willing to go for happiness?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.</description>

  <description>It's Nantucket wedding season, also known as summer-the sight of a bride racing down Main Street is as common as the sun setting at Madaket Beach. The Otis-Winbury wedding promises to be an event to remember: the groom's wealthy parents have spared no expense to host a lavish ceremony at their oceanfront estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's going to be memorable for all the wrong reasons after tragedy strikes: a body is discovered in Nantucket Harbor just hours before the ceremony-and everyone in the wedding party is suddenly a suspect. As Chief of Police Ed Kapenash interviews the bride, the groom, the groom's famous mystery-novelist mother, and even a member of his own family, he discovers that every wedding is a minefield-and no couple is perfect. Featuring beloved characters from The Castaways, Beautiful Day, and A Summer Affair, The Perfect Couple proves once again that Elin Hilderbrand is the queen of the summer beach read.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This mystery thriller reunites Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama for a political mashup full of suspense, intrigue, and laugh out loud bromance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vice President Joe Biden is fresh out of the Obama White House and feeling adrift when his favorite railroad conductor dies in a suspicious accident, leaving behind an ailing wife and a trail of clues. To unravel the mystery, “Amtrak Joe” re-teams with the only man he’s ever fully trusted—the 44th president of the United States. Together they’ll plumb the darkest corners of Delaware, traveling from cheap motels to biker bars and beyond, as they uncover the sinister forces advancing America’s opioid epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part noir thriller and part bromance novel, &lt;i&gt;Hope Never Dies&lt;/i&gt; is essentially the first published work of Obama/Biden fanfiction—and a cathartic read for anyone distressed by the current state of affairs.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, the powerful story of how a prominent white supremacist changed his heart and mind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Black grew up at the epicenter of white nationalism. His father founded Stormfront, the largest racist community on the internet. His godfather, David Duke, was a KKK Grand Wizard. By the time Derek turned nineteen, he had become an elected politician with his own daily radio show--already regarded as the "the leading light" of the burgeoning white nationalist movement. "We can infiltrate," Derek once told a crowd of white nationalists. "We can take the country back." Then he went to college. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek had been home-schooled by his parents, steeped in the culture of white supremacy, and he had rarely encountered diverse perspectives or direct outrage against his beliefs. At New College of Florida, he continued to broadcast his radio show in secret each morning, living a double life until a classmate uncovered his identity and sent an email to the entire school. "Derek Black...white supremacist, radio host...New College student???"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ensuing uproar overtook one of the most liberal colleges in the country. Some students protested Derek's presence on campus, forcing him to reconcile the ugliness his beliefs for the first time. Other students found the courage to reach out to him, including an Orthodox Jew who invited Derek to attend weekly Shabbat dinners. It was because of those dinners--and the wide-ranging relationships formed at that table--that Derek started to question the science, history, and prejudices behind his worldview. As white nationalism infiltrated the political mainstream, Derek decided to confront the damage he had done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising Out of Hatred&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of how white-supremacist ideas migrated from the far-right fringe to the White House through the intensely personal saga of one man who eventually disavowed everything he was taught to believe, at tremendous personal cost. With great empathy and narrative verve, Eli Saslow asks what Derek's story can tell us about America's increasingly divided nature. This is a book to help us understand the American moment and better understand one another.</description>

  <description>An internationally bestselling phenomenon: the darkly suspenseful, highly controversial tale of two families struggling to make the hardest decision of their lives - all over the course of one meal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a summer's evening in Amsterdam, and two couples meet at a fashionable restaurant for dinner. Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse - the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. The two boys are united by their accountability for a single horrific act; an act that has triggered a police investigation and shattered the comfortable, insulated worlds of their families. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children. As civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple show just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, The Dinner promises to be the topic of countless dinner party debates. Skewering everything from parenting values to pretentious menus to political convictions, this novel reveals the dark side of genteel society and asks what each of us would do in the face of unimaginable tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The classic multimillion copy bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delve into the magical, unforgettable world of James Herriot, the world's most beloved veterinarian, and his menagerie of heartwarming, funny, and tragic animal patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over forty years, generations of readers have thrilled to Herriot's marvelous tales, deep love of life, and extraordinary storytelling abilities. For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;All Creatures Great and Small&lt;/i&gt;, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals. From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals, Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world shine forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Herriot's memoirs have sold 80 million copies worldwide, and continue to delight and entertain readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>David Baldacci's remarkable detective Amos Decker - the man who can forget nothing - was first introduced in the sensational number-one New York Times best seller Memory Man. Now Decker returns in a stunning new novel.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fix &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter - a family man with a successful consulting business - and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government - or, worse, an international terrorist group - and an attack may be imminent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2017 David Baldacci (P)2017 Hachette Audio</description>

  <description>Nan Powell is a free-spirited, sixty-five-year-old widow who's not above skinny-dipping in her neighbors' pools when they're away and who dearly loves her Nantucket home. But when she discovers that the money she thought would last forever is dwindling, she realizes she must make drastic changes to save her beloved house. So Nan takes out an ad: Rooms to rent for the summer in a beautiful old Nantucket home with water views and direct access to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly people start moving in to the house, filling it with noise, laughter, and with tears. As the house comes alive again, Nan finds her family and friends expanding. Her son comes home for the summer, and then an unexpected visitor turns all their lives upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As she did so masterfully in her numerous &lt;b&gt;NY Times&lt;/b&gt; bestselling novels, including &lt;b&gt;Second Chance, Jane Green&lt;/b&gt; once again proves herself one of the preeminent writers of contemporary women's fiction.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Young and ambitious, Greta arrives ready to be a bride, but Mr. Marston isn’t so sure about this arrangement. Will he finally cave-in…just in time for a Christmas wedding?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greta Samuelson was only fourteen the year Kansas bled, but by the time the Civil War had ended, she was a woman of steel. The war had left only broken pieces of men for single women to comb through, so there wasn’t much for her in Atchison, Kansas. She longs to go west where her brother is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the wagon train driver arrives in town, he’s got a letter he wants her to see. It’s from a schoolteacher announcing his desire for a wife, primarily asking for a woman of good composure, strong sensibilities and sufficient education to assist him. Greta has not had a great deal of formal education, but she has a good writing hand, and sends back a letter saying she is interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Marston first meets Greta, he is disappointed. He had expected a mature, scholarly woman, not a mere slip of a twenty-year-old girl. Greta, however, sets out to prove she is a woman to contend with, even for a thirty-two-year-old teacher. She rolls up her sleeves and takes on the Wild West with as much fortitude as she had shown while living through the Civil War. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But can she win Marston’s heart in time to be a Christmas bride? Or will he decide she is too young for him… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR’S NOTE: Enjoy this clean historical western romance short story! I have plans to turn it into a series to keep you happily reading. Also included are 3 bonus stories! Don’t miss out on this one…it’s one of my best written stories yet! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An anonymous tip about a crime in Upper Manhattan proves to be a set-up, taking an officer down-and it's not Michael Bennett. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of New York's top cop is not the only one at risk. One of Bennett's children sustains a mysterious injury. And a series of murders follows, each with a distinct signature, alerting Bennet to the presence of a professional killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Investigators chase leads that turn out to be phantoms, and this master killer entices one officer into compromising Bennett. He then goes a step further, luring another member of Bennett's family into even graver danger. Michael Bennett can't untangle what's driving the assassin-but he can tell it's personal. And he needs to determine exactly how he figures in the killer's logic, before there is one fewer Bennett in the world.</description>

  <description>An addictive psychological thriller about a group of women whose lives become unexpectedly connected when one of their newborns goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call themselves the May Mothers—a collection of new moms who gave birth in the same month. Twice a week, with strollers in tow, they get together in Prospect Park, seeking refuge from the isolation of new motherhood; sharing the fears, joys, and anxieties of their new child-centered lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the group’s members agree to meet for drinks at a hip local bar, they have in mind a casual evening of fun, a brief break from their daily routine. But on this sultry Fourth of July night during the hottest summer in Brooklyn’s history, something goes terrifyingly wrong: one of the babies is abducted from his crib. Winnie, a single mom, was reluctant to leave six-week-old Midas with a babysitter, but the May Mothers insisted that everything would be fine. Now Midas is missing, the police are asking disturbing questions, and Winnie’s very private life has become fodder for a ravenous media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though none of the other members in the group are close to the reserved Winnie, three of them will go to increasingly risky lengths to help her find her son. And as the police bungle the investigation and the media begin to scrutinize the mothers in the days that follow, damaging secrets are exposed, marriages are tested, and friendships are formed and fractured.</description>

  <description>Whether it’s repairing a home or taking care of clients’ &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; needs, Twin Cities handyman Sam Haney is in demand from his mostly female clientele. Despite Sam’s lothario reputation, love isn’t part of his portfolio. He’s built a lot of walls in his time, but the one that’s surrounded his heart ever since the death of his parents is his most solid yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haley Cooper has had enough heartache for a lifetime. Her high school sweetheart up and moved to Indonesia—&lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;—just two weeks before their wedding. Her mother thinks it’s time for Haley to move on and contracts Sam to work on Haley’s wreck of a house—and anything else, if he’s got the notion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly and passion ignites. But Haley isn’t into Sam’s love-’em-and-leave-’em act. She wants something more. Fixing a house is one thing, but for this handyman, building a relationship will need a whole different set of skills.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15994201-the-last-season-the-story-of-a-marriage" rel="nofollow"&gt;B0093TX0VK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happens when a successful, determined middle-aged man falls in love with a woman who has been happily married for twenty-seven years? If he's Avery Laird, he hires her to work for him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buddy Middleton is positive that the job his wife, Ginger, is offered is too good to be true, that Avery Laird has an ulterior motive, but he can't prove it. When Buddy voices his doubts and urges her not to take it, he makes Ginger feel as though she isn't worth the offer. Determined to prove him wrong, Ginger goes to work for Laird and saves him over half a million dollars in the first real estate deal she handles for his company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flush with success, Ginger believes that the problems she and Buddy had are over. But then they have an unexpected guest from the past, a fellow named Hoot with whom Buddy played professional baseball when they were newly married. Hoot tells Ginger the true reason Buddy quit baseball, a subject they had always avoided. When Ginger confronts Buddy with what she has learned, trouble really begins... and Avery is there waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a novel about marriage, about what can happen when you've made your adjustments to each other and you think your lives are just about perfect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From neuroscientist and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Still Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful exploration of regret, forgiveness, freedom, and what it means to be alive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accomplished concert pianist, Richard received standing ovations from audiences all over the world in awe of his rare combination of emotional resonance and flawless technique. Every finger of his hands was a finely calibrated instrument, dancing across the keys and striking each note with exacting precision. That was eight months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard now has ALS, and his entire right arm is paralyzed. His fingers are impotent, still, devoid of possibility. The loss of his hand feels like a death, a loss of true love, a divorce—his divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows his left arm will go next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, Karina removed their framed wedding picture from the living room wall and hung a mirror there instead. But she still hasn’t moved on. Karina is paralyzed by excuses and fear, stuck in an unfulfilling life as a piano teacher, afraid to pursue the path she abandoned as a young woman, blaming Richard and their failed marriage for all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Richard becomes increasingly paralyzed and is no longer able to live on his own, Karina becomes his reluctant caretaker. As Richard’s muscles, voice, and breath fade, both he and Karina try to reconcile their past before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Every Note Played &lt;/i&gt;is a masterful exploration of redemption and what it means to find peace inside of forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Redefine the expectations for women in leadership roles with this #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling volume of inspiring advice by the former communications director for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Framed as an empowering letter from former Hillary Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri to the first woman president, and by extension, to all women working to succeed in any field, &lt;i&gt;Dear Madam President&lt;/i&gt; is filled with forward-thinking, practical advice for all women who are determined to seize control of their lives-from boardroom to living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a country, we haven't wrapped our heads around what it should look like for a woman to be in the job of President. Our only models are men. While wildly disappointed by the outcome of the 2016 election, Palmieri argues that our feelings-confusion, love, hate, acceptance-can now open the country up to reimagining women in leadership roles. And that is what Palmieri takes on in this book-redefining expectations for women looking to lead and creating a blueprint for women candidates and leaders to follow. &lt;i&gt;Dear Madam President &lt;/i&gt;will turn the results of the 2016 election into something incredibly empowering for graduates, future female leaders, and independent thinkers everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jodi Picoult tackles issues of race and privilege in this ebook original short story, a prequel to her upcoming novel &lt;i&gt;Small Great Things&lt;/i&gt;. In “Shine,” the master storyteller and #1 New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Leaving Time&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;My Sister’s Keeper&lt;/i&gt; introduces readers to the unforgettable Ruth Brooks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today is Ruth’s first day of third grade at Dalton. The prestigious institution on New York’s Upper East Side couldn’t be more different from her old school in Harlem. Despite being the smartest girl in her grade, Ruth suspects that her classmates and teachers only see her dark skin. She also notices that Christina, the daughter of her mother’s employer, treats Ruth very differently when they’re hanging out with the popular girls rather than playing together. Ruth must navigate between two worlds, never losing sight of the dreams she has for herself—in hopes that someday, someone will see her for who she really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes a preview of Jodi Picoult’s highly anticipated new novel, &lt;i&gt;Small Great Things&lt;i&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved Jodi‘s book, Small Great Things. When I read that this was a snippet into Ruth’s childhood I really wanted to read it. It was excellent and I liked reading about Ruth as a child. I only wish that it had been hundreds of pages longer so I could have gotten to know little Ruth better.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention and you might solve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.&lt;br /&gt; Bronwyn, &lt;b&gt;the brain, &lt;/b&gt; is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. &lt;br /&gt; Addy, &lt;b&gt; the beauty, &lt;/b&gt; is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. &lt;br /&gt; Nate, &lt;b&gt;the criminal&lt;/b&gt;, is already on probation for dealing.&lt;br /&gt; Cooper, &lt;b&gt;the athlete&lt;/b&gt;, is the all-star baseball pitcher.&lt;br /&gt; And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Simon, &lt;b&gt; the outcast&lt;/b&gt;, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention, Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An A-List Movie Star. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Ryan Christensen just wanted to be an actor. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine a life where fans would chase him, paparazzi would stalk him, and Hollywood studios would want to own him. While filming in Seaport, Rhode Island, Ryan ducks into a neighborhood bar for a quick escape from legions of screaming fans . . . and finds much more than he expected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Small-Town Girl. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Nursing a recent heartbreak, Taryn Mitchell believes men are best kept at a safe distance. But when Ryan Christensen unexpectedly bursts through the front door of her pub, she can’t help but be drawn in by his humor, charm, and undeniable good looks. At six foot two, with dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and an incredible body, Ryan has every girl in Seaport swooning. But Taryn isn’t every other girl.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Relationship That Doesn’t Follow the Script. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Despite her better judgment, Taryn soon finds herself falling hard for Ryan. But is their bond strong enough to survive the tabloid headlines, the relentless paparazzi, and the jealous fans who seem determined to tear them apart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;David Baldacci returns with the next blockbuster thriller in his #1 New York Times bestselling Memory Man series featuring detective Amos Decker--the man who can forget nothing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker and his journalist friend Alex Jamison are visiting the home of Alex's sister in Barronville, a small town in western Pennsylvania that has been hit hard economically. When Decker is out on the rear deck of the house talking with Alex's niece, a precocious eight-year-old, he notices flickering lights and then a spark of flame in the window of the house across the way. When he goes to investigate he finds two dead bodies inside and it's not clear how either man died. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. There's something going on in Barronville that might be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with a stonewalling local police force, and roadblocks put up by unseen forces, Decker and Jamison must pull out all the stops to solve the case. And even Decker's infallible memory may not be enough to save them.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book didn't thrill me like it did everyone else in the world. But that may be because I read it very quickly after having read 'Where the Crawdad's Sing' and it was very similar in some ways. In some ways it was very different but I guess it was too close, too soon. Also, I just can find no...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I’m letting my guard down.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of &lt;i&gt;What Happened&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. &lt;i&gt;What Happened &lt;/i&gt;is the story of that campaign and its aftermath—both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one has set foot on Earth in centuries -- until now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been 21 days since the hundred landed on Earth. They're the only humans to set foot on the planet in centuries...or so they thought. Facing an unknown enemy, Wells attempts to keep the group together. Clarke strikes out for Mount Weather, in search of other Colonists, while Bellamy is determined to rescue his sister, no matter the cost. And back on the ship, Glass faces an unthinkable choice between the love of her life and life itself.&lt;br /&gt;In this pulse-pounding sequel to Kass Morgan's &lt;i&gt;The 100&lt;/i&gt;, secrets are revealed, beliefs are challenged, and relationships are tested. And the hundred will struggle to survive the only way they can -- together.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling and creepy photo-novel perfect for fans of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller&lt;em&gt; Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sixteen-year-old Dan Crawford, New Hampshire College Prep is more than a summer program—it's a lifeline. An outcast at his high school, Dan is excited to finally make some friends in his last summer before college. But when he arrives at the program, Dan learns that his dorm for the summer used to be a sanatorium, more commonly known as an asylum. And not just any asylum—a last resort for the criminally insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dan and his new friends, Abby and Jordan, explore the hidden recesses of their creepy summer home, they soon discover it's no coincidence that the three of them ended up here. Because the asylum holds the key to a terrifying past. And there are some secrets that refuse to stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring found photos of unsettling history and real abandoned asylums and filled with chilling mystery and page-turning suspense, Madeleine Roux's teen debut, &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, is a horror story that treads the line between genius and insanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one has set foot on Earth in centuries—until now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since a devastating nuclear war, humanity has lived on spaceships far above Earth's radioactive surface. Now, one hundred juvenile delinquents—considered expendable by society—are being sent on a dangerous mission: to recolonize the planet. It could be their second chance at life...or it could be a suicide mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLARKE was arrested for treason, though she's haunted by the memory of what she really did. WELLS, the chancellor's son, came to Earth for the girl he loves—but will she ever forgive him? Reckless BELLAMY fought his way onto the transport pod to protect his sister, the other half of the only pair of siblings in the universe. And GLASS managed to escape back onto the ship, only to find that life there is just as dangerous as she feared it would be on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confronted with a savage land and haunted by secrets from their pasts, the hundred must fight to survive. They were never meant to be heroes, but they may be mankind's last hope.</description>

I see several directions the story may go and I want to see what happens. I'll definitely check out the TV series too. It may be easier to keep track of the many characters if I can...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place.&lt;/b&gt; The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

This book had excitement, nostalgia, heart and important lessons for us all about acceptance, friendship, and love. I highly recommend it even if you are not a video game person. (I am not).

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautiful, raw and compassionate memoir about identity, love and understanding. Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, directed by Joel Edgerton. “Every sentence of the story will stir your soul” &lt;i&gt;(O Magazine)&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to “cure” him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.</description>

  <description>An irresistible story from Kasie West that explores the timeless question: What do you do when you fall for the person you least expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Autumn Collins finds herself accidentally locked in the library for an entire weekend, she doesn't think things could get any worse. But that's before she realizes that Dax Miller is locked in with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autumn doesn't know much about Dax except that he's trouble. Between the rumors about the fight he was in (and that brief stint in juvie that followed it) and his reputation as a loner, he's not exactly the ideal person to be stuck with. Still, she just keeps reminding herself that it is only a matter of time before Jeff, her almost-boyfriend, realizes he left her in the library and comes to rescue her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only he doesn't come. No one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it becomes clear that Autumn is going to have to spend the next couple of days living off vending-machine food and making conversation with a boy who clearly wants nothing to do with her. Except there is more to Dax than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he and Autumn at first grudgingly, and then not so grudgingly, open up to each other, Autumn is struck by their surprising connection. But can their feelings for each other survive once the weekend is over and Autumn's old life, and old love interest, threaten to pull her from Dax's side?</description>

  <description>After trying every diet program imaginable--from Atkins to Optifast--media giant and self-confessed junk-food junkie Oprah Winfrey met personal trainer and exercise physiologist Bob Greene. The rest is talk-show history. (Who can forget seeing Oprah wheeling that wagon of fat onstage?) Instead of fad diets, fasts, and quick fixes, Greene taught Oprah how to eat right and exercise regularly. He helped her lose more than 70 pounds and changed her life forever.&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Make the Connection&lt;/i&gt;, Greene tells you how to lose weight the Oprah way: with hard work that includes a sensible diet and daily workouts. He gives 10 steps that he believes are the fastest and most effective ways to increase your metabolism and decrease your weight. You'll also learn why we eat, how to become self-aware, the purpose of body fat, and the physics of body weight. To keep you motivated, Oprah shares her personal shape-up story and offers suggestions for sticking with the program. &lt;i&gt;Make the Connection&lt;/i&gt; is about more than shedding pounds. It is also about making a daily commitment to take care of your body and feel better about yourself. &lt;i&gt;--Ellen Albertson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For Ta-Nehisi Coates, history has always been personal. At every stage of his life, he's sought in his explorations of history answers to the mysteries that surrounded him -- most urgently, why he, and other black people he knew, seemed to live in fear. What were they afraid of? Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's 'long war on black people,' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. In his trademark style -- a mix of lyrical personal narrative, reimagined history, essayistic argument, and reportage -- Coates provides readers a thrillingly illuminating new framework for understanding race: its history, our contemporary dilemma, and where we go from here.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN: 1456414143 (ISBN13: 9781456414146).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelby Nichols is an average woman who is married to the only guy she ever fell for. Her life is organized and predictable, revolving around her husband and two children. All that changes the day she stops at the grocery store for some carrots. As the cashier rings up her purchases, a gunman is busy robbing the bank inside the store. When a customer grabs the robber's mask, he is shot and everyone runs for cover. Everyone except Shelby, who finds herself face to face with the killer. The next thing she knows, she's lying on the floor with a bullet wound to her head. Luckily, the bullet only grazes her scalp, and she doesn't suspect any lasting affects until later, when she suddenly 'hears' what people are thinking. With this uncanny ability, her life takes on a whole new dimension. Her kids think she's bossy and too old to understand them, but that's nothing compared to her husband. He says he loves her, but what is it about the redhead at work that he doesn't want her to know? As if that isn't enough, the gunman knows she can identify him, and he's out to silence her forever. In her fight to stay alive, she is saved from certain death by a handsome hit-man with ties to organized crime. This pulls Shelby even deeper into danger, where knowing someone's thoughts can not only hurt her feelings, but get her killed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Jojo Moyes, a new book featuring her iconic heroine of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;After You&lt;/i&gt;, Louisa Clark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa Clark arrives in New York ready to start a new life, confident that she can embrace this new adventure and keep her relationship with Ambulance Sam alive across several thousand miles. She steps into the world of the superrich, working for Leonard Gopnik and his much younger second wife, Agnes. Lou is determined to get the most out of the experience and throws herself into her new job and New York life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she begins to mix in New York high society, Lou meets Joshua Ryan, a man who brings with him a whisper of her past. Before long, Lou finds herself torn between Fifth Avenue where she works and the treasure-filled vintage clothing store where she actually feels at home. And when matters come to a head, she has to ask herself: Who is Louisa Clark? And how do you find the courage to follow your heart—wherever that may lead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, romantic, and poignant, &lt;i&gt;Still Me&lt;/i&gt; follows Lou as she navigates how to stay true to herself, while pushing to live boldly in her brave new world.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was my 2nd favorite of the series. Louisa is such a likable character. I see some of me in her. She is really a nurturer. I am glad she learned how to care for herself! I did like the ending but I don't want to ruin it. :-)]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of &lt;i&gt;Girls Trip&lt;/i&gt;, Tiffany Haddish, comes&lt;i&gt; The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt;, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.</description>

  <description>Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story of survival and of transformation, this riveting book has sparked many a reader's interest in venturing into the wild.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times Bestseller. Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA’s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America’s space program. Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as ‘Human Computers’, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these ‘coloured computers’ used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets and astronauts, into space. Moving from World War II through NASA’s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War and the women’s rights movement, ‘Hidden Figures’ interweaves a rich history of mankind’s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</description>

  <description>From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the groundbreaking backstairs look at the White House, The Residence, comes an intimate, news-making look at the true modern power brokers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: the First Ladies, from Jackie Kennedy to Michelle Obama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most underestimated—and challenging—positions in the world, the First Lady of the United States must be many things: an inspiring leader with a forward-thinking agenda of her own; a savvy politician, skilled at navigating the treacherous rapids of Washington; a wife and mother operating under constant scrutiny; and an able CEO responsible for the smooth operation of countless services and special events at the White House. Now, as she did in her smash #1 bestseller The Residence, former White House correspondent Kate Andersen Brower draws on a wide array of untapped, candid sources—from residence staff and social secretaries to friends and political advisers—to tell the stories of the ten remarkable women who have defined that role since 1960.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brower offers new insights into this privileged group of remarkable women, including Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. The stories she shares range from the heartwarming to the shocking and tragic, exploring everything from the first ladies’ political crusades to their rivalries with Washington figures; from their friendships with other first ladies to their public and private relationships with their husbands. She also offers a detailed and insightful new portrait of one of the most-watched first ladies of all time, Hillary Clinton, asking what her tumultuous years in the White House may tell us about her own historic presidential run . . . and what life could be like with the nation’s first First Husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candid and illuminating, this first group biography of the modern first ladies provides a revealing look at life upstairs and downstairs at the world’s most powerful address.</description>

  <description>’Tis the season for romance, second chances, and Christmas cheer with this new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Carrie Slayton, a big-city society-page columnist, longs to write more serious news stories. So her editor hands her a challenge: She can cover any topic she wants, but only if she first scores the paper an interview with Finn Dalton, the notoriously reclusive author. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Living in the remote Alaskan wilderness, Finn has written a megabestselling memoir about surviving in the wild. But he stubbornly declines to speak to anyone in the press, and no one even knows exactly where he lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Digging deep into Finn’s past, Carrie develops a theory on his whereabouts. It is the holidays, but her career is at stake, so she forsakes her family celebrations and flies out to snowy Alaska. When she finally finds Finn, she discovers a man both more charismatic and more stubborn than she even expected. And soon she is torn between pursuing the story of a lifetime and following her heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Filled with all the comforts and joys of Christmastime, Starry Night is a delightful novel of finding happiness in the most surprising places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beloved #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber celebrates the most wonderful time of the year in this heartwarming Christmas novel of romance, hope, and the comforts of home—coming soon as a Hallmark Channel original movie!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harry Mills is a guardian angel on a mission: help twenty-four-year-old Addie Folsom get her life back on track—and, if the right moment strikes, help her find love. Posing as a teacher at a local college in Tacoma, Washington, Harry is up to the task, but not even he can predict the surprises that lay in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to make it on her own, Addie has returned home to Tacoma for the holidays, but this time she plans to stay for good, enrolling in the local community college to earn her degree. What she doesn’t plan to do is run into Erich Simmons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie and her next-door neighbor, Erich, are like night and day. Growing up, he was popular and outgoing while she was rebellious and headstrong, and he never missed an opportunity to tease her. Now she intends to avoid him entirely, yet when they’re suddenly forced to spend Christmas together, Addie braces for trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it’s the spirit of the season or the magic of mistletoe, but Addie and Erich soon find they have more in common than they thought—and that two people who seem so wrong for each other may actually be just right. With a little prompting from a certain angelic teacher, the two are in for a holiday miracle they’ll never forget.</description>

  <description>Short, emotional, literary, powerful―&lt;i&gt;Tears We Cannot Stop&lt;/i&gt; is the book that all Americans who care about the current and long-burning crisis in race relations will want to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the country grapples with racist division at a level not seen since the 1960s, one man's voice soars above the rest with conviction and compassion. In his 2016 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; op-ed piece "Death in Black and White," Michael Eric Dyson moved a nation. Now he continues to speak out in &lt;i&gt;Tears We Cannot Stop&lt;/i&gt;―a provocative and deeply personal call for change. Dyson argues that if we are to make real racial progress we must face difficult truths, including being honest about how black grievance has been ignored, dismissed, or discounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The time is at hand for reckoning with the past, recognizing the truth of the present, and moving together to redeem the nation for our future. If we don't act now, if you don't address race immediately, there very well may be no future&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by the life of a real World War II heroine, this debut novel reveals a story of love, redemption, and secrets that were hidden for decades.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline’s world is forever changed when Hitler’s army invades Poland in September 1939—and then sets its sights on France.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For the ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.</description>

  <description>As a creative force, student of the human heart and soul, and champion of living the life you want, Oprah Winfrey stands alone. Over the years, she has made history with a legendary talk show - the highest-rated program of its kind, launched her own television network, become the nation's only African-American billionaire, and been awarded both an honorary degree by Harvard University and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. From all her experiences, she has gleaned life lessons—which, for fourteen years, she's shared in &lt;i&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine's&lt;/i&gt; widely popular "What I Know For Sure" column, a monthly source of inspiration and revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time, these thoughtful gems have been revised, updated, and collected in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure,&lt;/i&gt; a beautiful cloth bound book with a ribbon marker, packed with insight and revelation from Oprah Winfrey. Organized by theme—joy, resilience, connection, gratitude, possibility, awe, clarity, and power—these essays offer a rare, powerful and intimate glimpse into the heart and mind of one of the world's most extraordinary women—while providing readers a guide to becoming their best selves. Candid, moving, exhilarating, uplifting, and frequently humorous, the words Oprah shares in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure&lt;/i&gt; shimmer with the sort of truth that readers will turn to again and again.</description>

  <description>13 hours, 18 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book from Ruth Bader Ginsburg since becoming a Supreme Court Justice in 1993—a witty, engaging, serious, and playful collection of writings and speeches from the woman who has had a powerful and enduring influence on law, women’s rights, and popular culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Own Words&lt;/i&gt; offers Justice Ginsburg on wide-ranging topics, including gender equality, the workways of the Supreme Court, being Jewish, law and lawyers in opera, and the value of looking beyond US shores when interpreting the US Constitution. Throughout her life Justice Ginsburg has been (and continues to be) a prolific writer and public speaker. This book’s sampling is selected by Justice Ginsburg and her authorized biographers Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams. Justice Ginsburg has written an introduction to the book, and Hartnett and Williams introduce each chapter, giving biographical context and quotes gleaned from hundreds of interviews they have conducted. This is a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of America’s most influential women.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Continuing in a festive annual tradition, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber returns with a new original holiday novel full of romance and cheer—and the magical prospect of finding love in the most unexpected places.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Friendly and bubbly, Julia Padden likes nearly everyone, but her standoffish neighbor, Cain Maddox, presents a particular challenge. No matter how hard she’s tried to be nice, Cain rudely rebuffs her at every turn, preferring to keep to himself. But when Julia catches Cain stealing her newspaper from the lobby of their apartment building, that’s the last straw. She’s going to break through Cain’s Scrooge-like exterior the only way she knows how: by killing him with kindness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To track her progress, Julia starts a blog called The Twelve Days of Christmas. Her first attempts to humanize Cain are far from successful. Julia brings him homemade Christmas treats and the disagreeable grinch won’t even accept them. Meanwhile, Julie’s blog becomes an online sensation, as an astonishing number of people start following her adventures. Julia continues to find ways to express kindness and, little by little, chips away at Cain’s gruff façade to reveal the caring man underneath. Unbelievably, Julia feels herself falling for Cain—and she suspects that he may be falling for her as well. But as the popularity of her blog continues to grow, Julia must decide if telling Cain the truth about having chronicled their relationship to the rest of the world is worth risking their chance at love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He will do anything to make amends... But how can she forgive him when she can't even remember him? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam did not realize how serious Winter's injuries were after her accident. He was beside himself with grief when she fell unconscious and wouldn't wake up. &lt;br /&gt;After a minor coma, Winter finally wakes up to a world she can partially see — and she has no clue why. She does not remember her eye surgery, and she has no idea who Liam is. In fact, she does not remember the last three years of her life. She even insists on being called Helen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam feels lucky that Helen doesn't remember his recently exposed lies — he feels like he has been given a second chance to make things right. But without her memories of the horrible things that happened to her, Helen seems like a different person and Liam finds himself struggling to connect with her. Can he cope with the guilt of the harm that he's caused her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And can he make a headstrong and carefree Helen fall in love with him all over again?</description>

  <description>After many years of darkness, Winter never thought that she'd be happy or safe again. Her whole world changed when she met Liam Larson, a charming young doctor determined to be her knight in shining armor. When a brutal night unleashes vicious reminders of her past, Winter must struggle to hold on to the little bit of happiness she has found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When everything begins to fall apart, Liam's strength and kindness might not be enough to save her. Battling with the betrayal of her family, terrifying nightmares, and frequent reminders of her enemy that make daily life difficult, Winter's first instinct is to run away. She is tired of being the victim and living in a cruel, crowded city where she doesn't feel like she belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Liam promises her that if she only trusts him, he can change everything. And that's exactly what he attempts to do, starting with an operation to heal her eyes, and then her heart...</description>

      <![CDATA[I really, really wanted to like this book/series. It seemed like it was going to be about a strong, intelligent woman who happened to have a visual impairment. But I can't like it. For several reasons, I just hate it. Forget the part about her lover lieing to her. I guess that can be just a plot...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Savor the magic of the season with #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber’s newest Christmas novel, filled with warmth, humor, the promise of love, and a dash of unexpected adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashley Davison, a graduate student in California, desperately wants to spend the holidays with her family in Seattle. Dashiell Sutherland, a former army intelligence officer, has a job interview in Seattle and must arrive by December 23. Though frantic to book a last-minute flight out of San Francisco, both are out of luck: Every flight is full, and there’s only one rental car available. Ashley and Dash reluctantly decide to share the car, but neither anticipates the wild ride ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first they drive in silence, but forced into close quarters Ashley and Dash can’t help but open up. Not only do they find they have a lot in common, but there’s even a spark of romance in the air. Their feelings catch them off guard—never before has either been so excited about a first meeting. But the two are in for more twists and turns along the way as they rescue a lost puppy, run into petty thieves, and even get caught up in a case of mistaken identity. Though Ashley and Dash may never reach Seattle in time for Christmas, the season is still full of surprises—and their greatest wishes may yet come true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Helen Winters was living a lonely existence when the charming Dr. Liam Larson coaxed her out of solitude with the promise of healing her sightless eyes. She was hopeful at the prospect of gaining vision for the first time and being reunited with her family. She was also growing somewhat fond of the persuasive young doctor. For the first time in years, she was being magnetically drawn to a new friend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then everything came crashing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plunged into a hellish nightmare, Helen is forced to face the same evils she ran away to escape so long ago. She is unprepared to have her hopes crushed and her peace destroyed. She finds herself living in constant terror and drowning in fear--and Liam's voice is the only thing that can keep her afloat. His comforting touch becomes the only light in her pitch-black darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen has always been a tough girl who relied only on herself. But this time, she can't survive alone. Due to the horrors of her past, Helen has promised herself not to trust anyone. When her life becomes unbearable, how can she trust Liam enough to let him save her?</description>

  <description>Fiercely independent Helen Winters was born completely blind, but she vowed never to let her disability keep her down. She did not expect a traumatic event to devastate her life and force her to drop out of college. Disillusioned by the cruelty of people, Helen retreated from society to live by herself as a reclusive writer in the woods—where no one could ever hurt her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a brilliant young doctor shows up on her doorstep, promising her that his new research can give her the ability to see for the first time, Helen stubbornly refuses. She has learned not to trust anyone, and to rely only on herself. But Dr. Liam Larson will not take no for an answer. He makes it his personal mission to rescue Helen from her loneliness, and bring joy into her world once more—the joy she has denied herself for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Helen’s demons come racing back into her life, threatening to rip her apart and destroy the strength she has carefully rebuilt, Liam is the only one who might be able to save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he reach the broken girl in time, helping her to heal and see the world in a different light? Or will Helen’s grief send her spiraling out of control, lost to him forever?</description>

  <description>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?&lt;p&gt;Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.</description>

  <description>All I Want For Christmas is a short story all about love and finding your way home. All royalties received from Amazon will go directly to the Disasters Emergency Committee Charity for the Philippines Disaster Fund.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was written collectively by members of the Imagine, Write, Inspire Group. The story was compiled by Author Carmel Harrington who wrote the multi-award winning Beyond Grace's Rainbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Christmas Eve at Dublin Airport, the busiest day of the year for ground hostesses Holly and Lorna. Hapless Holly only wants one thing for Christmas - to win the heart of sexy pilot Luke. But despite her best efforts it looks like it will be another lonesome Christmas, spent pulling crackers with her hilarious parents Stephanie and Frank. Lorna meanwhile is counting down the weeks till her fiancee Matt finally gets home from South Lebanon where he is stationed with the Irish Army.&lt;br /&gt;As Holly tries to keep on the right side of her hard-to-please supervisor Norma, will her Christmas wish finally come true?&lt;br /&gt;All I Want For Christmas is a funny, light-hearted and often poignant tale of love, family and friendship, written beautifully by the Imagine, Write, Inspire Group. It will leave you smiling and looking for more! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the small town of Grandon, five very different people discover the true meaning of Christmas. Jennifer and Ryan are both single parents, struggling with their own losses and heartache as they attempt to move forward in the present while still holding onto the memories, joy, and heartache of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Kaylee is faced with a life-changing situation that has affected her whole family. Stephen and Lily are happily married and ready to start a family. All of them are facing their own struggles, and all are finding their way through the dark. When they are brought together for a rather unconventional church Nativity, they will learn that with strength, courage, and love, there is always hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the beloved &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Hope&lt;/i&gt; series returns with this new heartwarming, inspirational story about the power of love and faith to reveal the possibilities that lay right in front of you.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, young Nathan Andrews was a child who lost his mother to cancer. Now his deepest wish is to become a doctor. When a stranger named Robert gave him the money to buy his mother a pair of shoes for her last Christmas, both Robert and Nathan learned the deepest lessons of love and giving. Now a medical student in his third year, Nathan realizes there are still things to be learned about faith, blessings, and sacrifice. Lessons he will learn from Meghan Sullivan-a young woman born with a hole in her heart that has not kept her from becoming a champion runner. And lessons learned from a young boy named Charlie, who teaches how to live a life of true courage. Together, they will help guide Nathan through the darkest period in his life. &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Blessing&lt;/i&gt; is an inspiring about hope existing in the darkest places, and love is always the greatest gift of all.</description>

  <description>Laughs abound in this bestselling Christmas classic by Barbara Robinson! &lt;em&gt;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&lt;/em&gt; follows the outrageous shenanigans of the Herdman siblings, or “the worst kids in the history of the world.” The siblings take over the annual Christmas pageant in a hilarious yet heartwarming tale involving the Three Wise Men, a ham, scared shepherds, and six rowdy kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph, Imogene, Leroy, Claude, Ollie, and Gladys Herdman are an awful bunch. They set fire to Fred Shoemaker’s toolshed, blackmailed Wanda Pierce to get her charm bracelet, and smacked Alice Wendelken across the head. And that’s just the start! When the Herdmans show up at church for the free snacks and suddenly take over the Christmas pageant, the other kids are shocked. It’s obvious that they’re up to no good. But Christmas magic is all around and the Herdmans, who have never heard the Christmas story before, start to reimagine it in their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year’s pageant is definitely like no other, but maybe that’s exactly what makes it so special.</description>

  <description>This poem first appeared in a newspaper in Troy, New York, USA, on December 23, 1823, as "A Visit From St. Nicholas". No one claimed authorship until 13 years later. Clement Clarke Moore, a professor and poet, said that he wrote the piece for his children. Unbeknownst to him, his housekeeper had sent it to the newspaper to be published. However, the family of Henry Livingston Jr. contended that their father had been reciting “A Visit from St. Nicholas” for 15 years prior to publication. Regardless of the true author, the poem is now a Christmas classic.</description>

  <description>London, 1944. Two young nurses meet at a train station with a common purpose: to join the war effort. Scarlet longs for the chance to find her missing fiancé, Thomas, and to prove to her family—and to herself—that she’s stronger than everybody thinks. Nursing is in Ellie’s blood, but her humble background is vastly different from Scarlet’s privileged upbringing. Though Ellie puts on a brave face, she’s just as nervous as Scarlet about what awaits them in France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Normandy, the two friends soon encounter the seemingly unflappable Lucy. Scarlet and Ellie are in awe of her courage and competence, but the experienced nurse is well aware of the dangers of the job they’ve chosen—and even she is terrified they won’t make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushed to their limits by the brutality of a world at war, Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy will need to rely on each other—and the power of their friendship—to survive.</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1974.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.&lt;br /&gt;For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The Great Alone is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.</description>

  <description>Jonathan Beecher, a middle-aged widower and small-town store owner, has never asked for much. But lately, all too much is being asked of him. The bombing of Pearl Harbor plunges America into World War II and deeply fractures Jonathan’s own family. His eldest son, a civilian contractor, is trapped on a Japanese-occupied island in the Pacific. Jonathan’s feckless younger son ignores his father’s pleas to stay home and joins the army. And his bright, devoted daughter, who Jonathan hoped would go to college, elopes with a brutally abusive man instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan has always met adversity with quiet faith, but as his emotional and financial losses accumulate, so do his doubts. In the midst of his pain, Sarah, a widow herself, emerges as a kind, compelling friend. Powerfully drawn to Sarah, Jonathan struggles to remain true to his late wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James D. Shipman’s tender, wise novel examines the paradox of human suffering: how irrevocable loss, if we are willing to let it, begets spiritual gain.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;James Patterson’s BookShots. Short, fast-paced, high-impact entertainment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Make believe I love you…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both survivors of the divorce wars, Christy and Martin don’t believe in love at first sight and certainly not on a first date. But from the instant they lock eyes, life becomes a sexy, romantic dream come true. That is, until they start playing a strangely intense game of make-believe – a game that’s about to go too far.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Boston, a young woman finds herself pregnant--even though she is still a virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Ireland, another young woman discovers she is in the same impossible condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in cities all around the world, medical authorities are overwhelmed by epidemics, droughts, famines, floods, and worse. It all feels like a sign that something awful is coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Fitzgerald, a former nun turned private investigator, is hired by the Archdiocese of Boston to investigate the immaculate conceptions. Even as she comes to care about and trust the young women, she realizes that both are in great danger. Terrifying forces of light and darkness are gathering. Stepping into uncharted territory where the unknown is just the beginning, Anne must discover the truth--to save the young women, to save herself, and to protect the future of all mankind.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Memphis, 1939. Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family’s Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge—until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents—but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility’s cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiken, South Carolina, present day. Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fiancé, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Dorothea Benton Frank returns to her magical Lowcountry of South Carolina in this bewitching story of marriage, love, family, and friendship that is infused with her warm and engaging earthy humor and generous heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One enchanted summer, two couples begin a friendship that will last more than twenty years and transform their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance meeting on the Isle of Palms, one of Charleston’s most stunning barrier islands, brings former sweethearts, Adam Stanley and Eve Landers together again. Their respective spouses, Eliza and Carl, fight sparks of jealousy flaring from their imagined rekindling of old flames. As Adam and Eve get caught up on their lives, their partners strike up a deep friendship—and flirt with an unexpected attraction—of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Year after year, Adam, Eliza, Eve, and Carl eagerly await their reunion at Wild Dunes, a condominium complex at the island’s tip end, where they grow closer with each passing day, building a friendship that will withstand financial catastrophe, family tragedy, and devastating heartbreak. The devotion and love they share will help them weather the vagaries of time and enrich their lives as circumstances change, their children grow up and leave home, and their twilight years approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bursting with the intoxicating richness of Dorothea Benton Frank’s beloved Lowcountry—the sultry sunshine, cool ocean breezes, icy cocktails, and starry velvet skies—&lt;i&gt;Same Beach, Next Year&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling celebration of the infrangible power of friendship, the enduring promise of summer, and the indelible bonds of love.</description>

  <description>Kristin Burns has lived her life by the philosophy "Don't think, just shoot"--pictures, that is. Struggling to make ends meet, she works full-time as the nanny for the fabulously wealthy Turnbull family, looking after their two wonderful children and waiting for her glamorous life as a New York photographer to begin. When her photographs are considered by an elite Manhattan art gallery, it seems she might finally get the chance that will start her career.&lt;p&gt;But Kristin has a major distraction: forbidden love. The man of her dreams is almost hers for keeps. Breathless with an inexhaustible passion and the excitement of being within reach of her goals, Kristen ignores all signs of catastrophe brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear exists for a reason. And Kristin can only dismiss the warnings for so long. Searching desperately for the truth through the lens of her camera, she can only hope that it's not too late. This novel of psychological suspense is a stunning achievement for thriller master James Patterson, "one of the bestselling writers in history" &lt;i&gt;New York Sun&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was not my favorite Patterson. Many of his books occur somewhat in the head of the main character. That is normal and makes a book interesting. But this one took place so much in her head, I still don't know what actually happened. Maybe that is what Patterson wanted. But, this one was prett...]]>

  <description>It is the summer of 1950–and at the once-grand mansion of Buckshaw, young Flavia de Luce, an aspiring chemist with a passion for poison, is intrigued by a series of inexplicable events: A dead bird is found on the doorstep, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak. Then, hours later, Flavia finds a man lying in the cucumber patch and watches him as he takes his dying breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Flavia, who is both appalled and delighted, life begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw. “I wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasn’t. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;St. Peter's Square, Rome. White smoke signals that a new Pope has been chosen. Is it possible that the new Pope...is a woman?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world is watching as historic crowds gather in Rome, waiting for news of a new Pope, one who promises to be unlike any other in the Church's history. Some followers are ecstatic, but the leading candidate has made a legion of powerful enemies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a difficult childhood with drug addled parents, to a career as a doctor on the front lines in Sudan, to a series of trials that test her faith at every turn, Brigid Fitzgerald's convictions and callings have made her the target of all those who fear that the Church has lost its way--dangerous adversaries who abhor challenges to tradition. Locked in a deadly, high-stakes battle with forces determined to undermine everything she believes in, Brigid must convert her enemies to her cause before she loses her faith...and her life.</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow - what a book!! I love that Patterson is thinking outside the box here - and millions will read this book and think. Could it happen? Why not? Could we have a woman Pope? And there was so much background about our main character - Brigid. She didn't have an easy life - she truly worked and ca...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An emotionally stirring novel that shows how obstacles can be overcome, differences can be strengths, and sometimes a choice can seem wrong even though it s absolutely right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for her loving but controlling parents, Beth Prudhomme might never have taken charge of her life and moved from her native Chicago to Portland, Oregon, where she s reconnected with her spirited Aunt Sunshine and found a job as a high school music teacher. If not for her friend Nichole, Beth would never have met Sam Carney, although first impressions have left Beth with serious doubts. Sam is everything Beth is not and her parents worst nightmare: a tattooed auto mechanic who s rough around the edges. Reserved and smart as a whip, Beth isn t exactly Sam s usual beer-drinking, pool-playing type of woman, either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if not for an awkward setup one evening, Beth might never have left early and been involved in a car crash. And if not for Sam who witnessed the terrifying ordeal, rushed to her aid, and stayed with her until help arrived Beth might have been all alone, or worse. Yet as events play out, Sam feels compelled to check on Beth almost daily at the hospital even bringing his guitar to play songs to lift her spirits. Soon their unlikely friendship evolves into an intense attraction that surprises them both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Beth's strong-willed mother, Ellie, blows into town spouting harsh opinions, especially about Sam, and reopening old wounds with Sunshine. When shocking secrets from Sam s past are revealed, Beth struggles to reconcile her feelings. But when Beth goes a step too far, she risks losing the man and the life she s come to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Faith, I tell them, is a mystery, elusive to many, and never easy to explain.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping and lyrical, spellbinding and unforgettable, David Ebershoff’s &lt;i&gt;The 19th Wife &lt;/i&gt;combines epic historical fiction with a modern murder mystery to create a brilliant novel of literary suspense. It is 1875, and Ann Eliza Young has recently separated from her powerful husband, Brigham Young, prophet and leader of the Mormon Church. Expelled and an outcast, Ann Eliza embarks on a crusade to end polygamy in the United States. A rich account of a family’s polygamous history is revealed, including how a young woman became a plural wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after Ann Eliza’s story begins, a second exquisite narrative unfolds–a tale of murder involving a polygamist family in present-day Utah. Jordan Scott, a young man who was thrown out of his fundamentalist sect years earlier, must reenter the world that cast him aside in order to discover the truth behind his father’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Ann Eliza’s narrative intertwines with that of Jordan’s search, readers are pulled deeper into the mysteries of love and faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime New York Times bestseller about one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: penguinrandomhouse.ca</description>

  <description>From W. Bruce Cameron, the author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;A Dog's Purpose&lt;/i&gt;, which is now a major motion picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Ray is shocked when an adorable puppy jumps out of an abandoned building and into his arms. Though the apartment he shares with his mother, a disabled veteran, doesn't allow dogs, Lucas can't resist taking Bella home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella is inexplicably drawn to Lucas, even if she doesn't understand the necessity of games like No Barks. As it becomes more difficult to hide her from the neighbors, Lucas begins to sneak Bella into the VA where he works. There, Bella brings joy and comfort where it is needed most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Bella is picked up by Animal Control because pit bulls are banned in Denver, Lucas has no choice but to send her to a foster home until he can figure out what to do. But Bella, distraught at the separation, doesn't plan to wait. With four hundred miles of dangerous Colorado wilderness between her and her person, Bella sets off on a seemingly impossible and completely unforgettable adventure home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A classic story of unwavering loyalty and incredible devotion, &lt;i&gt;A Dog's Way Home&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully told, charming tale that explores the unbreakable bond between us and our pets. This fantastic and exhilarating journey of the heart is in the same tradition as the beloved bestseller, &lt;i&gt;A Dog's Purpose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Dog's Purpose Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1&lt;i&gt; A Dog's Purpose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2&lt;i&gt; A Dog's Journey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other A Dog's Purpose Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ellie's Story: A Dog's Purpose Novel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bailey's Story: A Dog's Purpose Novel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molly's Story: A Dog's Purpose Novel &lt;/i&gt;(forthcoming) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rudy McCann Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Midnight Plan of the Repo Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Repo Madness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Dog's Way Home (forthcoming)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dog Master&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dogs of Christmas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emory's Gift&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Bruce Cameron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every dog has work to do. Every dog has a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bailey meets eight-year-old Ethan, he quickly figures out his purpose: to play with the boy, to explore the Farm during summers with the boy, and to tidy the boy's dishes by licking them clean (only when Mom isn't watching). But Bailey soon learns that life isn't always so simple--that sometimes bad things happen--and that there can be no greater purpose than to protect the boy he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bailey's Story &lt;/i&gt;is a moving tale about a dog and his boy for young animal lovers by W. Bruce Cameron, bestselling author of the acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;A Dog's Purpose&lt;/i&gt;. Adorable black-and-white illustrations by Richard Cowdrey bring Bailey and his world to life. A discussion and activity guide at the end of the book will help promote family and classroom discussions about &lt;i&gt;Bailey's Story &lt;/i&gt;and the insights it provides about humankind's best friends.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these "shining girls" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, &lt;em&gt;The Radium Girls&lt;/em&gt; fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the "wonder" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A luminous debut with unexpected twists, &lt;i&gt;Everything We Keep&lt;/i&gt; explores the devastation of loss, the euphoria of finding love again, and the pulse-racing repercussions of discovering the truth about the ones we hold dear and the lengths they will go to protect us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sous chef Aimee Tierney has the perfect recipe for the perfect life: marry her childhood sweetheart, raise a family, and buy out her parents’ restaurant. But when her fiancé, James Donato, vanishes in a boating accident, her well-baked future is swept out to sea. Instead of walking down the aisle on their wedding day, Aimee is at James’s funeral—a funeral that leaves her more unsettled than at peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aimee struggles to reconstruct her life, she delves deeper into James’s disappearance. What she uncovers is an ocean of secrets that make her question everything about the life they built together. And just below the surface is a truth that may set Aimee free…or shatter her forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lara Jean is having &lt;i&gt;the best&lt;/i&gt; senior year.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there’s still so much to look forward to: a class trip to New York City, prom with her boyfriend Peter, Beach Week after graduation, and her dad’s wedding to Ms. Rothschild. Then she’ll be off to college with Peter, at a school close enough for her to come home and bake chocolate chip cookies on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be more perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what Lara Jean thinks . . . until she gets some unexpected news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the girl who dreads change must rethink all her plans—but when your heart and your head are saying two different things, which one should you listen to?</description>

  <description>A handsome stranger moves to the small Pennsylvania town of Central Valley, and his name is Chris Brennan. He’s applying for a job as a teacher and varsity baseball coach at the local high school, and he looks perfect, on paper. But his name is an alias, his resume is false, and everything about him is a lie. And he has a secret plan - for which he needs a pawn on the baseball team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Sematov loves her younger son Raz, the quirky and free-spirited pitcher of the team. But Raz’s adored father died only a few months ago, and the family is grief-stricken. Secretly, Raz is looking to fill the Daddy-shaped hole in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather Larkin is a struggling single mother who’s dedicated to her only son Justin, the quiet rookie on the team. But Justin’s shy and reserved nature renders him vulnerable to attention, including that of a new father-figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mindy Kostis is the wife of a busy surgeon and the queen bee of the baseball boosters, where her super-popular son Evan is the star catcher. But she doesn’t realize that Evan’s sense of entitlement is becoming a full-blown case of affluenza, and after he gets his new BMW, it’s impossible to know where he’s going – or whom he’s spending time with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lives of these families revolve around the baseball team – and Chris Brennan. What does he really want? How far will he go to get it? Who among them will survive the lethal jeopardy threatening them, from the shadows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enthralling and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;One Perfect Lie&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional thriller and a suburban crime story that will keep readers riveted to the shocking end, with killer twists and characters you won’t soon forget.</description>

But when her husband dies, Jessie fears the family she's longed for is slipping away - until Chase Logan unexpectedly comes to her rescue. By pretending to be her husband, Chase can make all of her dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days are all she asks of him. Three days to ignite a love neither of them ever imagined possible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number of Pages: 283</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An Absent Mind&lt;/i&gt;, a riveting new novel from Eric Rill, author of &lt;i&gt;Pinnacle of Deceit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Innocent Traitor&lt;/i&gt;, is about a race against time. The ticking time bomb is Saul Reimer's sanity. His Alzheimer's is going to be the catalyst that will either bring his family together or tear it apart. Although &lt;i&gt;An Absent Mind&lt;/i&gt; depicts Saul's arduous struggle with Alzheimer's, it is equally a story about his relationship with his loved ones and their shared journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventy-one, and a man used to controlling those around him, Saul finds himself helplessly slipping into the abyss in what he describes as his slow dance with death. As we listen in on his ramblings, humor, emotions, lucid moments, and confusion, we are also privy to the thoughts and feelings his family share with us-his wife, Monique, conflicted and depressed; caring, yet angry; his daughter, Florence, compassionate, worried about her father's health, yet proper and reserved; his son, Joey, self-centered and narcissistic, seemingly distant from his family's challenges. And Dr. Tremblay, Saul's Alzheimer's specialist, who provides the reader with facts and observations about this dreaded disease that imprisons more than 35 million people worldwide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know from the beginning how it has to end for Saul, because no one has ever outsmarted Alzheimer's. But how will he navigate the meandering road that will eventually destroy his health and result in his death? And how will it affect those around him as they live with strain and guilt, while at the same time being forced to face their own demons? These questions are answered expertly by the author as he explores the conflicts that rise to the surface as the family deals with Saul's dementia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Rill's novel is reminiscent of Lisa Genova's &lt;i&gt;Still Alice, Nicholas Sparks &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt;, and Alice Munro's &lt;i&gt;Away From Her&lt;/i&gt;. Although a beautiful work of literary fiction, &lt;i&gt;An Absent Mind&lt;/i&gt; will expose the reader to the reality of Alzheimer's.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I saw this book about Alzheimer's and decided to read it. Not sure why but I have a fear that this will be me. What a sad way that would be to go. Good book. Narrators did well. The story was dry but I still learned more about what it would be like. My heart goes out to people suffering from this...]]>

  <description>Fifteen months ago, Detective Lindsay Boxer's life was perfect--she had a beautiful child and a doting husband, Joe, who helped her catch a criminal who'd brazenly detonated a bomb in downtown San Francisco, killing twenty-five people. But Joe wasn't everything that Lindsay thought he was, and she's still reeling from his betrayal as a wave of mysterious, and possibly unnatural, heart attacks claims seemingly unrelated victims across San Francisco. As if that weren't enough, the bomber she and Joe captured is about to go on trial, and his defense raises damning questions about Lindsay and Joe's investigation. Not knowing whom to trust, and struggling to accept the truth about the man she thought she knew, Lindsay must connect the dots of a deadly conspiracy before a brilliant criminal puts her on trial.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You can take Michael Bennett out of New York City, but you can't take the cop out of Michael Bennett.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Michael Bennett is ready for a vacation after a series of crises push him, and his family, to the brink. He settles on an idyllic, small town in the beautiful Maine woods, a recommendation from a former colleague. But just when Bennett thinks he can relax, he gets pulled into a case that has shocked the tight-knit community. Kids are disappearing left and right with no explanation-until several bodies turn up in the woods. As Bennett investigates, he discovers that the seemingly perfect town is reeling from a deadly addiction, and the violence is about to reach a fever pitch. Far from the city streets he knows so well, Bennett faces off against a horrific evil next door that threatens a town, the law, and the family that Bennett loves above all else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was probably one of my favorite in the Michael Bennett series because it focuses on his family. I love hearing about Shamus, Mary Catherine, and all 10 of those kids. I love how this one turned out but I am sad about Brian. I won't explain that further so I don't spoil that part of the story...]]>

  <description>A historian of fascism offers a guide for surviving and resisting America’s turn towards authoritarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 9th, millions of Americans woke up to the impossible: the election of Donald Trump as president. Against all predictions, one of the most-disliked presidential candidates in history had swept the electoral college, elevating a man with open contempt for democratic norms and institutions to the height of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timothy Snyder is one of the most celebrated historians of the Holocaust. In his books &lt;i&gt;Bloodlands&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Black Earth&lt;/i&gt;, he has carefully dissected the events and values that enabled the rise of Hitler and Stalin and the execution of their catastrophic policies. With &lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, Snyder draws from the darkest hours of the twentieth century to provide hope for the twenty-first. As he writes, “Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism and communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt; is a call to arms and a guide to resistance, with invaluable ideas for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come.</description>

  <description>Lisa and Francesca are back with another collection of warm and witty stories that will strike a chord with every woman. This six book series is among the best reviewed humor books published today and has been compared to the late greats, Erma Bombeck and Nora Ephron. Delia Ephron said of the fifth book in the series, &lt;i&gt;Have a Nice Guilt Trip&lt;/i&gt;, "Lisa and Francesca, mother and daughter, bring you the laughter of their lives once again and better than ever. You will identify with these tales of guilt and fall in love with them and fierce (grand) Mother Mary." This seventh volume will not disappoint as it hits the humorous and poignant note that fans have come to expect from the beloved mother-daughter duo.</description>

  <description>When the body of troubled teenager Elodie Duncan is pulled from the river in Abbeyford, the case is at first assumed to be a straightforward suicide. Detective Sergeant Kate Redman is shocked to discover that she’d met the victim the night before her death, introduced by Kate’s younger brother Jay. As the case develops, it becomes clear that Elodie was murdered. A talented young musician, Elodie had been keeping some strange company and was hiding her own dark secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the list of suspects begin to grow, so do the questions. What is the significance of the painting Elodie modelled for? Who is the man who was seen with her on the night of her death? Is there any connection with another student’s death at the exclusive musical college that Elodie attended?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kate and her partner Detective Sergeant Mark Olbeck attempt to unravel the mystery, the dark undercurrents of the case threaten those whom Kate holds most dear…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requiem (A Kate Redman mystery) is the new novel from crime writer Celina Grace, author of Hushabye (A Kate Redman Mystery), Lost Girls and The House on Fever Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for The Kate Redman Mysteries from Amazon and Goodreads reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“One of the best I have read this year. I read about a fourth of the book early in the day, then at bedtime, I thought I would read a bit more before sleep. I finished the book at 5:20 AM. Just could not put it down.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“At last, a mystery that delivers…I found this novel superb because I got all I needed to know and none of what I didn’t.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“…a gripping detective story but the main character engages you, and as well as wanting to know how the mystery turns out you want to learn more about her too.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“…amazing book, read it front to back in one visit, couldn`t help myself…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“…the most enjoyable Kindle book I have so far read since the 'low cost electronic revolution' which has been sweeping my reading habits for the last couple of years! Thoroughly recommended.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This was my introduction to the author, and I'm so glad I discovered the book. Well-written and a real page turner.”</description>

  <description>When Sara Hardy inherits a cottage in the small town of Redemption, Connecticut, it is just the break she needs to draw a line under her past—to begin again, on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara never thought she’d be starting over. She was married, successful, and the mother of a beautiful girl. But the life she thought was on the right path has taken a series of wrong turns…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Jake Mathieson has a lot on his plate. Still reeling from a tragedy for which he feels responsible, he finds himself unexpectedly caring for his six-year-old nephew. In desperation, he comes to Redemption to enlist the help of his Aunt Cilla, a widow with demons of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake is intrigued by Cilla’s cautious new neighbor. Like him, Sara is desperate to put the past behind her but not quite sure how to begin. Can Redemption offer either of them a second chance to find hope and happiness—perhaps even to take a risk on new love?</description>

  <description>Waking Up White is the book Irving wishes someone had handed her decades ago. By sharing her sometimes cringe-worthy struggle to understand racism and racial tensions, she offers a fresh perspective on bias, stereotypes, manners, and tolerance. As Irving unpacks her own long-held beliefs about colorblindness, being a good person, and wanting to help people of color, she reveals how each of these well-intentioned mindsets actually perpetuated her ill-conceived ideas about race. She also explains why and how she's changed the way she talks about racism, works in racially mixed groups, and understands the antiracism movement as a whole. Exercises at the end of each chapter prompt readers to explore their own racialized ideas. Waking Up White's personal narrative is designed to work well as a rapid read, a book group book, or support reading for courses exploring racial and cultural issues.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>Set in the early 1970s against the specter of the Manson girls, when the peace and love movement begins to turn ugly, this is the story of a runaway teenager's disappearance and her sister's quest to discover the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline Leavitt is at her mesmerizing best in this haunting, nuanced portrait of love, sisters, and the impossible legacy of family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1969, and sixteen-year-old Lucy is about to run away with a much older man to live off the grid in rural Pennsylvania, a rash act that will have vicious repercussions for both her and her older sister, Charlotte. As Lucy's default caretaker for most of their lives, Charlotte's youth has been marked by the burden of responsibility, but never more so than when Lucy's dream of a rural paradise turns into nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gorgeous prose and indelible characters, Cruel Beautiful World examines the intricate, infinitesimal distance between seduction and love, loyalty and duty, and what happens when you're responsible for things you can't fix.</description>

  <description>Marty and Clem set out for the pioneer West full of hopes and dreams. They would stake a claim of their own on the new frontier, and build a home for themselves and their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just after they'd arrived and Clem had chosen the perfect setting for their new home, an accident took his life...leaving Marty alone and pregnant. Then, on the day of his funeral, Clark Davis came along...and asked Marty to marry him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty was infuriated -- but with no money, no shelter, and a baby on the way, what choice did she have? Besides, Clark said he only wanted her to be a mama to his baby girl, Missie. If Marty was still unhappy come spring, he would pay for her ticket back East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined not to be a burden to Clark, and intending only to earn her keep. Marty threw herself into her new role of "Mama." But she had never been anyone's mama before, and she didn't even know how to keep a house! If only she could do right by this lonely man and his daughter just long enough to earn her train fare back home...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Marty must learn wholeness and love through patience and faith</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;For fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent &lt;br /&gt;comes a story like no other... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A toxic river divides nineteen-year-old Violet Bates's world by gender. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women rule the East. Men rule the West. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the lands of Matrus and Patrus. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the disappearance of her beloved younger brother, Violet's life has been consumed by an anger she struggles to control. Already a prisoner to her own nation, now she has been sentenced to death for her crimes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But one decision could save her life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enter the kingdom of Patrus, where men rule and women submit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about the patriarchy is dangerous for a rebellious girl like Violet. She cannot break the rules if she wishes to stay alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But abiding by rules has never been Violet's strong suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she's thrust into more danger than she could have ever predicted, Violet is forced to sacrifice many things in the forbidden kingdom ... including forbidden love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a world divided by gender, only the strongest survive...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 18 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone - 999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.&lt;br /&gt;Tony Valdez is a Dispatcher - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to humanely dispatch those whose circumstances put them in death's crosshairs, so they can have a second chance to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow Dispatcher and former friend is apparently kidnapped, Tony learns that there are some things that are worse than death and that some people are ready to do almost anything to avenge a supposed wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It's a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before not even a Dispatcher can save him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___&lt;br /&gt;Zachary Quinto - best known for his role as the Nimoy-approved Spock in the recent Star Trek reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer, Sylar, in Heroes - brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to this audio-exclusive novella from master storyteller John Scalzi.</description>

  <description>Scottoline writes riveting thrillers that keep me up all night, with plots that twist and turn. Harlan Coben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One boy. One lawyer. One chance for justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten-year-old Patrick O'Brien is a natural target at school. Shy, dyslexic, and small for his age, he tries to hide his first-grade reading level from everyone: from his classmates, from the grandfather who cares for him, and from the teachers who are supposed to help him. But the real trouble begins when Patrick is accused of attacking a school aide. The aide promptly quits and sues the boy, his family, and the school district. Patrick's grandfather turns to the law firm of Rosato &amp;amp; DiNunzio for help and Mary DiNunzio is on the case. Soon Mary becomes Patrick's true champion and his only hope for security and justice. But there is more to the story than meets the eye and Patrick might be more troubled than he seems. With twists at every turn and secrets about the family coming to light, Mary DiNunzio might have found the case that can make her a true protector, or break her heart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Lisa Scottoline s trademark emotional depth and fast-paced action, "Damaged" will have readers riveted to the last page as they root for the beloved characters and their fight for justice."</description>

  <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--jacket description</description>

  <description>Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>Originally appeared in the print anthology &lt;em&gt;The Bite Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat and Bones were looking forward to a normal holiday – at least as “normal” as it gets for vampires and their otherworldly friends and family. But their yuletide plans are shattered when a mysterious stranger shows up and reveals long-buried secrets that threaten to take a bite out of their holiday cheer – and lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From #1 &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; best-selling author Sandra Brown comes a heart-pounding story of survival, that takes the age-old question, "Does the end justify the means?" and turns it on its head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Emory Charbonneau, a pediatrician and marathon runner, disappears on a mountain road in North Carolina. By the time her husband Jeff, miffed over a recent argument, reports her missing, the trail has grown cold. Literally. Fog and ice encapsulate the mountainous wilderness and paralyze the search for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While police suspect Jeff of "instant divorce," Emory, suffering from an unexplained head injury, regains consciousness and finds herself the captive of a man whose violent past is so dark that he won't even tell her his name. She's determined to escape him, and willing to take any risks necessary to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpectedly, however, the two have a dangerous encounter with people who adhere to a code of justice all their own. At the center of the dispute is a desperate young woman whom Emory can't turn her back on, even if it means breaking the law. Wrong becomes right at the hands of the man who strikes fear, but also sparks passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her husband's deception is revealed, and the FBI closes in on her captor, Emory begins to wonder if the man with no name is, in fact, her rescuer from those who wish her dead - and from heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining the nail-biting suspense and potent storytelling that has made Sandra Brown one of the world's best loved authors, MEAN STREAK is a wildly compelling novel about love, deceit, and the choices we must make in order to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will the last humans on Earth please turn out the lights?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Patterson's ZOO was just the beginning. The planet is still under violent siege by ferocious animals. Humans are their desperate prey. Except some humans are evolving, mutating into a savage species that could save civilization-or end it.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Caught in the crossfire of a deadly standoff, Detective Michael Bennett must kill...or be killed. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tensions between America and Russia are the highest they've been since the Cold War. As the countries' Presidents travel to the United Nations to iron out their differences, a fashionable husband and wife team of lethal assassins prowls the streets of Manhattan hunting their prey--a professor hiding a scandalous secret. Their next target: the extremely popular President of the United States of America.&lt;p&gt;Pulled away from his family and pressed into service, Detective Michael Bennett must trace the source of a threat that could rip the country apart--and what he finds may turn the Cold War red hot once again. With allegiances constantly in doubt and no one above suspicion, only Bennett can step into the line of fire to save the President before the deadly kill shot hits its mark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In love we find out who we want to be. In war we find out who we are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France, 1939&lt;br /&gt;In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When France is overrun, Vianne is forced to take an enemy into her house, and suddenly her every move is watched; her life and her child’s life is at constant risk. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates around her, she must make one terrible choice after another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets the compelling and mysterious Gäetan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. When he betrays her, Isabelle races headlong into danger and joins the Resistance, never looking back or giving a thought to the real--and deadly--consequences.</description>

  <description>Getting drunk homecoming night your senior year is never a good idea, but Jake Hayes never expected it all to end with a car crash and a t-post embedded in his throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His biggest regret about it all? What he never said to Samantha Shay. He's been in love with her for years and never had the guts to tell her. Now it's too late. Because after that night, Jake will never be able to talk again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jake returns to his small island home, population 5,000, he'll have to learn how to deal with being mute. He also finds that his family isn't limited to his six brothers and sisters, that sometimes an entire island is watching out for you. And when he gets the chance to spend more time with Samantha, she'll help him learn that not being able to talk isn’t the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Maybe, if she'll let him, Jake will finally tell her what he didn't say before, even if he can't actually say it.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An emotional, heartwarming story from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Elin Hilderbrand about a grieving family that finds solace where they least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrity chef Deacon Thorpe has always been a force of nature with an insatiable appetite for life. But after that appetite contributes to Deacon's shocking death in his favorite place on earth, a ramshackle Nantucket summer cottage, his (messy, complicated) family is reeling. Now Deacon's three wives, his children, and his best friend gather on the island he loved to say farewell. The three very different women have long been bitter rivals, each wanting to claim the primary place in Deacon's life and his heart. But as they slowly let go of the resentments they've held onto for years and remember the good times, secrets are revealed, confidences are shared, and improbable bonds are formed as this unlikely family says goodbye to the man who brought them all together, for better or worse--and the women he loved find new ways to love again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Luke,&lt;br /&gt;First let me say—I love you... I didn’t want to leave you... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Richardson has returned home after burying Natalie, his beloved wife of sixteen years, ready to face the hard job of raising their three children alone. But there’s something he’s not prepared for—a blue envelope with his name scrawled across the front in Natalie’s handwriting, waiting for him on the floor of their suburban Michigan home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter inside, written on the first day of Natalie’s cancer treatment a year ago, turns out to be the first of many. Luke is convinced they’re genuine, but who is delivering them? As his obsession with the letters grows, Luke uncovers long-buried secrets that make him question everything he knew about his wife and their family. But the revelations also point the way toward a future where love goes on—in written words, in memories, and in the promises it’s never too late to keep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Mickey Haller gets the text, "Call me ASAP - 187," and the California penal code for murder immediately gets his attention. Murder cases have the highest stakes and the biggest paydays, and they always mean Haller has to be at the top of his game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one. He soon finds out that she was back in LA and back in the life. Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt.</description>

  <description>Since the death of her newborn baby, lawyer-turned-stay-at-home mom Sarah Shaw has been struggling to keep it together for her law professor husband and two young sons. With her husband burying himself in his career and her friendships all having withered, she is lost in a private world of grief. Then one day, walking in LA, Sarah s heart catches at the sight of a young homeless woman pushing a baby in a stroller and saving them becomes her mission. An unlikely bond grows between Sarah and the mother, Josie, whose pride and strained relationship with her own mother prevent her from going home to Oakland. Through her friendship with Josie, Sarah slowly learns that those we love are never far, even in death and that sometimes it is the people we set out to save who save us. &lt;i&gt;Shelter Us&lt;/i&gt; speaks to the quiet joys and anxieties of parenthood, and illuminates the place all parents know: that shadowy space between unconditional love and fear of unbearable loss.</description>

  <description>A preacher is found brutally murdered in a Tennessee motel room. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A beautiful, mysterious young girl is accused. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this Mystery Readers International finalist for "Best Debut Mystery," criminal defense lawyer Joe Dillard has become jaded over the years as he's tried to balance his career against his conscience. Savvy but cynical, Dillard wants to quit doing criminal defense, but he can't resist the chance to represent someone who might actually be innocent. His drug-addicted sister has just been released from prison and his mother is succumbing to Alzheimer's, but Dillard's commitment to the case never wavers despite the personal troubles and professional demands that threaten to destroy him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Pratt's richly developed characters are vivid and believable, especially the strong Southern women who fight their male-dominated culture from behind a facade of vulnerability in this brilliantly executed debut." -- Publisher's Weekly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"It’s Scott Turow and Grisham... The opening chapter is maybe the most compelling I’ve read in a decade.” – Ken Bruen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smart and sophisticated, with a plot twist that will leave you shaking your head in wonder, "An Innocent Client" -- the first in the acclaimed Joe Dillard series -- will also leave you wanting more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Space is a brutal home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three hundred years ago, the Earth died, and the last humans fled. Beaten. Broken in more ways than one. Their descendants carry the Legacy Code—mangled genes that force them to abort half their unborn children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Era and Dritan Corinth get placements on the safest ship in the fleet and win a chance to have a child, they feel lucky. Until the day Era's supposed to find out if her baby has the Defect, and the ship suffers a hull breach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An investigation uncovers new threats. Dangerous secrets. Lies. &lt;i&gt;Treason.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Era begins to question everything she’s been taught about the fleet, their search for a new Earth, and the Defect. But the answers she seeks were never meant to be found...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legacy Code is a suspenseful, dark post-apocalyptic read that has earned five star reviews from fans of books like Hunger Games, Divergent, and Red Rising, and has been compared favorably to Wool, 1984, and the new Battlestar Galactica.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>How do you move on after losing the person you loved? How do you build a life worth living?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Louisa Clark is no longer just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life. After the transformative six months spent with Will Traynor, she is struggling without him. When an extraordinary accident forces Lou to return home to her family, she can’t help but feel she’s right back where she started.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her body heals, but Lou herself knows that she needs to be kick-started back to life. Which is how she ends up in a church basement with the members of the Moving On support group, who share insights, laughter, frustrations, and terrible cookies. They will also lead her to the strong, capable Sam Fielding—the paramedic, whose business is life and death, and the one man who might be able to understand her. Then a figure from Will’s past appears and hijacks all her plans, propelling her into a very different future. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Lou Clark, life after Will Traynor means learning to fall in love again, with all the risks that brings. But here Jojo Moyes gives us two families, as real as our own, whose joys and sorrows will touch you deeply, and where both changes and surprises await.</description>
