  <description>Maggie Shipstead’s Seating Arrangements is a stunning debut, an irresistible social satire that is also an unforgettable meditation on the persistence of hope, the yearning for connection, and the promise of enduring love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winn Van Meter is heading for his family’s retreat on the pristine New England island of Waskeke. Normally a haven of calm, for the next three days this sanctuary will be overrun by tipsy revelers as Winn prepares for the marriage of his daughter Daphne to the affable young scion Greyson Duff. Winn’s wife, Biddy, has planned the wedding with military precision, but arrangements are sideswept by a storm of salacious misbehavior and intractable lust: Daphne’s sister, Livia, who has recently had her heart broken by Teddy Fenn, the son of her father’s oldest rival, is an eager target for the seductive wiles of Greyson’s best man; Winn, instead of reveling in his patriarchal duties, is tormented by his long-standing crush on Daphne’s beguiling bridesmaid Agatha; and the bride and groom find themselves presiding over a spectacle of misplaced desire, marital infidelity, and monumental loss of faith in the rituals of American life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, keenly intelligent, and commandingly well written, Shipstead’s deceptively frothy first novel is a piercing rumination on desire, on love and its obligations, and on the dangers of leading an inauthentic life, heralding the debut of an exciting new literary voice.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil's name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does or does not say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition include an appendix entitled "Names Have Power," detailing the reasons Thomas chose to name different characters and places throughout the book. It also features an excerpt from her upcoming book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068618-on-the-come-up?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true" rel="nofollow"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; as well as art inspired by &lt;i&gt;The Hate U Give&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>What does “feminism” mean today? That is the question at the heart of &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt;, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Half of a Yellow Sun&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.</description>

  <description>Mrs. Dalloway chronicles a June day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway–a day that is taken up with running minor errands in preparation for a party and that is punctuated, toward the end, by the suicide of a young man she has never met. In giving an apparently ordinary day such immense resonance and significance–infusing it with the elemental conflict between death and life–Virginia Woolf triumphantly discovers her distinctive style as a novelist. Originally published in 1925, &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Dalloway &lt;/i&gt;is Woolf’s first complete rendering of what she described as the “luminous envelope” of consciousness: a dazzling display of the mind’s inside as it plays over the brilliant surface and darker depths of reality.</description>

  <description>This guide for parents is a complete introduction to autism and anxiety. Drawing on the author's clinical experience working with children and their families, it provides parents and carers with everything they need to know to help support their child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covers the basics such as what anxiety is, how it manifests behaviourally and why it is common in autism, before presenting practical strategies for managing a common range of anxieties: separation, social, performance, phobias, and generalised anxiety. It also has chapters dedicated to related behaviours including Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) and advice and on managing meltdowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear, concise and practical guide that answers any questions that parents and carers might have about anxiety and provides support strategies to help children with autism manage a range of anxieties.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover an eye-opening and provocative new way to look at our health based on the latest groundbreaking discoveries in the science of compassion, kindness, and human connection. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of its rigor and science, medicine is full of stories—mysteries—that doctors and research cannot explain. Patients who are biologically healthy, but feel ill. Patients who are biologically ill, but feel healthy. What if these health mysteries could teach us something about what really makes us sick—and how to be healthy?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Columbia University doctor Kelli Harding began her clinical practice, she never intended to explore the invisible factors behind our health. But then there were the rabbits. In 1978, a seemingly straightforward experiment designed to establish the relationship between high blood cholesterol and heart health in rabbits discovered that kindness—in the form of a particularly nurturing post-doc who pet and spoke to the lab rabbits as she fed them—made the difference between a heart attack and a healthy heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As Dr. Kelli Harding reveals in this eye-opening book, the rabbits were just the beginning of a much larger story. Groundbreaking new research shows that love, friendship, community, life’s purpose, and our environment can have a greater impact on our health than anything that happens in the doctor’s office. For instance, chronic loneliness can be as unhealthy as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day; napping regularly can decrease one’s risk of heart disease; and people with purpose are less likely to get sick. Through provocative storytelling and compelling research, Harding presents a new model for you to take charge of your health.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At once paradigm-shifting and empowering, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;he Rabbit Effect&lt;/i&gt; shares a radical new way to think about health, wellness, and how we live.</description>

  <description>What would life be like if something had prevented Jane Austen from ever publishing any of her books? Dedicated Janeite, Rose, is about to find out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s September, and the city of Bath is playing host to the annual Jane Austen Festival, a celebration of the famous author and her works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Wallace, Bath resident and avid Jane Austen fan, can’t wait for her friends to arrive and the Festival to start, unaware one of the recently arrived guests will turn her life upside down by sharing with her a secret that ultimately puts Jane Austen’s entire literary legacy at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the support of a displaced two hundred year old author and a charmed necklace, can Rose help to bring back some of the most beloved stories of all time and turn her own life around in the process?</description>

  <description>A 25th anniversary history and celebration of The Shawshank Redemption, one of the most cherished American films of the late twentieth century and one of the finest movies made from a Stephen King story. The movie not only boasts a great story, it has a great backstory, starting with the dollar deal that eventually led King and co-stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to put their trust in a largely untested director making his first feature film. Although the film received mostly positive reviews on its release in September 1994, the box office was disappointing and it failed to win many awards. But as Andy tells Red in the film, "no good thing ever dies." The movie found new life, reaching an ever-growing audience on cable and home video (through word of mouth, it became one of the top-rented movies of 1995). Each year, The Shawshank Redemption rises in polls asking film fans to name their favorite movies. It has become nothing less than this generation's The Grapes of Wrath, an inspiring story about keeping hope alive in bleak times and under the most horrendous conditions.</description>

  <description>Synchronicity: the phenomenon of experiencing a striking and meaningful coincidence that connects our inner and outer worlds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synchronicity can act as a guide along our life path, helping us through challenging times, restoring self-belief and awakening a deeper understanding of ourselves and our destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing for both practitioners and anyone interested in mental health, wellbeing and the opportunities offered by altered states of consciousness, psychologist Chris Mackey provides astounding case studies and many practical suggestions for working with synchronicity, from journaling and symbol analysis to dream interpretation and ideas for accessing flow. He makes a passionate case that acknowledging synchronicity, as well as other forms of transcendent experience, plays an important role in positive psychology - the science of wellbeing - enabling us to thrive and find fulfilment in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Mackey is a clinical psychologist with 40 years' experience.</description>

  <description>For Dr. Guy Leschziner's patients, there is no rest for the weary in mind and body. Insomnia, narcolepsy, night terrors, sleep apnea, and sleepwalking are just a sampling of conditions afflicting sufferers who cannot sleep--and their experiences in trying are the stuff of nightmares. Demoniac hallucinations frighten people into paralysis. Restless legs rock both the sleepless and their sleeping partners with unpredictable and uncontrollable kicking. Out-of-sync circadian rhythms confuse the natural body clock's days and nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are the extreme cases. A woman in a state of deep sleep who gets dressed, unlocks her car, and drives for several miles before returning to bed. The man who has spent decades cleaning out kitchens while "sleep-eating." The teenager prone to the serious, yet unfortunately nicknamed "Sleeping Beauty Syndrome" stuck in a cycle of excessive unconsciousness, binge eating, and uncharacteristic displays of aggression and hyper-sexuality while awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With compassionate stories of his patients and their conditions, Dr. Leschziner illustrates the neuroscience behind our sleeping minds, revealing the many biological and psychological factors necessary in getting the rest that will not only maintain our physical and mental health, but improve our cognitive abilities and overall happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Pure and lovely…to read Zelda’s letters is to fall in love with her.” —&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Edited by renowned Jackson R. Bryer and Cathy W. Barks, with an introduction by Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald's granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan, this compilation of over three hundred letters tells the couple's epic love story in their own words.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald's devotion to each other endured for more than twenty-two years, through the highs and lows of his literary success and alcoholism, and her mental illness. In &lt;i&gt;Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda&lt;/i&gt;, over 300 of their collected love letters show why theirs has long been heralded as one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Edited by renowned Fitzgerald scholars Jackson R. Bryer and Cathy W. Barks, with an introduction by Scott and Zelda's granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan, this is a welcome addition to the Fitzgerald literary canon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, &lt;em&gt;Girl, Wash Your Face&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to live with passion and hustle--and how to give yourself grace without giving up.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now in a special edition to mark the twentieth anniversary of a beloved cult classic!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Read the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling coming-of-age story that takes a sometimes heartbreaking, often hysterical, and always honest look at high school in all its glory. Also a major motion picture starring Logan Lerman and Emma Watson, &lt;i&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, touching, and haunting modern classic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The critically acclaimed debut novel from Stephen Chbosky follows observant “wallflower” Charlie as he charts a course through the strange world between adolescence and adulthood. First dates, family drama, and new friends. Sex, drugs, and &lt;i&gt;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&lt;/i&gt;. Devastating loss, young love, and life on the fringes. Caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it, Charlie must learn to navigate those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best seller for more than a year, an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults (2000) and Best Book for Reluctant Readers (2000), and with millions of copies in print, this novel for teen readers (or “wallflowers” of more-advanced age) will make you laugh, cry, and perhaps feel nostalgic for those moments when you, too, tiptoed onto the dance floor of life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A clear and effective approach to learning evidence-based DBT skills—now in a fully revised and updated second edition.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have trouble managing your emotions? First developed by Marsha M. Linehan for treating borderline personality disorder, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has proven effective as treatment for a range of other mental health problems, and can greatly improve your ability to handle distress without losing control and acting destructively. However, to make use of these techniques, you need to build skills in four key areas: distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook&lt;/i&gt;, a collaborative effort from three esteemed authors, offers evidence-based, step-by-step exercises for learning these concepts and putting them to work for real and lasting change. Start by working on the introductory exercises and, after making progress, move on to the advanced-skills chapters. Whether you’re a mental health professional or a general reader, you'll benefit from this clear and practical guide to better managing your emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fully revised and updated second edition also includes new chapters on cognitive rehearsal, distress tolerance, and self-compassion. Once you’ve completed the exercises in this book and are ready to move on to the next level, check out the authors’ new book, &lt;i&gt;The New Happiness Workbook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book has been awarded &lt;/i&gt;The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit&lt;i&gt; — an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties. Used alone or in conjunction with therapy, our books offer powerful tools readers can use to jump-start changes in their lives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find more help online at elearning.newharbinger.com.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller: The moving, entertaining, never-before-told story of how one man found his calling: to see that those who defend this country and its freedoms are never forgotten.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The book is called &lt;em&gt;Grateful American&lt;/em&gt;, and I promise you after you read it you will be grateful for what Gary has accomplished and contributed to our country." -- Clint Eastwood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a kid in suburban Chicago, Gary Sinise was more interested in sports and rock 'n' roll than reading or schoolwork. But when he impulsively auditioned for a school production of &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, he found his purpose--or so it seemed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few years Gary and a handful of friends created what became one of the most exciting and important new theater companies in America. From its humble beginnings in a suburban Chicago church basement and eventual move into the city, the Steppenwolf Theatre Company launched a series of groundbreaking productions, igniting Gary's career along with those of John Malkovich, Joan Allen, Gary Cole, Laurie Metcalf, Jeff Perry, John Mahoney, and others. Television and film came calling soon after, and Gary starred in &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; (which he also directed) and &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; before taking the role that would change his life in unforeseeable ways: Lieutenant Dan in the Academy Award–winning &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The military community's embrace of the character of the disabled veteran was matched only by the depth of Gary's realization that America's defenders had not received all the honor, respect, and gratitude their sacrifices deserve. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, this became Gary's mission. While starring in hits like &lt;em&gt;Apollo 13&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ransom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Truman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;George Wallace&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CSI:NY&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders&lt;/em&gt;, Gary has worked tirelessly on behalf of those who serve this country, entertaining more than a half million troops around the world playing bass guitar with his Lt. Dan Band, raising funds on behalf of veterans, and eventually founding the Gary Sinise Foundation with a mission to serve and honor America's defenders, veterans, first responders, their families, and those in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grateful American&lt;/em&gt; is the moving, entertaining, profoundly gripping story of how one man found his calling: to see that those who defend this country and its freedoms are never forgotten.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man’s thrilling journey through an enchanted world to find his wife, who has disappeared after seemingly committing an unforgiveable act of violence, from the award-winning author of the &lt;i&gt;The Devil in Silver&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Machine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollo Kagwa has had strange dreams that have haunted him since childhood. An antiquarian book dealer with a business called Improbabilia, he is just beginning to settle into his new life as a committed and involved father, unlike his own father who abandoned him, when his wife Emma begins acting strange. Disconnected and uninterested in their new baby boy, Emma at first seems to be exhibiting all the signs of post-partum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go far beyond that. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act—beyond any parent’s comprehension—and vanishes, seemingly into thin air. Thus begins Apollo’s odyssey through a world he only thought he understood to find a wife and child who are nothing like he’d imagined. His quest begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma’s whereabouts. Apollo then begins a journey that takes him to a forgotten island in the East River of New York City, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest in Queens where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. This dizzying tale is ultimately a story about family and the unfathomable secrets of the people we love.</description>

  <description>Kay Hutchison had it all: a successful career, a beautiful home, and a loving husband. But her life changed forever one annual holiday, and it started with "I’m leaving." Going solo, Kay embarked on a unique journey of self-discovery. From colonic irrigation to cupping and reiki to reflexology, Kay found herself calling psychics, going to healers and tarot card readers, and dabbling in past-life regression, sonic therapy, silent retreats, astrology, shamanic retreats and much, much more. This book is the funny, moving and occasionally harrowing account of one woman’s search for the truth, from the sunshine of Spain to deep inside the psyche of her Scottish childhood. The result is an unusually candid exploration of both the challenges and opportunities of middle age.</description>

  <description>#MeToo: Essays About How and Why This Happened,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What It Means and How To Make Sure It Never Happens Again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 16 million people had posted their #MeToo story and support against sexual harassment by mid-October as a reaction to Rose McGowan’s brave admission that she had allegedly been raped by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. A groundswell of reaction to and exposure of this sexual predation was unleashed that has spread throughout Europe and beyond. New revelations of unacceptable behavior in every industry break every day as people come forward in response to the viral #MeToo posts. Protests are scheduled such as the “Take back the Workplace” Hollywood march in November of 2017, and legislation is being drafted in New York and California to finally change the way things have been for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the turning point. Things are going to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a historic moment and it needs to be memorialized, passed around and passed on. Although social media is a fantastic means of igniting a fire, it needs to keep burning, like a torch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Riverdale Avenue Books, a woman-owned leading hybrid publisher, is putting its money, words and power, behind this and publishing this collection of 26 essays from people who understand want to make this change, and we, as a society, have got to figure out a way to drive that change forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pass this book around. Share it with your sons, brothers, fathers, your daughters, sisters and mothers, your co-workers and friends. Read passages to them, if they won’t read it for themselves. Leave it on the desk of someone who should know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help us make this movement more than a hashtag.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Imagined by one of the world's foremost JFK scholars, this fictionalised conversation presents the essential biography of America's most glamorous and mythologised president.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many, the presidency of John F. Kennedy was a magic interlude in American history. His admirers saw him as a leader of intelligence and imagination, who wielded power with grace, courage and verve - although detractors have questioned the depth of his convictions and drawn attention to his serial philandering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kennedy's rise also marked the beginning of modern "celebrity" politics - a politician with film star charisma who proved ideally suited to the new age of television. Meet the man himself and he'll tell you how it felt to have his finger on the red button when the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is divided into two parts: a biographical essay that provides a concise overview of JFK's life, achievements, scandals and controversies; and a Q&amp;amp;A dialogue based on rigorous research and incorporating JFK's actual spoken or written words whenever possible, along with rigorously researched biographical interpretations of his various views and positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you will find all the key moments in JFK's life and career: his early days at Harvard and the US Navy; his family background and the importance of his Catholic faith; running for office against Richard Nixon; his clashes with communist power in Berlin and Cuba; the Civil Rights movement; Vietnam; and the president's often scandalous personal life that was carefully concealed from an adoring public. Kennedy's assassination on 22 November 1963 marked the beginning of a tumultuous and bitterly divided decade, and birthed countless conspiracy theories that thrive to this day. These legacies of polarisation and suspicion of established authority have assumed particular salience in the 21st century.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25392545-carry-on" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here -- it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carry On - The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow&lt;/em&gt; is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;"The beautiful new book from Salon bibliotherapist Ella Berthoud&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; ... explores how reading mindfully enhances our lives and asks, if reading is our daily nourishment, how best should it be consumed?" &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;- Damian Barr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The healing power of reading has been renowned since Aristotle; focus, flow and enlightenment can all be discovered through this universal act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art of Mindful Reading &lt;/i&gt;embraces the joy of absorbing words on a page, encouraging a state of mind as deeply therapeutic and vital to our wellbeing as breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bibliotherapist Ella Berthoud asks if reading is our daily nourishment how best should it be consumed? How should you read mindfully? And why will reading mindfully help you to read better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She explores how reading mindfully can shape the person you are, give you your moral backbone, and teaches empathy with others. Through meditative exercises, engaging anecdote, and expert insight, she reveals the enriching potential of reading for mindfulness.</description>

  <description>If you were raised to believe that painful emotions are a sign of weakness, or if being vulnerable has always made you feel unsafe, then you may have survived by creating a perfect-looking life—a life where you appear to be successful, engaged, and always there for others. The problem? You’re filled with self-criticism and shame, and you can’t allow yourself to express fear, anger, loss, or grief. You recognize something is wrong, but you’re not sure what exactly—only that you feel trapped and alone. If this sounds like you, you may have perfectly hidden depression (PHD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With this compassionate guide, you’ll begin the process of understanding your perfectionism, identifying destructive beliefs, and connecting with emotions suppressed for far too long. You’ll also find tangible tips for quieting that critical inner voice, and powerful strategies for coping with difficult feelings. Most importantly, you’ll learn that asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. If you’re ready to stop hiding and start healing, this groundbreaking book will guide you—every imperfect step of the way.</description>

  <description>In the emotional aftermath of her baby's sudden death, Em starts running. Soon she runs from her husband, to the airport, down to the Florida Gulf and out to the loneliest stretch of Vermillion Key, where her father has offered the use of a conch shack he has kept there for years. Em keeps up her running -- barefoot on the beach, sneakers on the road -- and sees virtually no one. This is doing her all kinds of good, until one day she makes the mistake of looking into the driveway of a man named Pickering. Pickering also enjoys the privacy of Vermillion Key, but the young women he brings there suffer the consequences. Will Em be next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Audio CDs / 2 Hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~</description>

  <description>In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls – including Jamie’s mother and beloved sister – feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again – a showman on stage, creating dazzling ‘portraits in lightning’ – and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil’s devising, and Jamie discovers that &lt;i&gt;revival&lt;/i&gt; has many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It’s a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.</description>

  <description>Anne Rice's Violin tells the story of two charismatic figures bound to each other by a passionate commitment to music as a means of rapture, seduction, and liberation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the novel's center: a uniquely fascinating woman, Triana, and the demonic fiddler Stefan, a tormented ghost who begins to prey upon her, using his magic violin to draw her into a state of madness. But Triana sets out to resist Stefan, and the struggle thrusts them both into a terrifying supernatural realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violin flows abundant with the history, the drama, and the romantic intensity that have become synonymous with Anne Rice at her incomparable best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Rice is the author of eighteen books. She lives in New Orleans.</description>

  <description>With &lt;i&gt;Pandora&lt;/i&gt;, Anne Rice began a magnificent new series of vampire novels. Now, in the second of her New Tales of the Vampires, she tells the mesmerizing story of Vittorio, a vampire in the Italian Age of Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Educated in the Florence of Cosimo de' Medici, trained in knighthood at his father's mountaintop castle, Vittorio inhabits a world of courtly splendor and country pleasures - a world suddenly threatened when his entire family is confronted by an unholy power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of this upheaval, Vittorio is seduced by the vampire Ursula, the most beautiful of his supernatural enemies. As he sets out in pursuit of vengeance, entering the nightmarish Court of the Ruby Grail, increasingly more enchanted (and confused) by his love for the mysterious Ursula, he finds himself facing demonic adversaries, war and political intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against a backdrop of the wonders - both sacred and profane - and the beauty and ferocity of Renaissance Italy, Anne Rice creates a passionate and tragic legend of doomed young love and lost innocence.</description>

  <description>Ramses the Great has reawakened in opulent Edwardian London. Having drunk the elixir of life, he is now Ramses the Damned, doomed forever to wander the earth, desperate to quell hungers that can never be satisfied. He becomes the close companion of a voluptuous heiress, Julie Stratford, but his cursed past again propels him toward disaster. He is tormented by searing memories of his last reawakening, at the behest of Cleopatra, his beloved queen of Egypt. And his intense longing for her, undiminished over the centuries, will force him to commit an act that will place everyone around him in the gravest danger.</description>

  <description>Anne Rice, creator of the Vampire Lestat, the Mayfair witches and the amazing worlds they inhabit, now gives us the first in a new series of novels linked together by the fledgling vampire David Talbot, who has set out to become a chronicler of his fellow Undead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel opens in present-day Paris in a crowded café, where David meets Pandora. She is two thousand years old, a Child of the Millennia, the first vampire ever made by the great Marius. David persuades her to tell the story of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.</description>

  <description>The Talamasca, documenters of paranormal activity, is on the hunt for the newly born Lasher. Mayfair women are dying from hemorrhages and a strange genetic anomaly has been found in Rowan and Michael. Lasher, born from Rowan, is another species altogether and now in the corporeal body, represents an incalcuable threat to the Mayfairs. Rowan and Lasher travel together to Houston and she becomes pregnant with another creature like him, a Taltos. Lasher seeks to reproduce his race in other women, but they cannot withstand it. Rowan escapes and becomes comatose as her fully-grown Taltos daughter is born. The Mayfairs declare all-out war on Lasher and try to nurse Rowan back to heatlth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael remains entwined in the Mayfair family and learns how he comes by his strange powers. Michael's ghostly visiting from a long-dead Mayfair reveals the importance of destroying Lasher. In the investigation, Lasher's origins are revealed, the new Taltos Emaleth returns, and the climax of death and life engulfs the family.&lt;br /&gt;--annerice.com</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From three-time &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Christopher Rice -- whose novels have been called "bold and ambitious" by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, "chillingly perverse" by USA Today, and "shocking, sexy...intricate" by Glamour -- comes this startling psychological thriller about an Iraq War vet who seeks redemption and revenge when a fellow Marine he failed to protect during the war is brutally murdered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Houck became a Marine to become a hero. But his life changed when he failed to notice an explosive device that ended up maiming the captain of his Force Recon Company, a respected Marine who nearly sacrificed himself to save John's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home from Iraq, John pays a visit to his former captain, only to discover the captain has been gruesomely murdered. John pursues a strange man he sees running from the scene, but he discovers that Alex Martin is not the murderer. Alex is, in fact, the former captain's secret male lover and the killer's intended next victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes clear that local law enforcement has direct connections to the murder itself, John realizes that to repay his debt of honor, he must teach Alex Martin how to protect himself, even if that means teaching Alex to kill. In the process, John confronts the painful truth about the younger brother he was unable to protect and the older sister he always felt he failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blind Fall&lt;/i&gt; is a story of honor and integrity, of turning failure into victory. It is a stunning departure for Christopher Rice: the story of two men, one a Marine, one gay, who must unite to avenge the death of the man they both loved -- one as a brother-in-arms, one as a lover -- and to survive.</description>

  <description>Adam Murphy wants to be a serious journalist. Unfortunately, he spends his days writing copy about underwear and abs for a gay lifestyle magazine. When a troubled young porn star brings him a tip about a recently deceased marine’s secret visit to an infamous pimp for underage boys, Adam is determined to break the story…until someone starts threatening his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undeterred, Adam begins to unravel a deadly conspiracy involving runaway sugar daddies, salacious A-list parties, and three handsome young men who have vanished without a trace. Now he must enter the seedy underbelly of LA to find the truth behind their disappearance, as well as the disappearance of his ex-lover, Corey—who may have some deadly secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this supercharged modern noir tale of sex, drugs, and revenge from New York Times bestselling author Christopher Rice, getting to the bottom of a scandalous story can be dangerous…if not downright fatal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised edition: This edition of Light Before Day includes editorial revisions.</description>

  <description>Four childhood friends in present-day New Orleans are torn apart by envy, passion, and a secret murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, Meredith, Brandon, Greg, and Stephen quickly discover the fragile boundaries between friendship and betrayal as they enter high school and form new allegiances. Meredith, Brandon, and Greg gain popularity, while Stephen is viciously treated as an outcast. Then two violent deaths destroy the already delicate bonds of their friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the friends are drawn back together, new facts about their mutual history are exposed and what was held to be a tragic accident is revealed as murder. As the true story emerges, other secrets begin to unravel with more dangerous, far-reaching consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Density of Souls&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning debut novel that uncovers the darker side of the teenage psyche.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some days you need a pick-me-up, some days you need a life preserver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “For most of us,” writes Anna Borges, “self-care is a wide spectrum of decisions and actions that soothe and fortify us against all the shit we deal with.” You may already practice some form of self-care, whether it’s taking an extra-long shower after a stressful day, splurging on a ~fancy~ dinner, or choosing Netflix over that friend-of-a-friend’s birthday party. But when life gets so overwhelming that you want to stay in bed, some more &lt;i&gt;radical&lt;/i&gt; care is crucial to maintain your sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The More or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care&lt;/i&gt; is here to help you exist in the world. Borges gathers over 200 tips, activities, and stories (from experts and everyday people alike) into an A-to-Z list—from &lt;b&gt;asking for help&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;burning negative thoughts&lt;/b&gt; to the importance of &lt;b&gt;touch&lt;/b&gt; and catching some &lt;b&gt;Zzz’s.&lt;/b&gt; Make any day a little more OK with new skills in your self-care toolkit—and energy to show up for yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The mental well-being of children and adults is shockingly poor. Marc Brackett, author of &lt;i&gt;Permission to Feel&lt;/i&gt;, knows why. And he knows what we can do. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We have a crisis on our hands, and its victims are our children."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Brackett is a professor in Yale University’s Child Study Center and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. In his 25 years as an emotion scientist, he has developed a remarkably effective plan to improve the lives of children and adults – a blueprint for understanding our emotions and using them wisely so that they help, rather than hinder, our success and well-being. The core of his approach is a legacy from his childhood, from an astute uncle who gave him permission to feel. He was the first adult who managed to see Marc, listen to him, and recognize the suffering, bullying, and abuse he’d endured. And that was the beginning of Marc’s awareness that what he was going through was temporary. He wasn’t alone, he wasn’t stuck on a timeline, and he wasn’t “wrong” to feel scared, isolated, and angry. Now, best of all, he could do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the decades since, Marc has led large research teams and raised tens of millions of dollars to investigate the roots of emotional well-being. His prescription for healthy children (and their parents, teachers, and schools) is a system called RULER, a high-impact and fast-effect approach to understanding and mastering emotions that has already transformed the thousands of schools that have adopted it. RULER has been proven to reduce stress and burnout, improve school climate, and enhance academic achievement. This book is the culmination of Marc’s development of RULER and his way to share the strategies and skills with readers around the world. It is tested, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book combines rigor, science, passion and inspiration in equal parts. Too many children and adults are suffering; they are ashamed of their feelings and emotionally unskilled, but they don’t have to be. Marc Brackett’s life mission is to reverse this course, and this book can show you how.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The groundbreaking science behind the surprising source of good health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stanford University’s Justin and Erica Sonnenburg are pioneers in the most exciting and potentially transformative field in the entire realm of human health and wellness, the study of the relationship between our bodies and the trillions of organisms representing thousands of species to which our bodies play host, the microbes that we collectively call the microbiota. The microbiota interacts with our bodies in a number of powerful ways; the Sonnenburgs argue that it determines in no small part whether we’re sick or healthy, fit or obese, sunny or moody. The microbiota has always been with us, and in fact has coevolved with humans, entwining its functions with ours so deeply, the Sonnenburgs show us, humans are really composite organisms having both microbial and human parts. But now, they argue, because of changes to diet, antibiotic over-use, and over-sterilization, our gut microbiota is facing a “mass extinction event,” which is causing our bodies to go haywire, and may be behind the mysterious spike in some of our most troubling modern afflictions, from food allergies to autism, cancer to depression. It doesn’t have to be this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good Gut&lt;/i&gt; offers a new plan for health that focuses on how to nourish your microbiota, including recipes and a menu plan. In this groundbreaking work, the Sonnenburgs show how we can keep our microbiota off the endangered species list and how we can strengthen the community that inhabits our gut and thereby improve our own health. The answer is unique for each of us, and it changes as you age. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this important and timely investigation, the Sonnenburgs look at safe alternatives to antibiotics; dietary and lifestyle choices to encourage microbial health; the management of the aging microbiota; and the nourishment of your own individual microbiome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caring for our gut microbes may be the most important health choice we can make.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A "powerful and indispensable book" on the devastating consequences of environmental racism--and what we can do to remedy its toxic effects on marginalized communities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle-class African-American households with incomes between $50,000 and $60,000 live in neighborhoods that are more polluted than those of very poor white households with incomes less than $10,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When swallowed, a lead-paint chip no larger than a fingernail can send a toddler into a coma. One-tenth of that amount will lower IQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly two out of every five African-American homes in Baltimore are plagued by lead-based paint. Almost all of the 37,500 Baltimore children who suffered lead poisoning from 2003 to 2015 were African-American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From injuries caused by lead poisoning to the devastating effects of atmospheric pollution, infectious disease, and industrial waste, Americans of color are harmed by environmental hazards in staggeringly disproportionate numbers. This systemic onslaught of toxic exposure and institutional negligence causes irreparable physical harm to millions of people across the country--cutting lives tragically short and needlessly burdening the health care system. But these deadly environments create another insidious and often overlooked consequence: robbing communities of color, and America as a whole, of intellectual power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1994 publication of &lt;i&gt;The Bell Curve&lt;/i&gt; and its controversial thesis, catapulted the topic of genetic racial differences in IQ to the forefront of a renewed and heated debate. Now, in &lt;i&gt;A Terrible Thing to Waste&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning science writer Harriet A. Washington adds her incisive analysis to the fray, arguing that IQ is a biased and flawed metric, but that it is useful for tracking cognitive damage. She tears apart the spurious notion of intelligence as an inherited trait, using copious data that instead point to a different cause of the reported African American-white IQ gap: environmental racism--a confluence of racism and other institutional factors that relegate marginalized communities to living and working near sites of toxic waste, pollution, and insufficient sanitation services. She investigates heavy metals, neuro-toxins, deficient prenatal care, bad nutrition, and even pathogens as chief agents influencing intelligence to explain why communities of color are disproportionately affected--and what can be done to remedy this devastating problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring extensive scientific research and Washington's sharp, lively reporting, &lt;i&gt;A Terrible Thing to Waste&lt;/i&gt; is sure to outrage, transform the conversation, and inspire debate.</description>

      <![CDATA[ A Terrible Thing to Waste in an interesting, well researched book. There is a lot of scientific jargon in the books, so despite clearly attempting to make the information available to the masses, I'm not sure that they succeed.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time ever, the beloved songs from &lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; are collected here in a charmingly-illustrated treasury, sure to be cherished by adults who grew up with Mister Rogers, and a new generation of children alike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; had a revolutionary impact on children's television, and on millions of children themselves. Through songs, puppets, and frank conversations, Mister Rogers instilled the values of kindness, patience, and self-esteem in his viewers, and most of all, taught children how loved they were, just by being themselves. &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; reimagines the songs from the show as poetry, ranging from the iconic ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") to the forgotten gems. The poem are funny, sweet, silly, and sincere, dealing with topics of difficult feelings, new siblings, everyday routines, imagination, and more. Perfect for bedtime, sing-along, or quiet time, this book of nostalgic and meaningful poetry is the perfect gift for every child--including the child in all of us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;OB/GYN, writer for &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Self&lt;/i&gt;, and host of the show &lt;i&gt;Jensplaining, &lt;/i&gt;Dr. Jen Gunter now delivers the definitive book on vaginal health, answering the questions you've always had but were afraid to ask--or couldn't find the right answers to. She has been called Twitter's resident gynecologist, the Internet's OB/GYN, and one of the fiercest advocates for women's health...and she's here to give you the straight talk on the topics she knows best.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does eating sugar cause yeast infections? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Does pubic hair have a function? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should you have a vulvovaginal care regimen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will your vagina shrivel up if you go without sex?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's the truth about the HPV vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many important questions, so much convincing, confusing, contradictory &lt;i&gt;mis&lt;/i&gt;information! In this age of click bait, pseudoscience, and celebrity-endorsed products, it's easy to be overwhelmed--whether it's websites, advice from well-meaning friends, uneducated partners, and even healthcare providers. So how do you separate facts from fiction? OB-GYN Jen Gunter, an expert on women's health--and the internet's most popular go-to doc&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;comes to the rescue with a book that debunks the myths and educates and empowers women. From reproductive health to the impact of antibiotics and probiotics, and the latest trends, including vaginal steaming, vaginal marijuana products, and jade eggs, Gunter takes us on a factual, fun-filled journey. Discover the truth about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The vaginal microbiome &lt;br /&gt; - Genital hygiene, lubricants, and hormone myths and fallacies &lt;br /&gt; - How diet impacts vaginal health &lt;br /&gt; - Stem cells and the vagina &lt;br /&gt; - Cosmetic vaginal surgery&lt;br /&gt; - What changes to expect during pregnancy, after childbirth, and through menopause&lt;br /&gt; - How medicine fails women by dismissing symptoms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Thongs vs. lace: the best underwear for vaginal health&lt;br /&gt; - How to select a tampon &lt;br /&gt; - The full glory of the clitoris and the myth of the G Spot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... And so much more. Whether you're a twenty-six-year-old worried that her labia are "uncool" or a sixty-six-year-old dealing with painful sex, this comprehensive guide is sure to become a lifelong trusted resource.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You may know him as Mango, Mr. Peepers, the gibberish-spouting Suel Forrester, or one half of the head-bopping brothers in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Night at the Roxbury.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Maybe you remember him as the forlorn gothic kid Azrael Abyss, Gay Hitler, or the guitarist in the "More Cowbell" sketch. Whichever it is, Chris Kattan has earned a spot in the hearts of a generation of comedy fans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Kattan has defied comparison, expectations, and sometimes gravity with his inimitable style of physical comedy. By creating some of the most memorable &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; characters, as well as his many roles in film and television, Kattan has remained one of the most fearless and versatile comedians in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long after Chris was labeled one of the improv group Groundlings' "must-see" performers in the company, he was cast on &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;--and within the first six weeks, Chris's film career also took off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time, Kattan opens up about eight seasons on &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, performing alongside friends and future legends including Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, and Tina Fey, and guest hosts from Charlize Theron to Tom Hanks to David Bowie. He also shares stories of his unusual childhood (involving a secluded mountain with zen monks) with Leonard Cohen and Alan Watts. &lt;em&gt;Baby, Don't Hurt Me&lt;/em&gt; offers an unprecedented look into Chris's life, from his fascinating relationship with Lorne Michaels, a private Valentine's Day dinner with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, an unforgettable flight with Beyonc�, and even breaking his neck on live television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby, Don't Hurt Me&lt;/em&gt; is a candid, revealing memoir from a timeless comedian and a window into the world of millennium-era &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, from the rehearsals to the after-after parties, as narrated by your hilarious and inspiring friend--who just so happened to be there for all of it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A powerful and practical guide to help you navigate racism, challenge privilege, manage stress and trauma, and begin to heal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing from racism is a journey that often involves reliving trauma and experiencing feelings of shame, guilt, and anxiety. This journey can be a bumpy ride, and before we begin healing, we need to gain an understanding of the role history plays in racial/ethnic myths and stereotypes. In so many ways, to heal from racism, you must re-educate yourself and unlearn the processes of racism. This book can help guide you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Racial Healing Handbook&lt;/i&gt; offers practical tools to help you navigate daily and past experiences of racism, challenge internalized negative messages and privileges, and handle feelings of stress and shame. You’ll also learn to develop a profound racial consciousness and conscientiousness, and heal from grief and trauma. Most importantly, you’ll discover the building blocks to creating a community of healing in a world still filled with racial microaggressions and discrimination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is not just about ending racial harm—it is about racial liberation. This journey is one that we must take together. It promises the possibility of moving through this pain and grief to experience the hope, resilience, and freedom that helps you not only self-actualize, but also makes the world a better place.</description>

  <description>Theodore was an unfortunate bear. &lt;br /&gt;Exquisite, knowledgeable, well-mannered and immaculately dressed (with his impressive red bow tie), he was what you would call a ‘gentle-bear’. &lt;br /&gt;For a teddy bear of his distinguished pedigree, one would expect nothing but the best of what life has to offer. But luck should have it that he would end up in the worst possible place on earth- the Chow family!&lt;br /&gt;The most terrible kind of family imaginable, his days were miserable.... to say the least. Every day he wished that the horrible family he's living with would disappear from his life. &lt;br /&gt;One day, the family went out for what seemed like a normal outing... But they never came back... &lt;br /&gt;Theodore's wish had come true....</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;There’s more than one way to stoke the flames of revenge…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Rowe spent the first seven years of her life in the hands of the only parents she knew—a pair of serial killers who murdered her mother and tried to shape Charlotte in their own twisted image. If only the nightmare had ended when she was rescued. Instead, her real father exploited her tabloid-ready story for fame and profit—until Charlotte finally broke free from her ghoulish past and fled. Just when she thinks she has buried her personal hell forever, Charlotte is swept into a frightening new ordeal. Secretly dosed with an experimental drug, she’s endowed with a shocking new power—but pursued by a treacherous corporation desperate to control her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except from now on, if anybody is going to control Charlotte, it’s going to be Charlotte herself. She’s determined to use the extraordinary ability she now possesses to fight the kind of evil that shattered her life—by drawing a serial killer out from the shadows to face the righteous fury of a victim turned avenger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An eye-opening, investigative account of the dismal state of women's healthcare in the U.S.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Elle&lt;/i&gt;'s "30 Best Books to Read This Summer"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American women visit more doctors, have more surgery, and fill more prescriptions than men. In &lt;i&gt;Everything Below the Waist, &lt;/i&gt;Jennifer Block asks: Why is the life expectancy of women today declining relative to women in other high-income countries, and even relative to the generation before them? Block examines several staples of modern women's health care, from fertility technology to contraception to pelvic surgery to miscarriage treatment, and finds that while overdiagnosis and overtreatment persist in medicine writ large, they are particularly acute for women. One third of mothers give birth by major surgery; roughly half of women lose their uterus to hysterectomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminism turned the world upside down, yet to a large extent the doctors' office has remained stuck in time. Block returns to the 1970s women's health movement to understand how in today's supposed age of empowerment, women's bodies are still so vulnerable to medical control--particularly their sex organs, and as result, their sex lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this urgent book, Block tells the stories of patients, clinicians, and reformers, uncovering history and science that could revolutionize the standard of care, and change the way women think about their health. &lt;i&gt;Everything Below the Waist &lt;/i&gt;challenges all people to take back control of their bodies.</description>

  <description>At once funny, wistful and unsettling, &lt;i&gt;Sum&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling exploration of unexpected afterlives—each presented as a vignette that offers a stunning lens through which to see ourselves in the here and now. In one afterlife, you may find that God is the size of a microbe and unaware of your existence. In another version, you work as a background character in other people’s dreams. Or you may find that God is a married couple, or that the universe is running backward, or that you are forced to live out your afterlife with annoying versions of who you could have been. With a probing imagination and deep understanding of the human condition, acclaimed neuroscientist David Eagleman offers wonderfully imagined tales that shine a brilliant light on the here and now.</description>

  <description>Bringing together a collection of narratives from those who are on the autism spectrum whilst also identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and/or asexual (LGBTQIA), this book explores the intersection of the two spectrums as well as the diverse experiences that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By providing knowledge and advice based on in-depth research and personal accounts, the narratives will be immensely valuable to teenagers, adults, partners and families. The authors round these stories with a discussion of themes across narratives, and implications for the issues discussed. In the final chapter, the authors reflect on commonly asked questions from a clinical perspective, bringing in relevant research, as well as sharing best-practice tips and considerations that may be helpful for LGBTQIA and ASD teenagers and adults. These may also be used by family members and clinicians when counselling teenagers and adults on the dual spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each chapter structured around LGBTQIA and autism spectrum identities, &lt;i&gt; Gender Identity, Sexuality and Autism&lt;/i&gt; highlights the fluidity of gender identity, sexual orientation and neurodiversity and provides a space for people to share their individual experiences.</description>

  <description>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Positive life changes lead to positive brain changes. Drawing on the huge success of his groundbreaking book, &lt;i&gt;The Upward Spiral&lt;/i&gt;, neuroscientist Alex Korb offers actionable, step-by-step skills to help you reshape your brain and create an upward spiral towards a happier, healthier life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depression is defined by a collection of symptoms. You feel crappy most of the time. Nothing seems interesting, and everything seems overwhelming. You have trouble with sleep. You feel guilty and anxious and have thoughts that life isn’t worth living. Each symptom reinforces and inspires new symptoms, and this is a sign that your brain circuits are caught in the downward spiral of depression. So, how can you reverse it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his first book, &lt;i&gt;The Upward Spiral&lt;/i&gt;, neuroscientist Alex Korb demystified the intricate brain processes that cause depression and outlined a practical and effective approach for getting better. Based on the latest research, this evidence-based workbook takes the theory behind Korb’s breakthrough book and distills it into concrete, actionable exercises and skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as one small trigger can drag you down, an effective intervention can start enough momentum to carry you back up. Exercise, attention to breathing, gratitude, sleep hygiene, and positive social interactions are just some of the offerings in this workbook that can help alter activity in specific neural circuits, setting you on the path toward an upward spiral to happiness and well-being.</description>

  <description>A hilarious, quirky, and unflinchingly honest memoir about one young woman's terrible and life-changing decisions while hoping (and sometimes failing) to find herself, in the style of &lt;i&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Adulting&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Dana Schwartz, Internet darling and delusional narcissist, on a journey revisiting all of the terrible decisions she made in her early twenties through the internet's favorite method of self-knowledge: the quiz. Part-memoir, part-VERY long personality test, CHOOSE YOUR OWN DISASTER will ask the reader to make the decision of what to do when...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...A moody, critically acclaimed novelist sends an Uber to bring you to his place at midnight; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...You're too embarrassed to tell the nice woman doing your bikini wax that she left a strip of wax gluing your butt cheeks together; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ...It turns out the guy you've been dating has Christian-Grey-style restraints on his bed and a drawer full of leather; 					&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 				 			 		 	 	 		 		 	 	 		 			 				 					 						CHOOSE YOUR OWN DISASTER is a manifesto about the millennial experience and modern feminism and how the easy advice of "you can be anything you want!" is actually 	 		 		 	 	 		pretty fucking difficult when there are so many possible versions of yourself it seems like you could be. Dana has no idea who she is, but at least she knows she's a Carrie, and a Slytherin, and a Raphael, and a Belle, and a Brown University, and a Patton. And yes... it will be written in the second person.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Gordon, founding member of Sonic Youth, fashion icon, and role model for a generation of women, now tells her story—a memoir of life as an artist, of music, marriage, motherhood, independence, and as one of the first women of rock and roll, written with the lyricism and haunting beauty of Patti Smith's &lt;em&gt;Just Kids&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often described as aloof, Kim Gordon opens up as never before in &lt;em&gt;Girl in a Band&lt;/em&gt;. Telling the story of her family, growing up in California in the '60s and '70s, her life in visual art, her move to New York City, the men in her life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music, and her band, &lt;em&gt;Girl in a Band&lt;/em&gt; is a rich and beautifully written memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gordon takes us back to the lost New York of the 1980s and '90s that gave rise to Sonic Youth, and the Alternative revolution in popular music. The band helped build a vocabulary of music—paving the way for Nirvana, Hole, Smashing Pumpkins and many other acts. But at its core, &lt;em&gt;Girl in a Band&lt;/em&gt; examines the route from girl to woman in uncharted territory, music, art career, what partnership means—and what happens when that identity dissolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evocative and edgy, filled with the sights and sounds of a changing world and a transformative life, &lt;em&gt;Girl in a Band&lt;/em&gt; is the fascinating chronicle of a remarkable journey and an extraordinary artist.</description>

  <description>Decoding Persistent Depression is the first book in a series which investigates long-term depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This text is based on and expands previous work and explores a condition known by its various aliases: dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder, neurotic depression, dysthymic depression, and chronic depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With playful, encouraging dialogue and examples, it comfortably exists between popular psychology and graduate-level books. While not a step-by-step self-help manual, the presented information can assist in developing understanding for symptomatic persons, as well as educators, friends, family, and healthcare providers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clues along the way will help you eliminate distracting, contradictory, misleading, and countertherapeutic concepts. As you gather illuminating evidence, you’ll be better able to comprehend and resolve an intriguing – and seemingly impenetrable – mystery, with all the usual suspects (and perhaps a few surprises): How can depression arise and why might it persist?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; is Carrie Fisher’s intimate, hilarious and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time, the first &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carrie Fisher recently discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie, she was astonished to see what they had preserved—plaintive love poems, unbridled musings with youthful naiveté, and a vulnerability that she barely recognized. Today, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon is indisputable, but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a (sort-of) regular teenager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; is Fisher’s intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time—and what developed behind the scenes. And today, as she reprises her most iconic role for the latest Star Wars trilogy, Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space royalty. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; brims with the candor and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight into the type of stardom that few will ever experience.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>I laughed, I cried, I watched Star Wars</strong><br /><br />This book happens to be quite amazing. The pieces of Carrie Fisher's 19 year old self's journal are filled with unexpected artwork. She is witty and open and joking about her death she didn't know would be so soon.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the author of the beloved &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling book &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;and the creator and star of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Mindy Project&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes a collection of essays that are as hilarious and insightful as they are deeply personal.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Why Not Me?, &lt;/i&gt; Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it's falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you're constantly reminded that no one looks like you. &lt;br /&gt; In "How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet's Confessions", Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, ("Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn't the land of appropriate-&lt;i&gt;this is Hollywood, baby&lt;/i&gt;. Out here, a dark-skinned woman s traditional hair color is honey blonde.") "Player" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. ("I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.") In "Unlikely Leading Lady", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses, ("Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.") And in "Soup Snakes", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak ("I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.") &lt;br /&gt; Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who've never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"While Tolliver slept, I wondered if it was possible that Cameron was still alive...At first, I'd thought she'd been abducted by a gang, sold into slavery, something lurid and horrible. Then I'd wondered if maybe she'd simply been fed up with her life: the tawdry parents and the tacky trailer, the sister who limped and looked abstracted, the baby sisters who never seemed to stay clean. Most days, though, I was sure she was dead."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightning-struck sleuth Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver take a break from looking for the dead to visit the two little girls they both think of as sisters. But, as always happens when they travel to Texas, memories of their horrible childhood resurface...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matter worse, Tolliver learns from his older brother that their father is out of jail and trying to reestablish contact with other family members. Tolliver wants nothing to do with the man - but he may not have a say in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, family secrets ensnare them both, as Harper finally discovers what happened to her missing sister, Cameron, so may years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what she finds out will change her world forever...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When I was fifteen, I was struck by a bolt of lightning through an open window of the trailer where we lived...I recovered, mostly. I have a strange spiderweb pattern of red on my torso and right leg, which has episodes of weakness. Sometimes my right hand shakes. I have headaches. I have many fears. And I can find dead people. That was the part that interested the professor...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the request of anthropology professor Dr. Clyde Nunley, Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver come to Memphis to give a demonstration of Harper's unique talent. And what better place to have that demonstration than in a very old cemetery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nunley doesn't bother to hide his skepticism, especially when Harper stands atop a grave and senses &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; bodies beneath her - one of a centuries-dead man and the other of a young girl, recently deceased. When the grave is opened, Harper's claim is proven true. The dead girl is Tabitha Morgenstern, an eleven-year-old abducted from Nashville two years previously - a child whom Harper had tried, and failed, to find. The coincidence raises suspicions about her among the police - so she and Tolliver undertake their own hunt to find the killer. They make a nocturnal visit to the cemetery, hoping that Harper can sense something further about the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, the next morning, a third dead body is found in the grave...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I read an ARC of Psychology of Zelda from Net Galley. It was an amazing read. This is the third Psychology of Pop Culture book that I've read. I adore all of them, but this one has to be my favorite. Now, there is quite a lot of Jungian theory included in the book, so if that doesn't interest you...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The greatest battles we face are with ourselves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ​In&lt;i&gt; You vs You&lt;/i&gt;, author Todd Cahill starts with a simple premise: As people strive for any improvement in their lives—whether it’s more income, a better relationship, a promotion, a bigger business, or a better body—the most important battles they will face are against themselves. People invite problems into their lives through poor choices, apathy, indecision, arrogance, anxiety, selfishness, and other traits they would rather not discuss but must be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this valuable book, Cahill shares what he has learned about these battles that either keep people from success and significance or usher them to victory. As a life coach and leadership trainer, he has taught thousands of people these lessons, and many of them are now experiencing a level of personal achievement, relational abundance, and financial freedom they never thought possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; People often self-sabotage if they’re not mindful, wise, and willing. Cahill reinforces the idea that readers can choose today to fight against who they once were (or are) and become who they are made to be. &lt;i&gt;You vs You&lt;/i&gt; is about that choice and the challenging, rewarding quest that ensues.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time ever, the beloved songs from &lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; are collected here in a charmingly-illustrated treasury, sure to be cherished by adults who grew up with Mister Rogers, and a new generation of children alike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; had a revolutionary impact on children's television, and on millions of children themselves. Through songs, puppets, and frank conversations, Mister Rogers instilled the values of kindness, patience, and self-esteem in his viewers, and most of all, taught children how loved they were, just by being themselves. &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; reimagines the songs from the show as poetry, ranging from the iconic ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") to the forgotten gems. The poem are funny, sweet, silly, and sincere, dealing with topics of difficult feelings, new siblings, everyday routines, imagination, and more. Perfect for bedtime, sing-along, or quiet time, this book of nostalgic and meaningful poetry is the perfect gift for every child--including the child in all of us.</description>

  <description>First published in 2001, here is the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel that became an instant classic and was hailed by &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; as “a powerful, searing force that makes readers confront what is real and what is not…”—now a TV series from FremantleMedia North America is coming to STARZ with Bryan Fuller and Michael Green as showrunners, and starring Ricky Whittle, Ian McShane, Crispin Glover, Cloris Leachman, and Gillian Anderson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and a rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as Wednesday’s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined. Soon Shadow learns that the past never dies... and that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“Original, engrossing, and endlessly inventive.”—George R. R. Martin&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>More than thirty years ago, a classic was born. A searing novel of the Mafia underworld, The Godfather introduced readers to the first family of American crime fiction, the Corleones, and the powerful legacy of tradition, blood, and honor that was passed on from father to son. With its themes of the seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed, and family allegiance, it resonated with millions of readers across the world?and became the definitive novel of the virile, violent subculture that remains steeped in intrigue, in controversy, and in our collective consciousness.</description>

  <description>Librarian. Assassin. Vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber Fang enjoys life's simple pleasures - a good book, a glass of wine and, of course, a great meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised to eat ethically, Amber dines only on delicious, cold-blooded killers. But being sure they’re actually killers takes time… research… patience.&lt;br /&gt;It’s a good thing Amber’s a librarian. Her extraordinary skills help her hunt down her prey, seek out other vampires, and stay on the trail of her mother, missing now for two years. One day she stalks a rather tasty-looking murderer and things get messy. Very messy. Amber, the hunter, becomes the hunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, from out of nowhere, the perfect job offer: Assassin. She’d be paid to eat the world’s worst butchers. How ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber Fang is the first book in a new action and adventure vampire series by bestselling author Arthur Slade. It’s a mind-bending mix of full throttle action with a pinch of comedy and a dash of romance.</description>

      <![CDATA[I received an arc of this book from Net Galley. The book is written in an extremely straight forward manner. It felt as if the interesting parts were cut out to make the vampire feel nicer. I couldn't gain any interest in the characters and story. Half way through the book, I stopped trying. ]]>

  <description>Elizabeth Bennet is Austen’s most liberated and unambiguously appealing heroine, and Pride and Prejudice has remained over most of the past two centuries Austen’s most popular novel. The story turns on the marriage prospects of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet: Elizabeth forms a prejudice against the proud and distant Mr. Darcy; Darcy’s charming friend Charles Bingley falls in love with her sister Jane; and the handsome officer George Wickham forms attachments successively to Elizabeth and to her sister Lydia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irvine’s extensive introduction sets the novel in the context of the literary and intellectual history of the period, and deals with such crucial background issues as early-nineteenth century class relations in Britain, and female exclusion from property and power. The appendices present an unrivaled selection of background contextual documents.&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This inspiring true story of how classical music saved a young girl's life during World War II is a book for history and music lovers and the perfect choice for book clubs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Mona Golabek tells the tale of her mother Lisa Jura Golabek's escape from Nazi-controlled Austria to England on the infamous Kindertransport. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jewish musical prodigy Lisa Jura has a wonderful life in Vienna. But when the Nazis start closing in on the city, life changes irreversibly. Although he has three daughters, Lisa's father is able to secure only one berth on the Kindertransport. The family decides to send Lisa to London so that she may pursue her dreams of a career as a concert pianist. Separated from her beloved family, Lisa bravely endures the trip and a disastrous posting outside London before finding her way to the Willesden Lane Orphanage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her music inspires the other orphanage children, and they, in turn, cheer her on in her efforts to make good on her promise to her family to realize her musical potential. Through hard work and sheer pluck, Lisa wins a scholarship to study piano at the Royal Academy. As she supports herself and studies, she makes a new life for herself and dreams of reconnecting with the family she was forced to leave behind. The resulting tale delivers a message of the power of music to uplift the human spirit and to grant the individual soul endurance, patience, and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Includes a reading group guide*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>According to &lt;i&gt;The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Witch&lt;/i&gt; (the world's only &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . . </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;WHO YOU ARE MEANT TO BE, THE ENNEAGRAM EFFECT&lt;/i&gt; is about remembering who you are at your essence. It is about thriving, not just surviving. This transformation is a lifelong process and Enneagram wisdom is motivating! If the foundational relationship with the self is the one from which all other relationships are formed, it makes good sense to awaken to who you are, and who you came here to be. We are all resourceful on some level, and as we transform patterns and behaviors that do not work for us, and heal old wounds, we grow within the personality we have been given.

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of &lt;i&gt;Girls Trip&lt;/i&gt;, Tiffany Haddish, comes&lt;i&gt; The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt;, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.</description>

  <description>Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, is about to have a very bad day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because as Winter Knight to the Queen of Air and Darkness, Harry never knows what the scheming Mab might want him to do. Usually, it’s something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t know the half of it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mab has just traded Harry’s skills to pay off one of her debts. And now he must help a group of supernatural villains—led by one of Harry’s most dreaded and despised enemies, Nicodemus Archleone—to break into the highest-security vault in town, so that they can then access the highest-security vault in the Nevernever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a smash and grab job to recover the literal Holy Grail from the vaults of the greatest treasure hoard in the supernatural world—which belongs to the one and only Hades, Lord of the freaking Underworld and generally unpleasant character. Worse, Dresden suspects that there is another game afoot that no one is talking about. And he's dead certain that Nicodemus has no intention of allowing any of his crew to survive the experience. Especially Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dresden's always been tricky, but he's going to have to up his backstabbing game to survive this mess—assuming his own allies don’t end up killing him before his enemies get the chance…</description>

  <description>Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face–including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was a short, beautiful, Stephen King novel. The entirety of the novel was quaint, endearing, and at times a little mystifying. The characters were captivating, and I often wanted to reach out and hug them. Everything about it created a nicer, better world (in Castle Rock). The writing w...]]>

  <description>Annie Murphy can sometimes tell the future. It’s the past she has trouble with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her brother’s witch-girlfriend goes missing days after an invocation ritual, Annie has every reason to suspect him. But he says he didn’t do it, and Annie isn’t about to send another innocent man in her family to jail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a confrontation with her brother Johnny turns violent, Annie flees into the worst blizzard to hit the area in years. Led by her Sight, she arrives at a rundown inn where she meets Crow. Another powerful psychic—and a witch that can control her namesake birds—Crow seems to be hated, feared, respected and loved, all at the same time. Soon Annie begins to wonder about things. Like why Crow appears to be connected to every suspicious disappearance over the past fifty years in the small town of Raven City. Why Johnny’s missing girlfriend might be one of them. Why Crow has walked free every single time. And if Annie doesn’t stop her, why she might again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Contains swear words, violence, and dark themes. Recommended for readers 15 and up.</description>

  <description>A serial killer is terrorizing Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;Private investigator Karen Hunter agrees to locate a teen who has gone missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mother is frantic to find the son she kicked out for being gay before he becomes the killer’s next victim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen encounters layers of lies from suspicious teens and the sleazy adults who prey upon them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she realizes she’s out of her depth, Karen enlists the aid of homicide detective Court Pearson, the only cop she can trust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the evidence pushes Karen closer to the killer, Court tells her to concentrate on finding the kid before she gets hurt and let the cops handle the big stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced the teen is in danger, Karen presses ahead, risking her career and life to save him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two princesses. One prince. And the war has just begun.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time… &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Ava was sent to a neighbouring kingdom as a lady-in-waiting to her sister, their future queen. Until a runaway horse, a case of amnesia and a cold-hearted king conspire to bring her to the prince's attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the prince believes Ava is his bride, and her sister is just a serving maid. One thing is certain: the prince must marry one of the princesses, or there will be war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when all's fair in love and war…who will win the battle for the prince's heart? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romance a Medieval Fairytale series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book is a standalone, so they can be read in any order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33627778-enchant" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#1) Enchant: Beauty and the Beast Retold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33801795-dance" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#2) Dance: Cinderella Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36345735-fly" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#3) Fly: Goose Girl Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34224098-revel" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#4) Revel: Twelve Dancing Princesses Retold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34822522-silence" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#5) Silence: Little Mermaid Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33801752-awaken" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#6) Awaken: Sleeping Beauty Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35528035-embellish" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#7) Embellish: Brave Little Tailor Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35921045-appease" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#8) Appease: Princess and the Pea Retold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36065160-blow" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#9) Blow: Three Little Pigs Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38235947-return" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#10) Return: Hansel and Gretel Retold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36397238-wish" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#11) Wish: Aladdin Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39714007-melt" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#12) Melt: Snow Queen Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40010149-spin" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#13) Spin: Rumpelstiltskin Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40191862-kiss" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#14) Kiss: Frog Prince Retold &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40846598-hunt" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#15) Hunt: Red Riding Hood Retold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41815414-reflect" rel="nofollow"&gt;(#16) Reflect: Snow White Retold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39701903-roar" rel="nofollow"&gt; (#17) Roar: Goldilocks Retold&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An urgently needed guide to the alarming increase in anxiety and stress experienced by girls from elementary school through college, from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Untangled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though anxiety has risen among young people overall, studies confirm that it has skyrocketed in girls. Research finds that the number of girls who said that they often felt nervous, worried, or fearful jumped 55 percent from 2009 to 2014, while the comparable number for adolescent boys has remained unchanged. As a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with girls, Lisa Damour, Ph.D., has witnessed this rising tide of stress and anxiety in her own research, in private practice, and in the all-girls' school where she consults. She knew this had to be the topic of her new book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first book, &lt;i&gt; Untangled&lt;/i&gt;, Damour starts by addressing the facts about psychological pressure. She explains the surprising and underappreciated &lt;i&gt;value &lt;/i&gt;of stress and anxiety: that stress can helpfully stretch us beyond our comfort zones, and anxiety can play a key role in keeping girls safe. When we emphasize the &lt;i&gt;benefits&lt;/i&gt; of stress and anxiety, we can help our daughters take them in stride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no parents want their daughter to suffer from emotional overload, so Damour then turns to the many facets of girls' lives where tension takes hold: their interactions at home, pressures at school, social anxiety among other girls and among boys, and their lives online. As readers move through the layers of girls' lives, they'll learn about the critical steps that adults can take to shield their daughters from the toxic pressures to which our culture--including we, as parents--subjects girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers who know Damour from &lt;i&gt;Untangled&lt;/i&gt; or the &lt;i&gt;New York Times, &lt;/i&gt; or from her regular appearances on &lt;i&gt;CBS News, &lt;/i&gt; will be drawn to this important new contribution to understanding and supporting today's girls.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt;, a humor memoir tinged with just enough tragedy and pathos to make it worthwhile, Jenny Lawson examines her own experience with severe depression and a host of other conditions, and explains how it has led her to live life to the fullest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I've often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that ‘normal people' also might never understand. And that's what &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt; is all about."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny’s readings are standing room only, with fans lining up to have Jenny sign their bottles of Xanax or Prozac as often as they are to have her sign their books. &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt; appeals to Jenny's core fan base but also transcends it. There are &lt;i&gt;so many&lt;/i&gt; people out there struggling with depression and mental illness, either themselves or someone in their family—and in &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt; they will find a member of their tribe offering up an uplifting message (via a taxidermied roadkill raccoon). &lt;i&gt;Let's Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/i&gt; ostensibly was about embracing your own weirdness, but deep down it was about family. &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt; is about depression and mental illness, but deep down it's about joy—and who doesn't want a bit more of that?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The alternate cover edition of this book can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20985371-hope-less" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our world is being judged and we remain unaware.&lt;p&gt;In a world filled with people, Gabby is uniquely alone. The tiny glowing sparks filling her mind that represent the people around her, confirm it as does the bizarre inexplicable draw she has on men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to find an explanation for her sight while dodging unwanted male attention, Gabby meets Sam. The chance encounter leads to a startling revelation - werewolves are real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping the existence of something so extraordinary might lead to the answers she is seeking, Gabby enters into a hidden society where fur is optional. There she meets Clay, the werewolf delusional enough to think he has a chance with her. Gabby's plans for her future do not include a mate, but rather college, career, and then a huge 'we'll see'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabby leaves the furry hidden society behind when she moves off to college, but trouble has a way of following and finding her. When other werewolves start stalking her, and anomalies in the sparks she sees begin to appear, she must count on Clay's help or risk loosing the chance to find the answers she searches for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three brothers. Three Secrets. One hope to save the shifters of Seattle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former SEAL Jaxson River would give his life for his brothers and his pack, but if he doesn’t claim a mate soon, he’ll be forced to step down as their alpha. There’s only one problem: Jaxson’s dark secret would kill any mate he claimed. With someone kidnapping shifters off the street—and only Jaxson and his brothers, Jace and Jared, to stop them—now is not the time for his secret to come out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curvy Olivia Lilyfield is a half-witch orphan with a dark secret of her own. She wants to atone for it by doing good in the world, so when she finds a wolf being tortured in an alley, she doesn’t hesitate to help… even though wolves and witches mix like matches and TNT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia’s dangerous magic means she can’t let anyone get too close — but Jaxson can’t keep his hands off her, and his kisses are more than she can resist. As they race to save the disappearing shifters of Seattle, the true danger lies in loving each other. They’re playing with magical fire… and their secrets could end up destroying them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jaxson&lt;/i&gt; is a complete novel with HEA, the first in the River Pack Wolves trilogy (&lt;i&gt;Jace&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jared&lt;/i&gt; coming soon).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contains scorching shifter sex, alpha military heroes, and sexy witches. Only readers over 18 should dive into the deliciously hot world of the River brothers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This a previously-published edition of ASIN B014ZHGHYQ.)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Even in a world of freaks, being a Firestarter is considered a dangerous Gift.&lt;p&gt;Lucy was born with the ability to create and control fire. She longs to leave the human world for one filled with Earthshakers, Transporters, and Chameleons, to name a few. When she rejoins the circus, it’s everything she hoped it could be - new friends, a potential love interest or two, and a place where she can be herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troupe members begin turning up dead, however, Lucy is suspected of foul play. She must not only prove her innocence but also realize the full extent of her power. To find the real murderer, she must uncover the truth behind her father’s fiery legacy while figuring out whom to trust within her new circle. Little does she know the history of the Donovan Circus and its enemies might actually destroy the entire gifted world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description> Can she find the missing girl before it’s too late?  &lt;br /&gt;Detective Shannon Martin believes Autumn Rain’s gift is a hoax. But he is desperate to find the missing little girl. Can they put aside their differences and find her before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn Rain didn’t always possess the ability to read emotions imprinted on objects. If you’ve enjoyed the Imprints series or are just beginning the adventure, you don’t want to miss this new prequel about Autumn's first case as a consultant to the Portland Police Bureau. See how she came into her ability, and how Detective Shannon Martin reacts when he realizes this crazy so-called psychic might just be telling the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can they put aside their differences and find a missing girl before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; From the author:   &lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy this introduction to my Imprints series. Readers have asked me for this story, so here it is! Though this is a shorter story and as such cannot contain the intricacies of the rest of the series, it is a complete book with no cliffhangers. Enjoy! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>River,&lt;br /&gt;It has been thirteen years since the war started, the bombs were dropped, and the central states became a thing of the past. When the war ended, a wall was erected to divide the surviving states from those destroyed. I never expected to go beyond the wall but unlike all the others who volunteered to go, I wasn’t given a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dim knowledge of what I could do, the soldiers came for me. They took me beyond the wall where I learned that the truth is far more terrifying than I’d ever dreamed. Alone, with humans and demons seeking to learn what it is I can do, I find myself irresistibly drawn to the one man I should be avoiding most. One who intrigues and infuriates me. One who is not even a man, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kobal,&lt;br /&gt;My entire life, I’ve had only one mission, reclaim my throne from Lucifer and put right everything that was torn apart when he was cast from Heaven. It’s a mission I haven’t wavered from, not even when the humans tore open the gates and unleashed Hell on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’ve never been closer to obtaining my goal yet I find myself risking it all because I cannot stay away from her, a human who may be the key to it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This Series will follow Kobal and River throughout. Not all things will be resolved in this book. Due to graphic language, violence and sexual content this book is recommended for readers 18+ years of age.***</description>

  <description>Ava’s sick of mundane angel duties. She wants a promotion to finally earn her wings. A promotion takes more than hard work; it takes a miracle—literally. Unfortunately, her miracle’s impossible, as it involves a vampire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fin has no time for frivolous gestures. He’s too busy avoiding his own kind to care what a naïve angel wants. But when the other vampires uncover his deepest secret, threatening what he cherishes most, nothing can help him except a miracle. Too bad he chased the angel away.</description>

  <description>The young haremaid Dotti and the badger-warrior Lord Brocktree—unlikely comrades—set out for Salamandastron together, only to discover the legendary mountain has been captured by the wildcat Ungatt Trunn and his Blue Hordes. To face them, the two must rally an army—hares and otters, shrews and moles, mice and squirrels—and execute a plan that makes up in cleverness what it lacks in force.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Max was interested in helping children understand their value - not from the world's perspective, but from God's. Wemmicksville is a land created by Eli, the "God" figure of the story. He creates each Wemmick in Wemmicksville uniquely, each with its own look and personality. Each story and video is a new adventure with the citizens of Wemmicksville. Punchinello is the central character, along with his friends Lucia, Splint, and Chip. When Punchinello strays from Eli, he begins to have problems. Only when Punchinello stays close to Eli does he clearly see how to walk through his life in Wemmicksville.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this heartwarming tale, Eli helps Punchinello understand how special he is-no matter what other Wemmicks may think. Children will learn a vital lesson-regardless of how the world sees them, God loves each of them just as they are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A harrowing story of breakdowns, suicide attempts, drug therapy, and an eventual journey back to living, this poignant and often hilarious book gives voice to the high incidence of depression among America's youth. A collective cry for help from a generation who have come of age entrenched in the culture of divorce, economic instability, and AIDS, here is the intensely personal story of a young girl full of promise, whose mood swings have risen and fallen like the lines of a sad ballad.</description>

  <description>My life used to be so simple. Get in, outsex a pesky incubus and get out with the cash. The vampires changed that. I hate vampires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the Demon Child woke and went on a feeding spree. He’s strong, lightning fast and as cute as a button. I fight demons by using my sexual aura, which makes hunting a vamp who looks like a kid totally wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the new mayor wants the paranormal world exposed. Not only does that cut into my income, it will lead to open warfare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the only ones paying me to hunt the Demon Child are a pair of screwed up vampires: Nic - the motivational speaker, I don’t know whether I want to kill him, screw him or cut off his perfect face and wear it as a mask - and Kisho, who would be the perfect man, if it wasn’t for his vampirism. Oh, and that he’s Nic’s bitch, when I want him to be mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mayor wants me on his team, I’m under investigation by the Demon Fighter Council - working for the enemy is strictly forbidden and, for the first time ever, I doubt my ability to get the job done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could my life get any more complicated? Oh yeah, the Demon Child has a secret that makes him unkillable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: may contain traces of unicorn.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are no such things as heroes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went out for coffee. I came back with a nemesis. &lt;br /&gt;The city’s favorite hero, Lightning, saved me from getting gunned down, and I thought my luck was finally changing. Not only was I not dead; I also managed to snag an exclusive interview with the masked &lt;i&gt;supe.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only, instead of job stability and internet fame, I earned the attention of every dangerous criminal in the city. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that’ll save my life now is allowing Lightning to claim me as his pet. To offer my body in the hopes that he’ll protect me. &lt;br /&gt;But the city has it wrong. He’s not one of the good guys. And submitting to his claim will bring another darkness from the shadows. A darkness whose only goal is to take anything his archenemy possesses. &lt;br /&gt;Including me.</description>

      <![CDATA[Very enjoyable read. The action and the erotica were fast moving and clear. Each piece furthered the storyline; the erotica and action fed into the characters and never seperated from it. I was able to stay with the book and quickly read it.]]>

  <description>Wendy doesn't remember anything about Neverland—or the experiments done on her there as a child. Seven years later, all she wants is a normal life, but shape-shifting shadows plague her dreams and turn her life into a waking nightmare. When the shadows attack at a football game and a boy disappears right in front of her, she realizes these wraith-like shadows are real. They’re not just haunting—they’re hunting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A mysterious boy named Peter, his foul-mouthed sidekick, and a band of misfit boys intervene before Wendy faces a similar fate. But can they trust Wendy enough to take her to Neverwood Academy and reveal all of their hidden secrets when she's hiding a secret of her own, or will the dreaded Red Skulls find her and drag her back to Neverland?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Expecting Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; is a multi-award-winning memoir and a Kirkus Review BEST INDIE BOOK of 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has experienced—or knows someone who has experienced—miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, or other forms of pregnancy and baby loss should read &lt;em&gt;Expecting Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, including those considering or already pregnant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her son, Zachary, dies in her arms at birth, visual artist and author Alexis Marie Chute disappears into her “Year of Distraction.” She cannot paint or write or tap into the heart of who she used to be, mourning not only for Zachary, but also for the future they might have had together. It is only when Chute learns she is pregnant again that she sets out to find healing and rediscover her identity—just in time, she hopes, to welcome her next child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the forty weeks of her pregnancy, Chute grapples with her strained marriage, shaken faith, and medical diagnosis, with profound results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glowing with riveting and gorgeous prose, &lt;em&gt;Expecting Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the anticipation and anxiety of expecting a baby while still grieving for the child that came before—enveloping readers with insightful observations on grief and healing, life and death, and the incredible power of a mother’s love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Edition includes: Bonus chapter written from the author’s husband’s perspective. Plus, resource section, group discussion questions, and Q&amp;amp;A with author Alexis Marie Chute</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nicholas Sayre will do anything to get across the Wall.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts of Lirael and Sam haunt his dreams, and he has come to realize that his destiny lies with them, in the Old Kingdom. But here in Ancelstierre, Nick faces an obstacle that is not entirely human, with a strange power that seems to come from Nicholas himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case&lt;/i&gt; Garth Nix continues to explore the magical world of the Abhorsen Trilogy. In additional short stories that range from two widely different takes on the Merlin myth to a gritty urban version of Hansel and Gretel and a heartbreaking story of children and war, Garth Nix displays the range and versatility that has made him one of today’s leading writers of fantasy for readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>Lirael has never felt like a true daughter of the Clayr. Now, two years past the time when she should have received the Sight that is the Clayr's birthright, she feels alone, abandoned, unsure of who she is. Nevertheless, the fate of the Old Kingdom lies in her hands. With only her faithful companion, the Disreputable Dog, Lirael must undertake a desperate mission under the growing shadow of an ancient evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel to Sabriel, winner of the Aurealis Award for Excellence in Australian Science Fiction, New York Times best-selling author Garth Nix weaves a spellbinding tale of discovery, destiny, and danger.</description>

  <description>Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom. But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sabriel, the first installment in the Abhorsen series, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear—and sometimes disappears altogether.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; legend and veteran author William Shatner discusses the meaning of life, finding value in work, and living well whatever your age.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I have always felt," William Shatner says early in his newest memoir, that "like the great comedian George Burns, who lived to 100, I couldn't die as long as I was booked." And Shatner is always booked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a brief health scare in 2016 forced him to take stock. After mulling over the lessons he's learned, the places he's been, and all the miracles and strange occurrences he's witnessed over the course of an enduring career in Hollywood and on the stage, he arrived at one simple rule for living a long and good life: don't die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the only one-size-fits-all advice, Shatner argues in &lt;i&gt;Live Long and..: What I Might Have Learned Along the Way&lt;/i&gt;, because everyone has a unique life--but, to help us all out, he's more than willing to share stories from &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; unique life. With a combination of pithy humor and thoughtful vulnerability, Shatner lays out his journey from childhood to peak stardom and all the bumps in the road. (Sometimes the literal road, as in the case of his 2,400-mile motorcycle trip across the country with a bike that didn't function.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Shatner is one of our most beloved entertainers, and he intends never to stop entertaining. His funny, provocative, and poignant reflections offer an unforgettable read about a remarkable man.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an enjoyable book that does exactly what it promised. I received the book as a free ARC from a Goodreads giveaway. It is William Shatner, in his voice, discussing some of the hardest things that it can take years to know. In the very beginning, he promises that this is not a book of advic...]]>

This is a book that offers readers a powerful path to use meditation as a tool to transform their lives."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is an exceptional book for all who strive to grow and empower themselves... I found this book inspirational and empowering because I am the one finding my own answers through meditation."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A guide on finding our purpose, removing self-doubt and fear while improving happiness, positive thoughts, love, relationships, and intuition - “Purpose - Volume I” is an exploration of the meaning of purpose: What is purpose? What is our purpose? How do we find it? Where do we look? What gets in the way of seeing it? What other questions can we ask ourselves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to have clarity about ourselves that enables us to understand ourselves totally so we never have to rely on any belief? If we can look and see clearly for ourselves, are beliefs necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the topics we explore include but aren't limited to the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using meditation as a tool for self-inquiry and observation&lt;br /&gt;Mastering the mind through the mastery of love, which doesn't oppose&lt;br /&gt;Empowering ourselves through mastery of the mind&lt;br /&gt;Love as our natural state, which can be hidden or denied but never destroyed&lt;br /&gt;Darkness as the false in us to be undone through total understanding of ourselves&lt;br /&gt;Unity of purpose as the foundation of our thinking versus the belief in separation as the foundation of our thinking&lt;br /&gt;Mental Strength&lt;br /&gt;The strength of unity in relation to mental strength&lt;br /&gt;How fear and violence arise in our thinking&lt;br /&gt;Uncovering our resistance to life and freeing ourselves from that resistance&lt;br /&gt;Relationships, death, intuition, intelligence, greed, joy, forgiveness, and integrity&lt;br /&gt;Respecting the power of belief&lt;br /&gt;Boundaries versus defenses&lt;br /&gt;Duality versus nonduality&lt;br /&gt;The mastery of love versus the mastery of darkness&lt;br /&gt;Purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed By Christian Sia for Readers' Favorite &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A first volume for a promising, refreshing, and inspiring series, Purpose - Volume I: Meditation on Love, Relationship, Fear, Death, Intuition, And Power by Noura is a ground-breaking self-help book that is both insightful and intelligently crafted, a book for readers who want to generously embrace life and find the peace and serenity that come with living with a purpose. In this guide, the author helps readers to understand their inner resistance to change and to reality, and what stands in their way of living life fully, touching brilliantly on important topics like forgiveness, the gift of difficult relationships, handling limitations and transforming them into opportunities, understanding the darkness that slowly steals into the human soul and mastering it, and a lot more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a book that offers readers a powerful path to use meditation as a tool to transform their lives. The book is packed with information and startling revelations, insights into the beauty of meditation and what it takes to allow it to transform and enrich our lives. Noura's writing is limpid and one can feel its graceful power moving through every word and every sentence she writes. The message goes straight to the heart of the reader. The author has the uncanny gift of making readers think about the reality, compelling them to see the inner meaning of things that could otherwise seem absurd. You will change the way you look at yourself, at others, and at life after reading Purpose - Volume I: Meditation on Love, Relationship, Fear, Death, Intuition, and Power. It's a gift for people seeking a meaningful way of leading their lives.</description>

  <description>Jewish traditional foods often have symbolic meanings that few Jews are aware of. A Passover matzo is a taste of Egyptian slavery. The Hanukah latke reminds us of the little jug of oil that burned, miraculously, for eight nights. Noshing hamantashen at Purim, we remember the villain Haman, and his thwarted plan to destroy the Jews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more than in the synagogue, Jewish life takes place around the dining table. Jewish sages compare the dining table to an altar, and that isn’t an exaggeration. Jewish meals—not only on the Shabbat and holidays, but even weekday suppers—are ceremonies and celebrations that forge a pathway between body and soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unique cookbook, Carol Ungar links the cultural and religious symbolism of Jewish foods to more than one hundred recipes drawn from Jewish cultures and traditions around the world. She offers easy-to-follow recipes for Shabbat meals and all the Jewish holidays, from Rosh Hashanah to the Nine Days and Tisha B’Av, along with fascinating briefs on how many Jewish foods—challah, kreplach, farfel, lentil soup, and more—express core Jewish beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With ingredients that can be found in any supermarket, and recipes adapted for the time- and health-conscious cook, this volume is for anyone who wishes to flavor Shabbat and holiday meals with Jewish soul.</description>

  <description>Three young souls are locked into a life and death struggle inside a bloodthirsty youth culture. &lt;br /&gt;Fire, wilderness, poisoned steel and catacombs. Get ready for Alastar's urban war. &lt;br /&gt;Being born was easy. Being stolen from our mothers — tougher, but Alastar and Sophia had to focus on two things: accruing strength and survival. &lt;br /&gt;Being different didn't help Sophia because extreme sensitivity isn't always a gift. It helped Alastar though because he had been born cold — like all of the best soldier class operatives. &lt;br /&gt;Survival of the ruthless is the norm, but it’s the will of the Legend that’s the new rule.&lt;br /&gt;Embedded with lethal peers, treacherous allies, and facing daily dangers — Sophia still has hope. With so little in their favour can these young operatives find a way to fulfill their destinies — or will they lose themselves to the greater struggle?</description>

  <description>Days before his release from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic Mr Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scary, gripping and deeply unsettling, &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; takes a long, hard look into the soul of America. You'll be surprised by what - and who - it finds there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the author's preferred text, never before published in the UK, and is about 12,000 words longer than the previous UK edition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>With the Cinnamon Roll Six jazz band heading toward Lake Eden for the Weekend Jazz Festival, Hannah Swensen is more than happy to bake up a generous supply of their namesake confections. But tragedy strikes when the band's tour bus overturns on its way into town. Among those injured is Buddy Neiman, the band's beloved keyboard player. At first, Buddy's injuries appear minor, until his condition suddenly takes a turn for the worse, as in dead. Hannah's no doctor, but she suspects that the surgical scissor jutting out of Buddy's chest may have something to do with it.</description>

  <description>These days, everyone in Lake Eden, Minnesota, is buzzing with activity, and Hannah Swensen is no exception. But no matter how busy she may be, Hannah can always find time to help a friend in need--especially when he's been murdered. . .&lt;p&gt;Hannah Swensen has to admit that her life is pretty sweet. Things are going well in the romance department, and her bakery's delectable confections are selling almost as fast as she can bake them. Even her good friend Claire is on Cloud Nine, head over heels with her new husband, Reverend Bob Knudson. If only they could find time to take their honeymoon! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bob's childhood friend, Matthew Walters, comes to town, it seems like divine intervention. Matthew, like Bob, is a Lutheran minister with a stubborn sweet tooth. Since he's on sabbatical, Matthew is happy to fill in for Bob while he and Claire take that long-awaited honeymoon. It sounds like the perfect plan--until Hannah finds Matthew in the rectory, face-down in a plate full of Devil's Food Cake, a single bullet in his head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to find out who killed Matthew, Hannah starts asking questions--and discovers that the good Reverend wasn't quite the saintly fellow he appeared to be. But could the gold Sacagawea coins in Sunday's collection plate hold the key to solving the crime? Or is the murder connected to that big jewel heist out in Minneapolis? Is it possible that Matthew's love of chocolate somehow led to his downfall? It will take some more digging to find out, but Hannah is sure of one thing: even the most half-baked murder plot can be oh so deadly. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Early summer brings plenty of work for baker Hannah Swensen, even before Mayor Bascomb's wife drops by The Cookie Jar to place an order for her charity event...For eleven-hundred cookies! And Hannah almost flips when her business partner, Lisa, suggests setting up an apple turnover stand. But she places her faith in Lisa and agrees to be a magician's assistant in the fundraiser's talent show. The only snag is the show's host, college professor Bradford Ramsey. Hannah and her sister, Michelle, each had unfortunate romances with Ramsey, and when the cad comes sniffing around between acts, Hannah tells him off. But when the curtain doesn't go up, she discovers Ramsey backstage - dead, with a turnover in his hand. Now Hannah must find a killer who's flakier than puff pastry - and far more dangerous.</description>

  <description>Holiday business is booming at Hannah Swenson's Cookie Jar pastry shop, but the mysterious murder of "Lunatic Larry" Jaeger puts a serious crimp in the season of good cheer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the looks of it, Larry had as many enemies as Hannah's sugar cookies have sprinkles. With the 12 days of Christmas ticking down and cookie orders piling up, tracking down the killer won't be easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clever whodunit with pastry recipe dividends.</description>

  <description>Summertime has finally arrived in Lake Eden, Minnesota, and Hannah Swensen, owner of The Cookie Jar bakery, is looking forward to warm, lazy days, eating ice cream, and sharing picnics with friends. But when a family reunion takes a deadly turn, it's up to Hannah to find a killer...Between baking up a storm for The Cookie Jar and unravelling the mystery of her cat Moishe's recent strange behaviour, Hannah Swensen has a lot on her plate. But she'll always make time for her business partner, Lisa, who's in the midst of preparing for a big family reunion. Everyone is delighted when Lisa's long-lost uncle makes a surprise appearance. No one has heard from Gus in twenty-five years - and his arrival has everyone buzzing with excitement.Uncle Gus is immediately the hit of the reunion, telling tales of his great success and flashing money for all to see. He's almost as popular as Hannah's scrumptious carrot cake, which is also Gus' favourite dessert. But the next morning, as the whole family gathers for the group photo, one person is missing. Hannah offers to track down Uncle Gus, but her search leads to a shocking find. Over by the bar at the pavilion, she spots two slices of her infamous carrot cake, frosting-side down on the floor - and Gus' corpse with an ice pick jutting out of his chest!A little snooping reveals that not everyone was celebrating Gus' return. And when Hannah unearths more secrets from Gus' past, she discovers even more people with an axe to grind. Now Hannah's got to sift through a long list of suspects to find a killer - even if it could mean a recipe for her own demise...</description>

  <description>When it comes to holidays, Minnesotans rise to the occasion—and the little town of Lake Eden is baking up a storm with Hannah Swensen leading the way. The annual Christmas Buffet is the final test of the recipes Hannah has collected for the &lt;i&gt;Lake Eden Holiday Buffet Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recently divorced Martin Dubinski arrives at the buffet with his new Vegas showgirl wife—all wrapped up in glitter and fur. His ex-wife, however, seems as cool as chilled eggnog. And when Hannah’s mother’s antique Christmas cake knife disappears, its discovery in the décolletage of the new—and now late—Mrs. Dubinski puts the festivities on ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everyone stranded at the community center by a blizzard, Hannah puts her investigative skills to the test, using the ingredients at hand: half the town of Lake Eden—and a killer. Now, as the snowdrifts get higher, it’s up to Hannah to dig out all the clues—and make sure that this white Christmas doesn’t bring any more deadly tidings…</description>

  <description>Bakery owner Hannah Swensen just can't keep her hands out of the batter when murder stirs things up in Lake Eden, Minnesota, leaving the sheriff dead, an innocent deputy accused, and a killer still on the loose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Hannah, life seems to be lacking a certain flavor. It's not that she doesn't enjoy teaching a weekly "Potluck Cooking Class" at the community outreach center. Or that she's not excited about her sister Andrea's bun in the oven -- watching the very pregnant Andrea try to sit on a stool at The Cookie Jar is worth it every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's this year's sheriff's election that's got her down. For years, Sheriff Grant's been the iron hand in town. But now, Hannah's brother-in-law Bill is giving the old blowhard the fight of his long, dubious career -- and Grant's not taking it in stride, especially once the local polls (and The Cookie Jar gossip) show Bill pulling ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before anyone can get a taste of victory, things go sour. Just as Hannah's emptying the trash, she makes a very unappetizing discovery: Sheriff Grant's body in the dumpster behind the high school where she's teaching her cooking class. And if that weren't bad enough, the poor man still has fudge frosting on his shirt from the cupcake she gave him earlier. She'd been trying to find the secret ingredient left out of the recipe. Now she has a more important mystery to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one suspect is none other than Bill. In fact, he's the only suspect. But Hannah's not swallowing it. Plenty of people had reason to hate Sheriff Grant, starting with all the deputies whose cases he stole during election years just so he could take the glory. Soon, Hannah's dishing up scandalous secrets, steaming hot betrayals, and enough nastiness to keep the gossip mill at The Cookie Jar going through several pots of decaf. And the closer Hannah gets to the truth, the closer she gets to smoking out a murderer with a very nasty recipe for silencing people. Will Hannah be able to stand the heat when someone wants her out of the kitchen... for good?</description>

  <description>Hannah Swensen thought she'd finally discovered the recipe for a perfect life. But her sometime beau Norman Rhodes tosses a surprise ingredient into the mix when he phones to tell her he's just bought a house from local drugstore clerk Rhonda Scharf - which he plans to tear down in order to build the dream home he and Hannah designed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the plan has been cooking for quite some time, and Hannah is shocked - especially since her ring finger is still very much bare. The good news is that the soon-to-be-torn-down house is full of antiques - and Norman has given Hannah and her mother first dibs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They uncover some gorgeous old furniture, a patchwork quilt ... and Rhonda Scharf's dead body. A little more sleuthing turns up the half-eaten remains of a very special dinner for two - and one of The Cookie Jar's famous lemon meringue pies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's up to Hannah to turn up the heat - and get busy tracking down the clues. Starting in her very own kitchen.</description>

  <description>Preparations are underway for Lake Eden, Minnesota's annual Winter Carnival--and Hannah Swensen is set to bake up a storm at her popular shop, The Cookie Jar. Too bad the honor of creating the official Winter Carnival cake went to famous lifestyle maven Connie Mac--a half-baked idea, in Hannah's opinion. She suspects Connie Mac is a lot like the confections she whips up on her cable TV cooking show--sweet, light, and scrumptious-looking, but likely to leave a bitter taste in your mouth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah's suspicions are confirmed when Connie Mac's limo rolls into town. Turns out America's "Cooking Sweetheart" is bossy, bad-tempered, and downright domineering. Things finally boil over when Hannah arrives at The Cookie Jar to find the Winter Carnival cake burnt to a crisp—and Connie Mac lying dead in her pantry, struck down while eating one of Hannah's famous blueberry muffins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing Hannah knows, the police have declared The Cookie Jar's kitchen crime scene off-limits. She's a baker without an oven--and the Carnival is right around the corner. Hannah's only alternative is to cook up a plan to save her business--by finding the killer herself...</description>

  <description>When the president of Hartland Flour chooses cozy Lake Eden, Minnesota, as the spot for their first annual Dessert Bake-Off, Hannah is thrilled to serve as the head judge. But when a fellow judge, Coach Boyd Watson, is found stone-cold dead, facedown in Hannah’s celebrated strawberry shortcake, Lake Eden’s sweet ride to fame turns very sour indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between perfecting her Cheddar Cheese Apple Pie and Chocolate Crunchies, Hannah’s snooping into the coach’s private life and not coming up short on suspects. And could Watson’s harsh criticism during the judging have given one of the contestants a license to kill? The stakes are rising faster than dough, and Hannah will have to be very careful, because somebody is cooking up a recipe for murder…with Hannah landing on the “necessary ingredients” list.</description>

  <description>Discover the delicious mystery that started it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one cooks up a delectable, suspense-filled mystery quite like Hannah Swensen, Joanne Fluke's dessert-baking, red-haired heroine whose gingersnaps are as tart as her comebacks, and whose penchant for solving crimes one delicious clue at a time has made her a bestselling favorite. And it all began on these pages, with a bakery, a murder, and some suddenly scandalous chocolate-chip crunchies. Featuring a bonus short story and brand new, mouthwatering recipes, this limited edition of the very first Hannah Swensen mystery is sure to have readers coming back for seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Swenson already has her hands full trying to dodge her mother's attempts to marry her off while running The Cookie Jar, Lake Eden, Minnesota's most popular bakery. But once Ron LaSalle, the beloved delivery man from the Cozy Cow Dairy, is found murdered behind her bakery with Hannah's famous Chocolate Chip Crunchies scattered around him, her life just can't get any worse. Determined not to let her cookies get a bad reputation, she sets out to track down a killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would have the sheer audacity and the motive to kill the most punctual delivery man Hannah ever had? Topping the list is the high school football coach. What exactly was his wife doing, making the rounds with the milkman? Could Max Turner, owner of Cozy Cow Dairy, have had a secret he didn't want to share with his top employee? The more Hannah snoops, the more suspects turn up. Why has Lake Eden's most prominent prodigal son, Benton Woodley, just resurfaced? And what about the mysterious Mr. Harris who seemed interested in buying the property next to the dairy, but then disappeared? This is one murder that's starting to leave a very bad taste in Hannah's mouth. And if she doesn't watch her back, Hannah's sweet life may get burned to a crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with a healthy sprinkling of humor and a delightful assortment of nuts, &lt;i&gt;CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE MURDER&lt;/i&gt; serves up a great new mystery series and introduces a delicious, down-home sleuth that mystery readers will surely savor for years to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the latest installment of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Charlaine Harris's Aurora Teagarden series, Robin and Aurora have finally begun their adventure in parenting. With newborn Sophie proving to be quite a handful, Roe's mother pays for a partially trained nurse, Virginia Mitchell, to come help the new parents for a few weeks. Virginia proves to be especially helpful when Robin has to leave town for work and Roe is struck with a bad case of the flu.&lt;br /&gt;One particularly stormy night, Roe wakes to hear her daughter crying and Virginia nowhere to be found. Roe's brother Philip helps her search the house and they happen upon a body outside... but it isn't Virginia's. Now, not only does she have a newborn to care for and a vulnerable new marriage to nurture, Roe also has to contend with a new puzzle - who is this mystery woman dead in their backyard, and what happened to Virginia? This heart-pounding and exciting next installment of the Aurora Teagarden series will leave fans happy and hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Is the truth hiding in plain sight? That is the question at the heart of All the Little Liars, the latest installment of Charlaine Harris's fan-favorite Aurora Teagarden mystery series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurora Teagarden is basking in her new pregnancy when disaster strikes her small Georgia town: four kids have gone missing from school--and her teenage brother, Phillip, is one of them. While the local police comb the county for clues, Aurora and her new husband, bestselling writer Robin Crusoe, begin their own investigation. Is Phillip's disappearance related to Aurora's father's gambling debts? Or is Phillip himself, new to town and an unknown quantity, responsible for taking the other children? As days go by, it's up to Aurora to find the answers to these disturbing questions before it's too late for the missing--and she herself ends up in harm's way. . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome back to the sleepy little town of&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Arkansas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, where secrets come to hide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning woman and karate expert Lily Bard is a woman with a complicated past. Trying her best to cope with her terrifying memories and horrible nightmares, she decides to join a weekly group therapy session in her hometown of Shakespeare, Arkansas. At first, Lily can hardly believe the number of her fellow Shakespeareans that share her life experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, the group members' feelings aren't the only things that need sorting out -- they assemble for a session and find a woman dead, killed in bone-chilling fashion and deliberately left on display to send a twisted message. Who would commit such horrendous crime, and who is the intended recipient of the message?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Lily becomes embroiled in this disturbing murder and its aftermath, one in which the brutal killer's motives are entirely unclear. The truth is, the situation has dredged up more than a few of her own terrible secrets, and she may not be able to rest until she can untangle the who and why of this terrible crime. But can she accomplish this before the killer strikes again, and before her nightmares send her over the edge? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Aurora Teagarden has never forgotten her first case: a serial killer who terrorized suburban Lawrencetown. Now that story is about to hit the small screen. Even if she wanted to, Aurora can't help getting involved. Her ex, Robin, wrote the TV movie's screenplay and her stepson, Barrett, has a starring role. Then there's Celia--the catty actress portraying Roe--who, by the way, also happens to be Robin's latest squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Celia is murdered and Barrett is accused, the real-life script takes a deadly turn. Between threatening letters, deranged fans and renewed feelings for Robin, Aurora has one goal: catch a killer and make it to the final scene alive.</description>

  <description>Even in a sleepy Arkansas town, the holidays can be murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily Bard is going home for the holidays. More comfortable in baggy sweats than bridesmaid's frills, Lily isn't thrilled about attending her estranged sister's wedding. She has moved to Shakespeare, Arkansas, to start a new life, cleaning houses for a living, trying to forget the violence that once nearly destroyed her. Now she's heading back to home and hearth--just in time for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town's doctor and nurse have been bludgeoned to death at the office. And Lily's detective boyfriend suddenly shows up at her parents' door. Jack Leeds is investigating an eight-year-old kidnapping and the trail leads straight to Lily's hometown. It just might have something to do with the murders...and her sister's widowed fiancé. With only three days before the wedding, Lily must work fast to clean up the messy case before her sister commits...marriage!</description>

  <description>Aurora Teagarden, mild-mannered librarian, has spent her entire life in the same small Georgia town. Along with her sister-in-law Poppy, Roe has finally earned a coveted spot in the Uppity Women, an exclusive group that does more than flower arranging. But Poppy is a no-show on their induction day. Roe stops by Poppy’s house to find out why and is shocked to discover Poppy dead on the kitchen floor, and it’s not by accident. There’s no lack of suspects, since both Poppy and her husband were unfaithful. Even the detective in charge of the case, Roe’s former lover Arthur Smith, has a past with Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that weren’t enough, Roe has rekindled a relationship with another old flame and things are moving fast, with plans to meet his mother at Thanksgiving. She’s also acquired an unexpected house guest: her half-brother, who’s run away from his parents’ home in California. Balancing her personal life while looking into Poppy’s murder isn’t easy, but Roe is determined to give it -- and Poppy -- her best effort. And when Roe discovers that the crime scene has been ransacked, she knows someone is desperate to hide a secret. Roe will have to dig through Poppy’s life to uncover the truth and bring the killer to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Done to Death is the engaging eighth installment of the Aurora Teagarden mysteries by #1 New York Times bestselling author Charlaine Harris. The series has been adapted into film for Hallmark Movies &amp;amp; Mysteries.</description>

  <description>Welcome back to Shakespeare -- a charming Arkansas town with endless back roads, an eclectic mix of residents, and a dollop of noir. Featuring cleaning woman/karate expert Lily Bard, Charlaine Harris's series puts a unique spin on the traditional cozy to create mysteries that "work on every level". — In the latest installment, Lily discovers lifelong Shakespeare resident Deedra Dean murdered inside a car parked in a woodsy area outside town. Determined not to get involved, Lily wants to leave the police work to Sheriff Marta Schuster and her team of deputies, and concentrate on cleaning, high kicks, and her boyfriend Jack's impending visit. But when Deedra's notoriously promiscuous lifestyle provides an extensive list of suspects but very few clues, Lily has no choice but to resume the roll of amateur detective and join the investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fourth book in Charlaine Harris's highly acclaimed and darkly compelling series, Lily Bard delivers a hard-hitting mix of Southern charm and street smarts, a combination so alluring that long-time readers and newcomers will be dying to visit Shakespeare again. &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>There's something rotten in Shakespeare... — Lily Bard was running from shattering memories when she moved to Shakespeare, Arkansas. Now cleaning houses pays her bills. Working out helps her heal. Still protecting her scars, she hides a hard body and impressive skill at martial arts under baggy sweats. And nobody knows how strong she is until racial violence has her looking behind closed doors for a killer -- doors to which a housecleaner might have the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lily uses her training in goju to help a black man jumped by white teens, she does it for justice...only to hear he's been abducted and beaten to death a few weeks later. Then a bodybuilder is killed at her gym. Both incidents jar Lily's need for security and refuge. Looking into closets, sweeping under rugs, she soon uncovers enough dirt to confirm that something sinister is growing in her adopted town. Getting involved could endanger her life. But Lily is seeing a new man and dreaming new dreams. And no one can make this strong woman run again.</description>

  <description>What's the world coming to - when you can't relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden? Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department's finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe's friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe's feet. Roe's husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It's only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe's yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.</description>

  <description>Since she met her fiance Martin Bartell, Roe Teagarden has never been happier. There's a difference in age and in background, but he seems to know exactly what she wants - like the Julius house. Roe is thrilled when Martin gives her the house as a wedding present. She's a keen amateur sleuth, and she has always been intrigued by its infamous history: six years ago, the family who lived there disappeared, never to be seen again. As Roe throws herself into renovating the Julius house, her misgivings about Martin's rather murky past recede. But when Roe is attacked by an axe-wielding maniac, she realises that the secrets inside her four walls - and her brand-new marriage - could destroy her.</description>

  <description>Deciding if she wants to go into real estate becomes a life-or-death choice for Aurora "Roe" Teagarden. A naked corpse is discovered at her first house showing. And when a second body is found in another house for sale, it becomes obvious that there is a very cool killer at large in Lawrenceton, one who knows a great deal about real estate-and maybe too much about Roe.</description>

  <description>Going to two weddings—one of a former lover—and a funeral for a member of her disbanded crime study club keeps Aurora “Roe” Teagarden quite busy for a few months. Unfortunately, her personal life seems to be at a standstill—until her fortunes unexpectedly change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the funeral, Roe learns that Jane Engle, the deceased, has named her as heir to a rather substantial estate, which includes money, jewelry, and a house complete with a skull hidden in a window seat. Knowing Jane, Roe concludes that the elderly woman has purposely left her a murder to solve. So she must identify the victim and figure out which one of Jane’s ordinary-seeming neighbors is a murderer—without putting herself in deadly danger...</description>

  <description>Welcome to Shakespeare, Arkansas. Lily Bard came to the small town of Shakespeare to escape her dark and violent past. Other than the day-to-day workings of her cleaning and errand-running service, she pays little attention to the town around her. So when she spots a dead body being dumped in the town green, she's inclined to stay well away. But she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and despite her best efforts, she's dragged into the murder case. Lily doesn't care who did it, but when the police and local community start pointing fingers in her direction, she realizes that proving her innocence will depend on finding the real killer in quiet, secretive Shakespeare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shakespeare's Landlord &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in Charlaine Harris's Lily Bard mysterious series.</description>

  <description>Though a small town at heart, Lawrenceton, Georgia, has its dark side-and crime buffs. One of whom is librarian Aurora "Roe" Teagarden, a member of the Real Murders Club, which meets once a month to analyze famous cases. It's a harmless pastime—until the night she finds a member killed in a manner that eerily resembles the crime the club was about to discuss. And as other brutal "copycat" killings follow, Roe will have to uncover the person behind the terrifying game, one that casts all the members of Real Murders, herself included, as prime suspects-or potential victims.</description>

  <description>Hired to find a boy gene missing in Doraville, North Carolina, Harper Connelly and her brother Tolliver head there, only to discover that the boy was the only one left of several who had disappeared over the previous five years. All of them teenagers. All unlikely runaways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All calling for Harper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Harper soon finds them—eight victims, buried in the half-frozen ground, all come to an unspeakable end. Afterward, what she most wants to do is collect her fee and get out of town ahead of the media storm that's soon to descend. But when she's attacked and prevented from leaving, she reluctantly becomes a part of the investigation as she learns more than she cares to about the dark mysteries and long-hidden secrets of Doraville—knowledge that makes her the next person likely to rest in an ice-cold grave.</description>

  <description>Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper Connelly has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.</description>

  <description>Twenty-two-year-old Aern is done watching his brother destroy the only thing that matters. He never wanted to take Morgan’s place among council, never wanted to rule their hidden world. But when the key to the prophecy is found, a young girl named Brianna whom Morgan will destroy, Aern knows he has to take action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he really wants, is for things to go back to normal. But now he’s kidnapped a girl, and his brother’s men are after him. His only hope is to join with the Division, but they have plans of their own, and it’s the last thing Aern is willing to do.&lt;br /&gt;Emily just wants her sister back. She doesn't care about the prophecy, or realize what’s at stake. But when she goes after Aern, the truth of the matter uncoils, and Brianna isn't the only one who’s in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, they’re at the center of a secret war, and unless they can work together, they’ll both have a sacrifice too big to make.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;War is coming for the dragon knights…but love may find them first.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A chance meeting with a young male dragon seals the fate of one adventurous female poacher. The dragon’s partner, a ruggedly handsome knight named Gareth, takes one look at the shapely woman and decides to do a little poaching of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sir Gareth both seduces and falls deeply in love with the girl who is not only unafraid of dragons but also possesses a rare gift—she can hear the beasts’ silent speech. He wants her for his mate, but mating with a knight is no simple thing. To accept a knight, a woman must also accept the dragon, the dragon’s mate…and her knight, Lars, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She is at first shocked, then intrigued by the lusty life in the Lair. But war is in the making and only the knights and dragons have a chance at ending it before it destroys their land and their lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Contains dragons, their sexy knights and a damsel who is not quite in distress. Sizzling hot m/f/m scenes may leave you breathing fire.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Dragon Knights series consists of: &lt;br /&gt;1. Maiden Flight &lt;br /&gt;1.5. The Dragon Healer (novella) &lt;br /&gt;2. Border Lair &lt;br /&gt;2.5. Master at Arms (novella) &lt;br /&gt;3. The Ice Dragon &lt;br /&gt;4.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Three Paranormal Romance Stories&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Awakened&lt;/b&gt; by Brenda K. Davies &lt;br /&gt;Traumatized by her past, and struggling to move on from it, Sera has spent the past three years of college hiding herself from the world and content to stay that way. A chance encounter with Liam shatters her sheltered world, leaving her stunned and shaken by the strange feelings and emotions he arises in her, feelings she never thought she would experience and that frighten her in their intensity. Harboring a dark and deadly secret of his own, Liam knows that he should stay away from Sera; that he will only bring her more hurt, but he is irresistibly drawn to her and unable to deny himself the pleasure that only she can bring to him. But when their pasts collide with their present, and Liam’s true nature is revealed, will their love for each other be enough, or will they be torn apart forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blur&lt;/b&gt; by Kristen Middleton &lt;br /&gt;Seventeen year old Nikki and her twin brother, Nathan, move to the small town of Shore Lake to start over after their mother is brutally attacked. When a missing teenager washes up on shore during their first night at the cabin and there are whispers of vampires in Shore Lake, Nikki begins to realize that there are things roaming in the darkness that are far more sinister than what they left behind in the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning&lt;/b&gt;- This book contains some language, violence, and sexual situations recommended for ages seventeen and older.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blood's Fury&lt;/b&gt; by C.M. Owens &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The deadliest things in life are often the most beautiful… seconds before they strike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her immortal destiny quickly encroaching, Alyssa Coldwell wants to play human while she still has a chance. Unfortunately, she chooses the wrong town to escape her true world.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful masks are worn by the enemies she doesn’t know, and no one can ever be trusted—and Pine Shore is full of beautiful masks. The ones who are the most deceptive in appearance are usually the deadliest, but their camouflage can fool the eyes. &lt;br /&gt;Kane Ice is nothing more than deliciously forbidden, but she can’t help herself from falling. She knows it can’t last, because he’s human and she only has a limited amount of time left before she’s something else entirely, but that doesn’t stop her from giving him all she can while she can. &lt;br /&gt;But surviving until her change isn’t as easy as she thought it would be, and now she has accidentally pulled her beautiful human into a deadly game of cat and mouse that she doesn’t want to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood’s Fury is book one of the bestselling Trilogy, Deadly Beauties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Due to sexual content and use of language, this trilogy is not recommended to anyone under the age of 17.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs. It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow-impossible though it seems-they may still be alive. A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.</description>

  <description>In this grown-up version of the famous fairy tale, Princess Adara is running from her old life and a forced betrothal. Adara wants love and passion, but knows she can't get them back home. When a raging storm halts her escape, Adara seeks refuge in the first dwelling she sees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Richard is tired of the trite, vain, frigid princesses his mother introduces him to in hopes he'll marry. On this stormy night, he's in the mood to love a woman, but he's all alone. Then, Adara arrives on the castle doorstep, saying she's a princess in need of help. The queen is doubtful and decides to lock Adara in a room with a pea to determine if the girl is a real princess. Richard believes the beautiful, charming stranger, but he wants her locked in a bedroom for other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Richard and Adara hook up, there's more than a pea-sized bit of passion involved....</description>

  <description>After struggling with his weight for 17 years, hungry and lazy man George del Prado was intimately familiar with the ups and downs of yo-yo dieting. His last time down, however, was his last time down. How did he finally get to his ideal weight and keep it off? By embracing the hunger and laziness in all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George created a diet and exercise plan that focuses on both effectiveness and sustainability. Why take advice from people who have been healthy and fit all their lives when you can learn from someone who walked the same frustrating path as you, only to find the way out? With a personal, humorous, and conversational writing style, The Hungry and Lazy Guide offers motivation, common-sense advice, and finally, a fitness plan you can live with.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the wildly successful Wolf Tales series and the DemonSlayers series comes the first short in the &lt;i&gt;Demon Lovers&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie Logan simply stopped to do the right thing. While helping an injured woman in the park, she becomes the victim of a vicious attack and barely makes it home to tend her own wounds. Later that night, tired and feverish, Addie awakens to find two gorgeous men standing over her bedside. Unsure if they are real or a figment of her imagination, she reaches out and unleashes an erotic hunger like none she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcoming the men into her bed, Addie experiences pleasures she’s never felt and finds herself becoming very attached to the strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these men need more from her than just erotic pleasure. They are demon hunters, and the attack on Addie in the park has made her one of them. Entering a world she never knew existed, Addie now dedicates her life to fighting demons and enjoying the pleasures of the two gorgeous men she fights alongside and is coming to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bonus! This edition includes an excerpt from Dream Bound, the first book in the new Dream Catchers series, and from CrystalFire, the fourth book in the DemonSlayers series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>EPISODE ONE - Where Felicia learns that Pixies may be able to cure her vampirism, if she’s willing to pay the price. If you like magical quests and sex in the snowy dark of night, then read on…&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;- - - - - -&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Felicia is a vampire. Serious, sexy… and maybe even suicidal. She finds her need to feed on the life of others abhorrent, but is the victim of her own desires.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Mint is a Pixie. Whimsical, cute… and, like all Pixies, has a single-minded need for sexual pleasure.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Pixies: they just might be the solution to Felicia’s problem… as long as she doesn’t mind replacing one addiction for another.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;- - - - - -&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;“Pixie Chix — Tales of a Lesbian Vampire” is on ongoing series, slated for a ten episode run. It takes place in the same world as the “Tales of Sex and Magic” series and shares a similar set of ingredients: sex, magic and a hint of silliness.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;WARNING: this story contains explicit descriptions of lesbian sex and more than its fair share of naughty language.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Stranded far from home, can Sade Hughes accept the developing erotic bond between her and the fugitive elven prince, Aranion, a bond that promises to take Sade to the heights of sexual pleasure even as Aranion's secrets threaten to destroy the both? And will their fragile relationship survive Sade's first introduction to the elven king? &lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sade Hughes needs to get out of the city for a while. Her crazy, drug-dealing ex-lover wants her back, and he's promised to find her, one way or the other. But when Sade takes refuge in the sprawling country farmhouse she inherited from her grandmother, things go from bad to worse as a seductive elf from her childhood dreams comes face to face with the nightmare of her city past. Now, stranded far from home, can Sade accept the developing erotic bond between her and the fugitive elven prince, Aranion, a bond that promises to take Sade to the heights of sexual pleasure even as Aranion's secrets threaten to destroy the both? And will their fragile relationship survive Sade's first introduction to the elven king? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part one of a three-part serialized Fantasy Erotic Romance. This part has a length of about 20,000 words. It contains strong sexual content and is &lt;b&gt;not intended for readers under 18. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sydney soon becomes the target of the killer and ends up fighting for her life and love in the Big Easy.

  <description>The breakout star of this summer's blockbuster Avengers film, Clint Barton - aka the self-made hero Hawkeye - fights for justice! With ex-Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he's out to prove himself as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes! SHIELD recruits Clint to intercept a packet of incriminating evidence - before he becomes the most wanted man in the world. You won't believe what is on The Tape! What is the Vagabond Code? Matt Fraction pens a Hawkeye thriller that spans the globe...and the darkest parts of Hawkeye's mind. Barton and Bishop mean double the Hawkeye and double the trouble...and stealing from the rich never looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Hawkeye&lt;i&gt; 1-5, &lt;i&gt;Young Avengers Presents&lt;/i&gt; 6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the third installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series The Mortal Instruments.</description>

  <description>Reeling from recent events, even Hawkeye wants to know his new status quo. Who’s with him? Who’s against him? Who’s trying to kill him, and why? And just when Clint’s rock bottom couldn’t arrive fast enough, his brother shows up. After a lifetime of bad decisions, Clint and Barney Barton have to realize they have to save one another — If they don’t kill each other first. But when Clown and the Tracksuit Draculas lay siege to their building, round one doesn't go well. Deafened and bloodied, will the Bartons make easy pickings for the Tracksuits? Ever seen Rio Bravo? The brothers Barton double down in a new kind of shoot 'em up! Don't miss it bro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Collecting: Hawkeye #12-13, 15, 17, 19, 21-22&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Furiously Happy, a humor memoir tinged with just enough tragedy and pathos to make it worthwhile, Jenny Lawson examines her own experience with severe depression and a host of other conditions, and explains how it has led her to live life to the fullest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I've often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that ‘normal people' also might never understand. And that's what Furiously Happy is all about."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny’s readings are standing room only, with fans lining up to have Jenny sign their bottles of Xanax or Prozac as often as they are to have her sign their books. Furiously Happy appeals to Jenny's core fan base but also transcends it. There are so many people out there struggling with depression and mental illness, either themselves or someone in their family—and in Furiously Happy they will find a member of their tribe offering up an uplifting message (via a taxidermied roadkill raccoon). Let's Pretend This Never Happened ostensibly was about embracing your own weirdness, but deep down it was about family. Furiously Happy is about depression and mental illness, but deep down it's about joy—and who doesn't want a bit more of that?</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Why Not Me?&lt;/i&gt;, Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it’s falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you’re constantly reminded that no one looks like you.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In “How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet’s Confessions,” Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, (“Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn’t the land of appropriate–this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman’s traditional hair color is honey blonde.”) “Player” tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (“I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.”) In “Unlikely Leading Lady,” she muses on America’s fixation with the weight of actresses, (“Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they’re walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.”) And in “Soup Snakes,” Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak (“I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.”)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who’s ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who’ve never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.</description>

  <description>For fans of Tina Fey and David Sedaris—Internet star Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess, makes her literary debut.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Jenny Lawson realized that the most mortifying moments of our lives—the ones we’d like to pretend never happened—are in fact the ones that define us. In the #1 N&lt;i&gt;ew York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Let’s Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/i&gt;, Lawson takes readers on a hilarious journey recalling her bizarre upbringing in rural Texas, her devastatingly awkward high school years, and her relationship with her long-suffering husband, Victor. Chapters include: “Stanley the Magical, Talking Squirrel”; “A Series of Angry Post-It Notes to My Husband”; “My Vagina Is Fine. Thanks for Asking”; “And Then I Snuck a Dead Cuban Alligator on an Airplane.” Pictures with captions (no one would believe these things without proof) accompany the text.</description>

  <description>Rock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of &lt;i&gt;The Art Of Asking&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. &lt;i&gt;The Art Of Asking&lt;/i&gt; will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love.</description>

  <description>Arthur Penhaligon's first days at his new school don't go too well, particularly when a fiendish Mister Monday appears, gives Arthur a magical clock hand, and then orders his gang of dog-faced goons to chase Arthur around and get it back. But when the confused and curious boy discovers that a mysterious virus is spreading through town, he decides to enter an otherworldly house to stop it. After meeting Suzy Blue and the first part of "the Will" (a frog-looking entity that knows everything about the House), Arthur learns that he's been selected as Rightful Heir to the House and must get the other part of the clock hand in order to defeat Monday. That means getting past Monday's henchmen and journeying to the Dayroom itself. Thankfully, Arthur is up to the challenge, but as he finds out, his fight seems to be only one-seventh over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a weapon-wielding hero and a villain who doesn't make Mondays any nicer, Nix's Keys to the Kingdom launch is imaginative and gripping. After an action-packed crescendo to the book's middle -- when Arthur finally learns his destiny -- Nix keeps the drama going and doesn't let it fall. By the end, you might be winded from all the fantastic explanation, but you'll definitely be salivating for what's to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nico had warned them.&lt;/b&gt; Going through the House of Hades would stir the demigods' worst memories. Their ghosts would become restless. Nico may actually &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; a ghost if he has to shadow-travel with Reyna and Coach Hedge one more time. But that might be better than the alternative: allowing someone else to die, as Hades foretold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason's ghost is his mother,&lt;/b&gt; who abandoned him when he was little. He may not know how he is going to prove himself as a leader, but he does know that he will not break promises like she did. He will complete his line of the prophecy: &lt;i&gt;To storm or fire the world must fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reyna fears the ghosts of her ancestors,&lt;/b&gt; who radiate anger. But she can't allow them to distract her from getting the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood before war breaks out between the Romans and Greeks. Will she have enough strength to succeed, especially with a deadly hunter on her trail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leo fears that his plan won't work,&lt;/b&gt; that his friends might interfere. But there is no other way. All of them know that one of the Seven has to die in order to defeat Gaea, the Earth Mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Piper must learn to give herself over to fear.&lt;/b&gt; Only then will she be able to do her part at the end: utter a single word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heroes, gods, and monsters all have a role to play in the climactic fulfillment of the prophecy in &lt;i&gt;The Blood of Olympus&lt;/i&gt;, the electrifying finale of the best-selling Heroes of Olympus series.</description>

  <description>In the magical underworld of Victorian London, Tessa Gray has at last found safety with the Shadowhunters. But that safety proves fleeting when rogue forces in the Clave plot to see her protector, Charlotte, replaced as head of the Institute. If Charlotte loses her position, Tessa will be out on the street—and easy prey for the mysterious Magister, who wants to use Tessa’s powers for his own dark ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of the handsome, self-destructive Will and the fiercely devoted Jem, Tessa discovers that the Magister’s war on the Shadowhunters is deeply personal. He blames them for a long-ago tragedy that shattered his life. To unravel the secrets of the past, the trio journeys from mist-shrouded Yorkshire to a manor house that holds untold horrors, from the slums of London to an enchanted ballroom where Tessa discovers that the truth of her parentage is more sinister than she had imagined. When they encounter a clockwork demon bearing a warning for Will, they realize that the Magister himself knows their every move—and that one of their own has betrayed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa finds her heart drawn more and more to Jem, but her longing for Will, despite his dark moods, continues to unsettle her. But something is changing in Will—the wall he has built around himself is crumbling. Could finding the Magister free Will from his secrets and give Tessa the answers about who she is and what she was born to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their dangerous search for the Magister and the truth leads the friends into peril, Tessa learns that when love and lies are mixed, they can corrupt even the purest heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place.&lt;/b&gt; The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

And when it comes to girls named Katherine, Colin is always getting dumped. Nineteen times, to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a road trip miles from home, this anagram-happy, washed-up child prodigy has ten thousand dollars in his pocket, a bloodthirsty feral hog on his trail, and an overweight, Judge Judy-loving best friend riding shotgun--but no Katherines. Colin is on a mission to prove The Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability, which he hopes will predict the future of any relationship, avenge Dumpees everywhere, and finally win him the girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, friendship, and a dead Austro-Hungarian archduke add up to surprising and heart-changing conclusions in this ingeniously layered comic novel about reinventing oneself.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love John Green's storytelling. he really connects to the world of that young adult. the expanse, the questions. this book was amazing in how it let's the reader escape and how it makes the reader question. every character was adorable, lovable, and hate worthy.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Before.&lt;/b&gt; Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;After.&lt;/b&gt; Nothing is ever the same.</description>

In fact, it’s not uncommon for grieving people to experience depression, anxiety, fatigue, and a variety of other physical, mental, and spiritual symptoms. If you’ve tried other ways to move beyond your loss but have yet to find relief, you may be surprised to discover the transformative effects of yoga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoga for Grief Relief &lt;/em&gt;combines over 100 illustrations of gentle yogic poses and the power of psychophysiology and neuroscience to help you recapture a true sense of well-being. You’ll also find breathing exercises, cleansing techniques, and self-relaxation tips to help you work through your loss and begin on the journey to self-knowledge and re-identification. At its core, yoga is about accepting change. If you are open to viewing your loss as an opportunity for growth, this book will help transform your grief with gentle clarity and awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out more, visit yogaforgriefrelief.com</description>

  <description>Written from the unique experiences of Doug Pedersen, this self-improvement book--disguised as a memoir--is at once funny, poignant, and generous, while offering genuine advice. Providing intimate insights into being a "super fat kid," an insecure teenager, and an over-aggressive, angry, and ironically arrogant Marine who was full of self-pity, Doug shares the negative emotional drivers and responses that drove him through a "binge eating life" before finding physical health, emotional balance, and spiritual wholeness. Tuna Breath invites us to intimately observe a troubling life journey in which the lessons to be learned are truly visceral and inspirational.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A look at the emotional side of medicine—the shame, fear, anger, anxiety, empathy, and even love that affect patient care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physicians are assumed to be objective, rational beings, easily able to detach as they guide patients and families through some of life’s most challenging moments. But doctors’ emotional responses to the life-and-death dramas of everyday practice have a profound impact on medical care. And while much has been written about the minds and methods of the medical professionals who save our lives, precious little has been said about their emotions. In &lt;i&gt;What Doctors Feel&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Danielle Ofri has taken on the task of dissecting the hidden emotional responses of doctors, and how these directly influence patients. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; How do the stresses of medical life—from paperwork to grueling hours to lawsuits to facing death—affect the medical care that doctors can offer their patients? Digging deep into the lives of doctors, Ofri examines the daunting range of emotions—shame, anger, empathy, frustration, hope, pride, occasionally despair, and sometimes even love—that permeate the contemporary doctor-patient connection. Drawing on scientific studies, including some surprising research, Dr. Danielle Ofri offers up an unflinching look at the impact of emotions on health care.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With her renowned eye for dramatic detail, Dr. Ofri takes us into the swirling heart of patient care, telling stories of caregivers caught up and occasionally torn down by the whirlwind life of doctoring. She admits to the humiliation of an error that nearly killed one of her patients and her forever fear of making another. She mourns when a beloved patient is denied a heart transplant. She tells the riveting stories of an intern traumatized when she is forced to let a newborn die in her arms, and of a doctor whose daily glass of wine to handle the frustrations of the ER escalates into a destructive addiction. But doctors don’t only feel fear, grief, and frustration. Ofri also reveals that doctors tell bad jokes about “toxic sock syndrome,” cope through gallows humor, find hope in impossible situations, and surrender to ecstatic happiness when they triumph over illness.  The stories here reveal the undeniable truth that emotions have a distinct effect on how doctors care for their patients. For both clinicians and patients, understanding what doctors feel can make all the difference in giving and getting the best medical care.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </description>
