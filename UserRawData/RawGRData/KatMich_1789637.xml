  <description>At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of five decades, &lt;i&gt;The Dutch House&lt;/i&gt; is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.</description>

  <description>The Angry Therapist who has helped thousands of men find more happiness in their relationships and more purpose in their lives now shares his insights with everyone in this powerful guide—self-help in a shotglass—covering essential topics, from vulnerability and posturing to workouts and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in post-divorce soul searching, John Kim came to an astonishing realization: he was a miserable f*ck who might just be to blame for the problems in his life. Armed with this new insight, he began &lt;em&gt;The Angry Therapist&lt;/em&gt; blog—an admission that, while he was a licensed therapist and life coach, he was no better than the people who sought his advice. In his first post, “My Fucking Feelings,” he wrote about the struggles and shortcomings that had led him to this point. As his work caught on, catapulting him into the role of unlikely and unconventional guide for thousands of people all over the world, Kim evolved from behaving like a boy to living like a man—and showed his clients how to do so as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;I Used to Be a Miserable F*ck&lt;/em&gt;, Kim delivers the dos and don’ts for stepping up and into manhood, which he defines by transparency and strength of character, not six-pack abs or a corner office. With his signature no-nonsense approach that will make you laugh and think, Kim takes you on a rugged, rough and tumble road trip of self-exploration and discovery, sharing his wisdom and insights, such as why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being nice is for boys, and being kind is for men&lt;br /&gt;Scheduling man dates could make you a better friend, lover, and human being&lt;br /&gt;Peeing in the shower is a sign of a larger problem&lt;br /&gt;Arguing, judging, and answering, “I dunno” are keeping you from a healthy relationship, a great career, and a happy life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not born men. We are born boys. The transition from misery to meaning is an internal process that requires work: reflection, pain, courage, and sometimes, a rebirth. Kim knows because he’s been there. The truth is, men weren’t meant to just pay bills and die. With this book as your guide, you will love hard, walk tall, and find a life filled with purpose and passion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Aaron Dignan helps his clients get unstuck by teaching them how to eliminate red tape, tap into collective intelligence, and rethink long-held traditions that no longer make sense. Now he shows us how to do the same.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you and your colleagues frustrated by policies that slow you down? Unsure how to reorganize for an era of uncertainty? Overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of your organization? Afraid your team will lose its culture as it grows? Distracted from real work by the deluge of meetings and email?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're not alone -- and Aaron Dignan can show you a better way. He helps companies around the world use a proven process to become much less bureaucratic and rigid. His book is packed with new tactics and strategies for updating your company's operating system: the fundamental assumptions so deeply embedded that we don't even think to question them (e.g. budgets should be done annually; employees need finanical incentives; marketers should sit with marketers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dignan illuminates twelve areas where your organization might be squandering its potential. Among his questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; Is it clear who can make decisions? And are decisions made at the edge, where the market is changing? Or do ideas die on the journey up the chain of command, or worse, in committees and consensus?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; Is your organizational information accessible, searchable, and usable by everyone? Or are your best ideas trapped in email chains and PowerPoints?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; Are you working in a hierarchy of slow, uncoordinated functions, or a flexible network of dynamic teams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is for managers frustrated with bureaucracy yet suspicious of newfangled approaches where no one has a boss. Dignan offers realistic methods for testing and scaling new ways of working without terrifying anyone, so you can reignite passion and energy throughout your organization.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A bold and inspiring memoir and manifesto &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;from a renowned voice in the women's leadership movement who shows women how to cultivate the single skill they really need in order to thrive: the ability to let go.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the poster girl for doing it all, after she had her first child, Tiffany Dufu struggled to accomplish everything she thought she needed to in order to succeed. Like so many driven and talented women who have been brought up to believe that to have it all, they must do it all, Dufu began to feel that achieving her career and personal goals was an impossibility. Eventually, she discovered the solution: letting go. In &lt;i&gt;Drop the Ball&lt;/i&gt;, Dufu recounts how she learned to reevaluate expectations, shrink her to-do list, and meaningfully engage the assistance of others—freeing the space she needed to flourish at work and to develop deeper, more meaningful relationships at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though women are half the workforce, they still represent only eighteen per cent of the highest level leaders. The reasons are obvious: just as women reach middle management they are also starting families. Mounting responsibilities at work and home leave them with no bandwidth to do what will most lead to their success. Offering new perspective on why the women’s leadership movement has stalled, and packed with actionable advice, Tiffany Dufu’s &lt;i&gt;Drop the Ball&lt;/i&gt; urges women to embrace imperfection, to expect less of themselves and more from others—only then can they focus on what they truly care about, devote the necessary energy to achieving their real goals, and create the type of rich, rewarding life we all desire.</description>

  <description>We all came to the powwow for different reasons. The messy, dangling threads of our lives got pulled into a braid--tied to the back of everything we'd been doing all along to get us here. There will be death and playing dead, there will be screams and unbearable silences, forever-silences, and a kind of time-travel, at the moment the gunshots start, when we look around and see ourselves as we are, in our regalia, and something in our blood will recoil then boil hot enough to burn through time and place and memory. We'll go back to where we came from, when we were people running from bullets at the end of that old world. The tragedy of it all will be unspeakable, that we've been fighting for decades to be recognized as a present-tense people, modern and relevant, only to die in the grass wearing feathers."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, the powerful story of how a prominent white supremacist changed his heart and mind&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Black grew up at the epicenter of white nationalism. His father founded Stormfront, the largest racist community on the Internet. His godfather, David Duke, was a KKK Grand Wizard. By the time Derek turned nineteen, he had become an elected politician with his own daily radio show – already regarded as the “the leading light” of the burgeoning white nationalist movement. “We can infiltrate,” Derek once told a crowd of white nationalists. “We can take the country back.”&lt;br /&gt; Then he went to college. Derek had been home-schooled by his parents, steeped in the culture of white supremacy, and he had rarely encountered diverse perspectives or direct outrage against his beliefs. At New College of Florida, he continued to broadcast his radio show in secret each morning, living a double life until a classmate uncovered his identity and sent an email to the entire school. “Derek Black…white supremacist, radio host…New College student???”&lt;br /&gt; The ensuing uproar overtook one of the most liberal colleges in the country. Some students protested Derek’s presence on campus, forcing him to reconcile for the first time with the ugliness his beliefs. Other students found the courage to reach out to him, including an Orthodox Jew who invited Derek to attend weekly Shabbat dinners. It was because of those dinners–and the wide-ranging relationships formed at that table–that Derek started to question the science, history and prejudices behind his worldview. As white nationalism infiltrated the political mainstream, Derek decided to confront the damage he had done.&lt;br /&gt; Rising Out of Hatred tells the story of how white-supremacist ideas migrated from the far-right fringe to the White House through the intensely personal saga of one man who eventually disavowed everything he was taught to believe, at tremendous personal cost. With great empathy and narrative verve, Eli Saslow asks what Derek’s story can tell us about America’s increasingly divided nature. This is a book to help us understand the American moment and to help us better understand one another.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Editors' Choice &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this poignant memoir of personal transformation, Jill Soloway takes us on a patriarchy-toppling emotional and professional journey. When Jill's parent came out as transgender, Jill pushed through the male-dominated landscape of Hollywood to create the groundbreaking and award-winning Amazon TV series &lt;i&gt;Transparent. &lt;/i&gt;Exploring identity, love, sexuality, and the blurring of boundaries through the dynamics of a complicated and profoundly resonant American family, &lt;i&gt;Transparent&lt;/i&gt; gave birth to a new cultural consciousness. While working on the show and exploding mainstream ideas about gender, Jill began to erase the lines on their own map, finding their voice as a director, show creator, and activist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She Wants It: Desire, Power, and Toppling the Patriarchy&lt;/i&gt; moves with urgent rhythms, wild candor, and razor-edged humor to chart Jill's evolution from straight, married mother of two to identifying as queer and nonbinary. This intense and revelatory metamorphosis challenges the status quo and reflects the shifting power dynamics that continue to shape our collective worldview. With unbridled insight that offers a rare front seat to the inner workings of the #metoo movement and its aftermath, Jill captures the zeitgeist of a generation with thoughtful and revolutionary ideas about gender, inclusion, desire, and consent.</description>

  <description>One day a few years ago, 300 migrants were kidnapped between the remote desert towns of Altar, Mexico, and Sasabe, Arizona. A local priest got 120 released, many with broken ankles and other marks of abuse, but the rest vanished. Óscar Martínez, a young writer from El Salvador, was in Altar soon after the abduction, and his account of the migrant disappearances is only one of the harrowing stories he garnered from two years spent traveling up and down the migrant trail from Central America and across the US border. More than a quarter of a million Central Americans make this increasingly dangerous journey each year, and each year as many as 20,000 of them are kidnapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martínez writes in powerful, unforgettable prose about clinging to the tops of freight trains; finding respite, work and hardship in shelters and brothels; and riding shotgun with the border patrol. Illustrated with stunning full-color photographs, &lt;i&gt;The Beast &lt;/i&gt;is the first book to shed light on the harsh new reality of the migrant trail in the age of the &lt;i&gt;narcotraficantes&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this breakout book, Ijeoma Oluo explores the complex reality of today's racial landscape--from white privilege and police brutality to systemic discrimination and the Black Lives Matter movement--offering straightforward clarity that readers need to contribute to the dismantling of the racial divide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race,&lt;/i&gt; Editor at Large of The Establishment Ijeoma Oluo offers a contemporary, accessible take on the racial landscape in America, addressing head-on such issues as privilege, police brutality, intersectionality, micro-aggressions, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the "N" word. Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don't dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned, and crystalize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and Jessica Valenti in &lt;i&gt;Full Frontal Feminism,&lt;/i&gt; and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor's seminal essay "The Meaning of a Word."</description>

  <description>A historian of fascism offers a guide for surviving and resisting America’s turn towards authoritarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 9th, millions of Americans woke up to the impossible: the election of Donald Trump as president. Against all predictions, one of the most-disliked presidential candidates in history had swept the electoral college, elevating a man with open contempt for democratic norms and institutions to the height of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timothy Snyder is one of the most celebrated historians of the Holocaust. In his books &lt;i&gt;Bloodlands&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Black Earth&lt;/i&gt;, he has carefully dissected the events and values that enabled the rise of Hitler and Stalin and the execution of their catastrophic policies. With &lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, Snyder draws from the darkest hours of the twentieth century to provide hope for the twenty-first. As he writes, “Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism and communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt; is a call to arms and a guide to resistance, with invaluable ideas for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Bloomberg Technology&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; reporter Emily Chang confronts Silicon Valley's rampant sexism, excluding women from the greatest wealth creation of our generation.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicon Valley has long prided itself on being the land of opportunity, where anyone with a big idea can make it a reality, and where the new Masters of the Universe change the world for the better. But the bitter truth is that women have been excluded, marginalized, and harassed from the start. Sexism and the gender gap in Silicon Valley are only getting worse. It's not a utopia - it's a "brotopia" for tech bros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scope of tech reporter Emily Chang's &lt;i&gt;Brotopia&lt;/i&gt; is wide--from front page scandals to behind-the-scenes stories that key players reveal directly. Chang reports on the forces conspiring against women in the workplace, and outside of it as well--from sex parties filled with VCs and entrepreneurs and rampant online pornography to outright harassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of silence, women are now coming forward to bravely reveal their stories. Sixty percent of women in tech have experienced sexual harassment, but offenders don't get punished--they get excused because they're top performers, aided and abetted by a venture capital boys club of extremely wealthy and privileged investors. Women in tech suffer devastating consequences, and many consider leaving the industry every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chang explores how this culture came to be, what it means, and what can be done to fix it. She delves into the seedy underbelly of shiny Silicon Valley, weaving together hard-hitting interviews with major influencers like Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, Tim Cook, Peter Thiel, Ellen Pao and more. She reveals the secrets that tech companies have tried to hide for years, and offers a fresh set of tangible solutions about what can be done to level the playing field.</description>

  <description>For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland where millions of dollars grow on trees. It's a "Brotopia," where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this powerful exposé, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they "won't lower their standards" just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It's time to break up the boys' club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture--to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.</description>

  <description>Do the Work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our enemy is not lack of preparation; it's not the difficulty of the project, or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enemy is resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications and a million reasons why he can't/shouldn't/won't do what we know we need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start before you're ready.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia&lt;/i&gt;, a love story that unfolds in a world being irrevocably transformed by migration.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair, thrust into premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As violence and the threat of violence escalate, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through  . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Exit West&lt;/i&gt; is an epic compressed into a slender page-turner—both completely of our time and for all time, Mohsin Hamid’s most ambitious and electrifying novel yet.</description>

The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls.</description>

  <description>For twenty-five years, Positive Discipline has been the gold standard reference for grown-ups working with children. Now Jane Nelsen, distinguished psychologist, educator, and mother of seven, has written a revised and expanded edition. The key to positive discipline is not punishment, she tells us, but mutual respect. Nelsen coaches parents and teachers to be both firm and kind, so that any child–from a three-year-old toddler to a rebellious teenager–can learn creative cooperation and self-discipline with no loss of dignity. Inside you’ll discover how to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• bridge communication gaps&lt;br /&gt;• defuse power struggles&lt;br /&gt;• avoid the dangers of praise&lt;br /&gt;• enforce your message of love&lt;br /&gt;• build on strengths, not weaknesses&lt;br /&gt;• hold children accountable with their self-respect intact&lt;br /&gt;• teach children not what to think but how to think&lt;br /&gt;• win cooperation at home and at school&lt;br /&gt;• meet the special challenge of teen misbehavior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is not easy to improve a classic book, but Jane Nelson has done so in this revised edition. Packed with updated examples that are clear and specific, Positive Discipline shows parents exactly how to focus on solutions while being kind and firm. If you want to enrich your relationship with your children, this is the book for you.”&lt;br /&gt;–Sal Severe, author of How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of children have already benefited from the counsel in this wise and warmhearted book, which features dozens of true stories of positive discipline in action. Give your child the tools he or she needs for a well-adjusted life with this proven treasure trove of practical advice.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/i&gt;: a searingly honest memoir of food, weight, self-image, and learning how to feed your hunger while taking care of yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as “wildly undisciplined,” Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her own past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt;, Princeton sociologist and MacArthur "Genius" Matthew Desmond follows eight families in Milwaukee as they struggle to keep a roof over their heads. &lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt; transforms our understanding of poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving one of 21st-century America's most devastating problems. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.</description>

  <description>The creator of the viral hit "Empathy Cards" teams up with a compassion expert to produce a visually stunning and groundbreaking illustrated guide to help you increase your emotional intelligence and learn how to offer comfort and support when someone you know is in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone you know is hurting, you want to let her know that you care. But many people don’t know what words to use—or are afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. This thoughtful, instructive guide, from empathy expert Dr. Kelsey Crowe and greeting card maverick Emily McDowell, blends well-researched, actionable advice with the no-nonsense humor and the signature illustration style of McDowell's immensely popular Empathy Cards, to help you feel confident in connecting with anyone experiencing grief, loss, illness, or any other difficult situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in a how-to, relatable, we’ve-all-been-that-deer-in-the-headlights kind of way, &lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a spiritual treatise on how to make you a better person or a scientific argument about why compassion matters. It is a helpful illustrated guide to effective compassion that takes you, step by step by step, past the paralysis of thinking about someone in a difficult time to actually doing something (or nothing) with good judgment instead of fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; features workbook exercises, sample dialogs, and real-life examples from Dr. Crowe’s research, including her popular "Empathy Bootcamps" that give people tools for building relationships when it really counts. Whether it’s a coworker whose mother has died, a neighbor whose husband has been in a car accident, or a friend who is seriously ill, &lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to be the best friend you can be to someone in need.</description>

  <description>Jamie Glowacki—potty-training expert, Pied Piper of Poop, and author of the popular guide, &lt;i&gt;Oh Crap! Potty Training&lt;/i&gt;—shares her proven 6-step plan to help you toilet train your preschooler quickly and successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let Jamie Glowacki, potty-training expert and the popular "Pied Piper of Poop" show you how it's done. Her 6-step, proven process to get your toddler out of diapers and onto the toilet has already worked for tens of thousands of kids and their parents. Here's the good news: your child is probably ready to be potty trained EARLIER than you think (ideally, between 20-30 months), and it can be done FASTER than you expect (most kids get the basics in a few days—but Jamie's got you covered even if it takes a little longer). If you've ever said to yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** How do I know if my kid is ready?&lt;br /&gt; ** Why won't my child poop in the potty?&lt;br /&gt; ** How do I avoid "potty power struggles"?&lt;br /&gt; ** How can I get their daycare provider on board?&lt;br /&gt; ** My kid was doing so well—why is he regressing?&lt;br /&gt; ** And what about nighttime?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh Crap! Potty Training&lt;/i&gt; can solve all of these (and other) common issues. This isn't theory, you're not bribing with candy, and there are no gimmicks. This is real-world, from-the-trenches potty training information—all the questions and all the ANSWERS you need to do it once and be done with diapers for good.</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN B003JTHWKU&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, &lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/i&gt; is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Contented Little Baby Book&lt;/i&gt;, based on Gina Ford's personal experience of caring for over 300 babies, was first published in 1999. It quickly established Gina as an influential new authority on baby and childcare issues and has remained one of the bestselling parenting books in the UK for almost 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This completely revised edition of &lt;i&gt;The New Contented Little Baby Book&lt;/i&gt; contains the most up-to-date advice available to parents. Using the feedback from numerous readers and website members, Gina has been able to develop and elaborate on the information in her first book, while clearly setting out her philosophy on simple feeding and sleeping routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By creating routines that match a growing baby's innate natural rhythms, Gina prevents the hunger, overtiredness and colic that can lead to excessive crying. Babies who are settled into Gina's gentle routines are happy and contented because their needs for food and sleep are appropriately met and they should sleep for their longest spell at night from an early age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With detailed, prescriptive information on everything parents need to know, this book includes chapters on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Preparation for the birth&lt;br /&gt;- How the routines evolved and the benefits of following a routine&lt;br /&gt;- Milk feeding in the first year&lt;br /&gt;- Understanding your baby's sleep&lt;br /&gt;- Establishing a routine&lt;br /&gt;- Introducing solid food in line with government and World Health Authority guidelines&lt;br /&gt;- Common problems in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are expecting your first child, or are experiencing difficulties with an older baby, this comprehensive guide contains all the expert guidance you need to help your baby feed and sleep well.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed filmmaker, artist, and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;No One Belongs Here More Than You,&lt;/i&gt; a spectacular debut novel that is so heartbreaking, so dirty, so tender, so funny--so Miranda July--readers will be blown away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is Cheryl, a tightly-wound, vulnerable woman who lives alone, with a perpetual lump in her throat. She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people's babies. Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women's self-defense non-profit where she works. She believes they've been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to consummate in this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cheryl's bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter Clee can move into her house for a little while, Cheryl's eccentrically-ordered world explodes. And yet it is Clee--the selfish, cruel blond bombshell--who bullies Cheryl into reality and, unexpectedly, provides her the love of a lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tender, gripping, slyly hilarious, infused with raging sexual fantasies and fierce maternal love, Miranda July's first novel confirms her as a spectacularly original, iconic and important voice today, and a writer for all time. &lt;i&gt;The First Bad Man&lt;/i&gt; is dazzling, disorienting, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>Women today are celebrating pregnancy like never before. The new attitude of expectant moms is one of cheerful anticipation, optimism, and pride in their changing bodies. The Joy of Pregnancy reflects this positive spirit by emphasizing what's normal, fun, and even funny about pregnancy. In a lighthearted and encouraging tone, Tori Kropp helps mothers- and fathers-to-be concentrate on the miracle of pregnancy and birth rather than on possible complications. The month-by-month format provides the essential information that expectant parents crave: how the baby is developing, how the mother's body is changing, how to prepare for birth and baby, and the pros and cons of various pregnancy-related choices and issues. Tori's tone is reassuring, nonjudgmental, and often humorous. Questions and answers from her online community Stork SiteÂ®, highlighted tips, and facts make the text fun to read as well as informative. With this book by their side, expectant parents will be prepared to take an active role in ensuring a healthy, happy, and truly joyful pregnancy.</description>

  <description>T&lt;b&gt;he runaway &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that shows American parents the secrets behind France's amazingly well-behaved children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;When American journalist Pamela Druckerman had a baby in Paris, she didn't aspire to become a "French parent." But she noticed that French children slept through the night by two or three months old. They ate braised leeks. They played by themselves while their parents sipped coffee. And yet French kids were still boisterous, curious, and creative. Why? How?            With a notebook stashed in her diaper bag, Druckerman set out to investigate—and wound up sparking a national debate on parenting. Researched over three years and written in her warm, funny voice, &lt;i&gt;Bringing Up Bébé&lt;/i&gt; is deeply wise, charmingly told, and destined to become a classic resource for American parents.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Thousands of books have examined the effects of parents on their children. Award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior now asks: what are the effects of children on their parents?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All Joy and No Fun is an indispensable map for a journey that most of us take without one. Brilliant, funny, and brimming with insight, this is an important book that every parent should read, and then read again. Jennifer Senior is surely one of the best writers on the planet."-Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In All Joy and No Fun, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior isolates and analyzes the many ways in which children reshape their parents' lives, whether it's their marriages, their jobs, their habits, their hobbies, their friendships, or their internal senses of self. She argues that changes in the last half century have radically altered the roles of today's mothers and fathers, making their mandates at once more complex and far less clear. Recruiting from a wide variety of sources-in history, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology-she dissects both the timeless strains of parenting and the ones that are brand new, and then brings her research to life in the homes of ordinary parents around the country. The result is an unforgettable series of family portraits, starting with parents of young children and progressing to parents of teens. Through lively and accessible storytelling, Senior follows these mothers and fathers as they wrestle with some of parenthood's deepest vexations-and luxuriate in some of its finest rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meticulously researched yet imbued with emotional intelligence, All Joy and No Fun makes us reconsider some of our culture's most basic beliefs about parenthood, all while illuminating the profound ways children deepen and add purpose to our lives. By focusing on parenthood, rather than parenting, the book is original and essential reading for mothers and fathers of today-and tomorrow.</description>

  <description>The publication of this extraordinary volume firmly established Flannery O'Connor's monumental contribution to American fiction. There are thirty-one stories here in all, including twelve that do not appear in the only two story collections O'Connor put together in her short lifetime--Everything That Rises Must Converge and A Good Man Is Hard to Find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O'Connor published her first story, "The Geranium," in 1946, while she was working on her master's degree at the University of Iowa. Arranged chronologically, this collection shows that her last story, "Judgement Day"--sent to her publisher shortly before her death—is a brilliantly rewritten and transfigured version of "The Geranium." Taken together, these stories reveal a lively, penetrating talent that has given us some of the most powerful and disturbing fiction of the twentieth century. Also included is an introduction by O'Connor's longtime editor and friend, Robert Giroux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reproduction of this publisher's 1971 edition.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism from one of the most-watched young cultural observers of her generation, Roxane Gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Pink is my favorite color. I used to say my favorite color was black to be &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, but it is pink—all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink. I read &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m not doing it ironically, though it might seem that way. I once live-tweeted the September issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these funny and insightful essays, Roxane Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman (&lt;em&gt;Sweet Valley High&lt;/em&gt;) of color (&lt;em&gt;The Help&lt;/em&gt;) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years (&lt;em&gt;Girls, Django in Chains&lt;/em&gt;) and commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/em&gt; is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? &lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>Following the success of her breakout poem, "B," Sarah Kay releases her debut collection of poetry featuring work from the first decade of her career.

Both fresh and wise, Kay's poetry allows readers to join in on her journey of discovering herself and the world around her. It's an honest and powerful collection.</description>

  <description>"There is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told," writes Lena Dunham, and it certainly takes guts to share the stories that make up her first book, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt;. These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to "an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw." Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt; establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice.</description>

  <description>Sheryl Sandberg’s &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt; is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</description>

  <description>Life can be hard: your lover cheats on you; you lose a family member; you can’t pay the bills—and it can be great: you’ve had the hottest sex of your life; you get that plum job; you muster the courage to write your novel. Sugar—the once-anonymous online columnist at &lt;i&gt;The Rumpus, &lt;/i&gt;now revealed as Cheryl Strayed, author of the bestselling memoir &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt;—is the person thousands turn to for advice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tiny Beautiful Things&lt;/i&gt; brings the best of Dear Sugar in one place and includes never-before-published columns and a new introduction by Steve Almond.  Rich with humor, insight, compassion—and absolute honesty—this book&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is a balm for everything life throws our way.</description>

  <description>Written by Naoki Higashida, a very smart, very self-aware, and very charming thirteen-year-old boy with autism, it is a one-of-a-kind memoir that demonstrates how an autistic mind thinks, feels, perceives, and responds in ways few of us can imagine. Parents and family members who never thought they could get inside the head of their autistic loved one, at last, have a way to break through to the curious, subtle, and complex life within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using an alphabet grid to painstakingly construct words, sentences, and thoughts that he is unable to speak out loud, Naoki answers even the most delicate questions that people want to know. Questions such as: “Why do people with autism talk so loudly and weirdly?” “Why do you line up your toy cars and blocks?” “Why don’t you make eye contact when you’re talking?” and “What’s the reason you jump?” (Naoki’s answer: “When I’m jumping, it’s as if my feelings are going upward to the sky.”) With disarming honesty and a generous heart, Naoki shares his unique point of view on not only autism but life itself. His insights—into the mystery of words, the wonders of laughter, and the elusiveness of memory—are so startling, so strange, and so powerful that you will never look at the world the same way again.</description>

  <description>The best-selling animal advocate Temple Grandin offers the most exciting exploration of how animals feel since The Hidden Life of Dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her groundbreaking and best-selling book Animals in Translation, Temple Grandin drew on her own experience with autism as well as her distinguished career as an animal scientist to deliver extraordinary insights into how animals think, act, and feel. Now she builds on those insights to show us how to give our animals the best and happiest life—on their terms, not ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s usually easy to pinpoint the cause of physical pain in animals, but to know what is causing them emotional distress is much harder. rawing on the latest research and her own work,Grandin identifies the core emotional needs of animals. Then she explains how to fulfill them for dogs and cats, horses, farm animals, and zoo animals.Whether it’s how to make the healthiest environment for the dog you must leave alone most of the day, how to keep pigs from being bored, or how to know if the lion pacing in the zoo is miserable or just exercising, Grandin teaches us to challenge our assumptions about animal contentment and honor our bond with our fellow creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Animals Make Us Human is the culmination of almost thirty years of research, experimentation, and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essential reading for anyone who’s ever owned, cared for, or simply cared about an animal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Popular leadership blogger gives the low-down on standing up for yourself&lt;/b&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Pushback&lt;/i&gt;, top leadership consultant Selena Rezvani argues that self-advocacy is critical to success. Yet women initiate negotiations four times less often than men, resulting in getting less of what they want--promotion opportunities, plum assignments, and higher pay. This book shines a light on the real rules of holding your own and pushing back for what is rightfully yours. Drawing on interviews with high-level leaders, Rezvani offers readers in the first half of their career the unedited truth about how women have asked their way to the top and triumphed--and how you can too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes interviews with top business leaders such as Marie Chandoha, CEO of Charles Schwab Investment Management; Cindi Bigelow, President of Bigelow Tea Company; Fizzah Jafri, COO at Morgan Stanley; Rosemary Turner, President at UPS; and Irene Chang Britt, Chief Strategy Officer at Campbell's Soup Offers a reliable and methodic approach to negotiating and navigating tough conversations Highlights compelling facts and research from the world of psychology and leadership Insightful and accessible, &lt;i&gt;Pushback&lt;/i&gt; is a timely resource for savvy women who want to leverage their skills, promote themselves effectively, and fast track their careers.</description>

  <description>This extraordinary collection of personal correspondence has all the hallmarks of Kurt Vonnegut's fiction. Written over a sixty-year period, these letters, the vast majority of them never before published, are funny, moving, and full of the same uncanny wisdom that has endeared his work to readers worldwide. &lt;br /&gt; Included in this comprehensive volume: the letter a twenty-two-year-old Vonnegut wrote home immediately upon being freed from a German POW camp, recounting the ghastly firebombing of Dresden that would be the subject of his masterpiece "Slaughterhouse-Five;" wry dispatches from Vonnegut's years as a struggling writer slowly finding an audience and then dealing with sudden international fame in middle age; righteously angry letters of protest to local school boards that tried to ban his work; intimate remembrances penned to high school classmates, fellow veterans, friends, and family; and letters of commiseration and encouragement to such contemporaries as Gail Godwin, Gunter Grass, and Bernard Malamud. &lt;br /&gt; Vonnegut's unmediated observations on science, art, and commerce prove to be just as inventive as any found in his novels--from a crackpot scheme for manufacturing "atomic" bow ties to a tongue-in-cheek proposal that publishers be allowed to trade authors like baseball players. ("Knopf, for example, might give John Updike's contract to Simon and Schuster, and receive Joan Didion's contract in return.") Taken together, these letters add considerable depth to our understanding of this one-of-a-kind literary icon, in both his public and private lives. Each letter brims with the mordant humor and openhearted humanism upon which he built his legend. And virtually every page contains a quotable nugget that will make its way into the permanent Vonnegut lexicon. &lt;br /&gt;- On a job he had as a young man: "Hell is running an elevator throughout eternity in a building with only six floors."&lt;br /&gt;- To a relative who calls him a "great literary figure" "I am an American fad--of a slightly higher order than the hula hoop."&lt;br /&gt;- To his daughter Nanny: "Most letters from a parent contain a parent's own lost dreams disguised as good advice."&lt;br /&gt;- To Norman Mailer: "I am cuter than you are." &lt;br /&gt; Sometimes biting and ironical, sometimes achingly sweet, and always alive with the unique point of view that made him the true cultural heir to Mark Twain, these letters comprise the autobiography Kurt Vonnegut never wrote.</description>

  <description>Virginia Woolf introduced us to the “Angel in the House”, now prepare to meet... &lt;i&gt;The Bitch In the House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women today have more choices than at any time in history, yet many smart, ambitious, contemporary women are finding themselves angry, dissatisfied, stressed out. Why are they dissatisfied? And what do they really want? These questions form the premise of this passionate, provocative, funny, searingly honest collection of original essays in which twenty-six women writers—ranging in age from twenty-four to sixty-five, single and childless or married with children or four times divorced—invite readers into their lives, minds, and bedrooms to talk about the choices they’ve made, what’s working, and what’s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With wit and humor, in prose as poetic and powerful as it is blunt and dead-on, these intriguing women offer details of their lives that they’ve never publicly revealed before, candidly sounding off on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The difficult decisions and compromises of living with lovers, marrying, staying single and having children&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The perpetual tug of war between love and work, family and career&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The struggle to simultaneously care for ailing parents and a young family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The myth of co-parenting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Dealing with helpless mates and needy toddlers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The constrictions of traditional women’s roles as well as the cliches of feminism&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Anger at laid-back live-in lovers content to live off a hardworking woman’s checkbook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Anger at being criticized for one’s weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Anger directed at their mothers, right and wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• And–well–more anger...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book was born out of anger,” begins Cathi Hanauer, but the end result is an intimate sharing of experience that will move, amuse, and enlighten. &lt;i&gt;The Bitch in the House&lt;/i&gt; is a perfect companion for your students as they plot a course through the many voices of modern feminism. This is the sound of the collective voice of successful women today-in all their anger, grace, and glory.</description>

      <![CDATA[Miranda gave this to me when I got engaged about 6 years ago, and I don't think I ever finished it. When going through my books I decided I needed to give it another read. I liked some of the essays more than others, but overall I really liked the diversity of the stories. There isn't really one...]]>

  <description>From the best–selling author of &lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; comes this gloriously entertaining and enlightening look into the sex lives of Iranian women. &lt;i&gt;Embroideries&lt;/i&gt; gathers together Marjane’s tough–talking grandmother, stoic mother, glamorous and eccentric aunt and their friends and neighbors for an afternoon of tea drinking and talking. Naturally, the subject turns to love, sex and the vagaries of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the afternoon progresses, these vibrant women share their secrets, their regrets and their often outrageous stories about, among other things, how to fake one’s virginity, how to escape an arranged marriage, how to enjoy the miracles of plastic surgery and how to delight in being a mistress. By turns revealing and hilarious, these are stories about the lengths to which some women will go to find a man, keep a man or, most important, keep up appearances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of surprises, this introduction to the private lives of some fascinating women, whose life stories and lovers will strike us as at once deeply familiar and profoundly different from our own, is sure to bring smiles of recognition to the faces of women everywhere—and to teach us all a thing or two.</description>

  <description>Wrapped in the landscape of a blustery Wisconsin winter, Blankets explores the sibling rivalry of two brothers growing up in the isolated country, and the budding romance of two coming-of-age lovers. A tale of security and discovery, of playfulness and tragedy, of a fall from grace and the origins of faith.</description>

  <description>The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality. The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitation—and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.</description>

  <description>The study of sexual physiology - what happens, and why, and how to make it happen better - has been a paying career or a diverting sideline for scientists as far-ranging as Leonardo da Vinci and James Watson. The research has taken place behind the closed doors of laboratories, brothels, MRI centers, pig farms, sex-toy R&amp;amp;D labs, and Alfred Kinsey's attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Roach, "the funniest science writer in the country" (Burkhard Bilger of 'The New Yorker'), devoted the past two years to stepping behind those doors. Can a person think herself to orgasm? Can a dead man get an erection? Is vaginal orgasm a myth? Why doesn't Viagra help women or, for that matter, pandas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 'Bonk', Roach shows us how and why sexual arousal and orgasm, two of the most complex, delightful, and amazing scientific phenomena on earth, can be so hard to achieve and what science is doing to slowly make the bedroom a more satisfying place. 16 illustrations.</description>

  <description>If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it. Dr. Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients struggling to adapt to often bizarre worlds of neurological disorder. Here are people who can no longer recognize everyday objects or those they love; who are stricken with violent tics or shout involuntary obscenities; who have been dismissed as autistic or retarded, yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales illuminate what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the first of your premises to check.</description>

  <description>A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/i&gt; “Best Comix of the Year”&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; Best-seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wise, funny, and heartbreaking, &lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is Marjane Satrapi’s memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, &lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt; is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Ghost World&lt;/em&gt; has become a cultural and generational touchstone, and continues to enthrall and inspire readers over a decade after its original release as a graphic novel. Originally serialized in the pages of the seminal comic book &lt;em&gt;Eightball&lt;/em&gt; throughout the mid-1990s, this quasi-autobiographical story (the name of one of the protagonists is famously an anagram of the author's name) follows the adventures of two teenage girls, Enid and Becky, two best friends facing the prospect of growing up, and more importantly, apart. Daniel Clowes is one of the most respected cartoonists of his generation, and &lt;em&gt;Ghost World&lt;/em&gt; is his magnum opus. Adapted into a major motion picture directed by Terry Zwigoff (director of the acclaimed documentary &lt;em&gt;Crumb&lt;/em&gt;), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. This graphic novel is a must for any self-respecting comics fan's library.</description>

  <description>"What happens when we die? Does the light just go out and that's that—the million-year nap? Or will some part of my personality, my me-ness persist? What will that feel like? What will I do all day? Is there a place to plug in my lap-top?" In an attempt to find out, Mary Roach brings her tireless curiosity to bear on an array of contemporary and historical soul-searchers: scientists, schemers, engineers, mediums, all trying to prove (or disprove) that life goes on after we die.</description>

  <description>'An act of consummate literary bravery, a writer known for her clarity allowing us to watch her mind as it becomes clouded with grief.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of America's iconic writers, a stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Joan Didion explores an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage–and a life, in good times and bad–that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill with what seemed at first flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later–the night before New Year's Eve–the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful book is Didion's attempt to make sense of the "weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness . . . about marriage and children and memory . . . about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself."</description>

  <description>Nine years before the Senate campaign that made him one of the most influential and compelling voices in American politics, Barack Obama published this lyrical, unsentimental, and powerfully affecting memoir, which became a #1 New York Times bestseller when it was reissued in 2004. Dreams from My Father tells the story of Obama’s struggle to understand the forces that shaped him as the son of a black African father and white American mother—a struggle that takes him from the American heartland to the ancestral home of his great-aunt in the tiny African village of Alego. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama opens his story in New York, where he hears that his father—a figure he knows more as a myth than as a man—has died in a car accident. The news triggers a chain of memories as Barack retraces his family’s unusual history: the migration of his mother’s family from small-town Kansas to the Hawaiian islands; the love that develops between his mother and a promising young Kenyan student, a love nurtured by youthful innocence and the integrationist spirit of the early sixties; his father’s departure from Hawaii when Barack was two, as the realities of race and power reassert themselves; and Barack’s own awakening to the fears and doubts that exist not just between the larger black and white worlds but within himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propelled by a desire to understand both the forces that shaped him and his father’s legacy, Barack moves to Chicago to work as a community organizer. There, against the backdrop of tumultuous political and racial conflict, he works to turn back the mounting despair of the inner city. His story becomes one with those of the people he works with as he learns about the value of community, the necessity of healing old wounds, and the possibility of faith in the midst of adversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barack’s journey comes full circle in Kenya, where he finally meets the African side of his family and confronts the bitter truth of his father’s life. Traveling through a country racked by brutal poverty and tribal conflict, but whose people are sustained by a spirit of endurance and hope, Barack discovers that he is inescapably bound to brothers and sisters living an ocean away—and that by embracing their common struggles he can finally reconcile his divided inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A searching meditation on the meaning of identity in America, Dreams from My Father might be the most revealing portrait we have of a major American leader—a man who is playing, and will play, an increasingly prominent role in healing a fractious and fragmented nation.</description>

  <description>Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but here Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from California's subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many fast food's flavors are concocted. Along the way, he unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. &lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition exists &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34668905.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.</description>

  <description>Countless writers and artists have spoken for a generation, but no one has done it quite like Chuck Klosterman. With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether deconstructing &lt;i&gt;Saved by the Bell&lt;/i&gt; episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of &lt;i&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/i&gt; or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. &lt;i&gt;Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs&lt;/i&gt; is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but -- really -- it's about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, "In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever 'in and of itself.'" Read to believe.</description>

  <description>Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s iconic &lt;i&gt;A People's History of the United States&lt;/i&gt; “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.” Packed with vivid details and telling quotations, Zinn’s award-winning classic continues to revolutionize the way American history is taught and remembered. Frequent appearances in popular media such as &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;/i&gt;, and the History Channel documentary &lt;i&gt;The People Speak&lt;/i&gt; testify to Zinn’s ability to bridge the generation gap with enduring insights into the birth, development, and destiny of the nation</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780141439662&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition includes explanatory notes, textual variants between the first and second editions, and Tony Tanner's introduction to the original Penguin Classic edition.</description>

  <description>At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”</description>

  <description>Victor Mancini, a medical-school dropout, is an antihero for our deranged times. Needing to pay elder care for his mother, Victor has devised an ingenious scam: he pretends to choke on pieces of food while dining in upscale restaurants. He then allows himself to be “saved” by fellow patrons who, feeling responsible for Victor’s life, go on to send checks to support him. When he’s not pulling this stunt, Victor cruises sexual addiction recovery workshops for action, visits his addled mom, and spends his days working at a colonial theme park. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Remember, remember the fifth of November..."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A frightening and powerful tale of the loss of freedom and identity in a chillingly believable totalitarian world, &lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/i&gt; stands as one of the highest achievements of the comics medium and a defining work for creators Alan Moore and David Lloyd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in an imagined future England that has given itself over to fascism, this groundbreaking story captures both the suffocating nature of life in an authoritarian police state and the redemptive power of the human spirit which rebels against it. Crafted with sterling clarity and intelligence, &lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/i&gt; brings an unequaled depth of characterization and verisimilitude to its unflinching account of oppression and resistance.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Middlesex&lt;/i&gt; tells the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides, and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family, who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City and the race riots of 1967 before moving out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, &lt;i&gt;Middlesex&lt;/i&gt; is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.</description>

  <description>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</description>

  <description>"One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911." &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel—a scathing satire on a downtrodden society’s blind march towards totalitarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned—a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.</description>

  <description>Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt;. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that Alcott based &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>When Siddalee Walker, oldest daughter of Vivi Abbott Walker, Ya-Ya extraordinaire, is interviewed in the New York Times about a hit play she's directed, her mother gets described as a "tap-dancing child abuser." Enraged, Vivi disowns Sidda. Devastated, Sidda begs forgiveness, and postpones her upcoming wedding. All looks bleak until the Ya-Yas step in and convince Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of their girlhood mementos, called "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." As Sidda struggles to analyze her mother, she comes face to face with the tangled beauty of imperfect love, and the fact that forgiveness, more than understanding, is often what the heart longs for.</description>

  <description>Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made &lt;i&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/i&gt; a classic, &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt; changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt; we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Breakfast of Champions,&lt;/i&gt; one of Kurt Vonnegut’s  most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously funny satire, as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.</description>

  <description>Though they have the vote and the Pill and haven't been burned as witches since 1727, life isn't exactly a stroll down the catwalk for modern women. They are beset by uncertainties and questions: Why are they supposed to get Brazilians? Why do bras hurt? Why the incessant talk about babies? And do men secretly hate them? Caitlin Moran interweaves provocative observations on women's lives with laugh-out-loud funny scenes from her own, from adolescence to her development as a writer, wife, and mother.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How the Dog Became the Dog&lt;/em&gt; posits that dog was an evolutionary inevitability in the nature of the wolf and its human soul mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural temperament and social structure of humans and wolves are so similar that as soon as they met on the trail they recognized themselves in each other. Both are highly social, accomplished generalists, and creatures of habit capable of adapting? homebodies who like to wander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the Dog Became the Dog&lt;/em&gt; presents domestication of the dog as a biological and cultural process that began in mutual cooperation and has taken a number of radical turns. At the end of the last Ice Age the first dogs emerged with their humans from refuges against the cold. In the eighteenth century, humans began the drive to exercise full control of dog reproduction, life, and death to complete the domestication of the wolf begun so long ago.</description>

  <description>An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20623848-wild" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State — and she would do it alone.&lt;br /&gt;Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt; powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.</description>

  <description>A dystopian thriller follows a boy and girl on the run from a town where all thoughts can be heard – and the passage to manhood embodies a horrible secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Todd Hewitt is the only boy in a town of men. Ever since the settlers were infected with the Noise germ, Todd can hear everything the men think, and they hear everything he thinks. Todd is just a month away from becoming a man, but in the midst of the cacophony, he knows that the town is hiding something from him -- something so awful Todd is forced to flee with only his dog, whose simple, loyal voice he hears too. With hostile men from the town in pursuit, the two stumble upon a strange and eerily silent creature: a girl. Who is she? Why wasn't she killed by the germ like all the females on New World? Propelled by Todd's gritty narration, readers are in for a white-knuckle journey in which a boy on the cusp of manhood must unlearn everything he knows in order to figure out who he truly is.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ok, yeah, I like Young Adult books (as long as they don't involve damsels in distress being rescued by vampires and werewolves). I didn't like this as much as Hunger Games but after getting through the beginning, it's a pretty good page-turner. I like the premise and the world and a lot of the de...]]>

  <description>What if — whoosh, right now, with no explanation — a number of us simply vanished? Would some of us collapse? Would others of us go on, one foot in front of the other, as we did before the world turned upside down? That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened — not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet "A" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heart, intelligence and a rare ability to illuminate the struggles inherent in ordinary lives, Tom Perrotta has written a startling, thought-provoking novel about love, connection and loss.</description>

  <description>Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we "know" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, &lt;i&gt;Sex at Dawn&lt;/i&gt; unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. “The days are long, but the years are short,” she realized. “Time is passing, and I’m not focusing enough on the things that really matter.” In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this lively and compelling account, Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference.</description>

  <description>In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of "why I did stand-up and why I walked away." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Shopgirl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Pleasure of My Company&lt;/i&gt;, and a regular contributor to &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of &lt;i&gt;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&lt;/i&gt; in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; in the seventies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. &lt;i&gt;Born Standing Up&lt;/i&gt; is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.</description>

  <description>Alan Christoffersen, a once-successful advertising executive, wakes one morning to find himself injured, alone, and confined to a hospital bed in Spokane, Washington. Sixteen days earlier, reeling from the sudden loss of his wife, his home, and his business, Alan left everything he knew behind and set off on an extraordinary cross-country journey. Carrying only a backpack, he planned to walk to Key West, the farthest destination on his map. But a vicious roadside stabbing has interrupted Alan’s trek and robbed him of his one source of solace: the ability to walk.Homeless and facing months of difficult recovery, Alan has nowhere to turn—until a mysterious woman enters his life and invites him into her home. Generous and kind, Angel seems almost too good to be true, but all is not as it appears. Alan soon realizes that before he can return to his own journey, he must first help Angel with hers.From one of America’s most beloved and bestselling storytellers comes an astonishing tale of life and death, love and second chances, and why sometimes the best way to heal your own suffering is by helping to heal someone else’s.Inspiring, moving, and full of wisdom, &lt;i&gt;Miles to Go &lt;/i&gt;picks up where the bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Walk &lt;/i&gt;left off, continuing the unforgettable series about one man’s unrelenting search for hope.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Just Kids&lt;/i&gt;, Patti Smith's first book of prose, the legendary American artist offers a never-before-seen glimpse of her remarkable relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the epochal days of New York City and the Chelsea Hotel in the late sixties and seventies. An honest and moving story of youth and friendship, Smith brings the same unique, lyrical quality to &lt;i&gt;Just Kids&lt;/i&gt; as she has to the rest of her formidable body of work--from her influential 1975 album &lt;i&gt;Horses&lt;/i&gt; to her visual art and poetry.</description>

  <description>A grand mystery reaching back centuries. A sensational disappearance that made headlines around the world. A quest for truth that leads to death, madness or disappearance for those who seek to solve it. &lt;i&gt;The Lost City of Z&lt;/i&gt; is a blockbuster adventure narrative about what lies beneath the impenetrable jungle canopy of the Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After stumbling upon a hidden trove of diaries, New Yorker writer David Grann set out to solve "the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century": What happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett &amp;amp; his quest for the Lost City of Z?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1925, Fawcett ventured into the Amazon to find an ancient civilization, hoping to make one of the most important discoveries in history. For centuries Europeans believed the world's largest jungle concealed the glittering kingdom of El Dorado. Thousands had died looking for it, leaving many scientists convinced that the Amazon was truly inimical to humans. But Fawcett, whose daring expeditions inspired Conan Doyle's &lt;i&gt;The Lost World&lt;/i&gt;, had spent years building his scientific case. Captivating the imagination of millions round the globe, Fawcett embarked with his 21-year-old son, determined to prove that this ancient civilisation--which he dubbed Z--existed. Then his expedition vanished. Fawcett's fate, &amp;amp; the tantalizing clues he left behind about Z, became an obsession for hundreds who followed him into the uncharted wilderness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades scientists &amp;amp; adventurers have searched for evidence of Fawcett's party &amp;amp; the lost City of Z. Countless have perished, been captured by tribes or gone mad. As Grann delved ever deeper into the mystery surrounding Fawcett's quest, &amp;amp; the greater mystery of what lies within the Amazon, he found himself, like the generations who preceded him, being irresistibly drawn into the jungle's green hell. His quest for the truth &amp;amp; discoveries about Fawcett's fate &amp;amp; Z form the heart of this complexly enthralling narrative.</description>

  <description>Featuring David Sedaris's unique blend of hilarity and heart, this new collection of keen-eyed animal-themed tales is an utter delight. Though the characters may not be human, the situations in these stories bear an uncanny resemblance to the insanity of everyday life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "The Toad, the Turtle, and the Duck," three strangers commiserate about animal bureaucracy while waiting in a complaint line. In "Hello Kitty," a cynical feline struggles to sit through his prison-mandated AA meetings. In "The Squirrel and the Chipmunk," a pair of star-crossed lovers is separated by prejudiced family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With original illustrations by Ian Falconer, author of the bestselling Olivia series of children's books, these stories are David Sedaris at his most observant, poignant, and surprising.</description>

  <description>Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this spellbinding novel transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. Her new home is haunted by the ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with bitter poetry and suspense as taut as a rope, &lt;i&gt;Beloved&lt;/i&gt; is a towering achievement by Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison.</description>

  <description>ONE OF TIME’S TEN MOST IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOKS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the searing pages of this classic autobiography, originally published in 1964, Malcolm X, the Muslim leader, firebrand, and anti-integrationist, tells the extraordinary story of his life and the growth of the Black Muslim movement. His fascinating perspective on the lies and limitations of the American Dream, and the inherent racism in a society that denies its nonwhite citizens the opportunity to dream, gives extraordinary insight into the most urgent issues of our own time. The Autobiography of Malcolm X stands as the definitive statement of a movement and a man whose work was never completed but whose message is timeless. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for The Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Malcolm X’s autobiography seemed to offer something different. His repeated acts of self-creation spoke to me; the blunt poetry of his words, his unadorned insistence on respect, promised a new and uncompromising order, martial in its discipline, forged through sheer force of will.”—Barack Obama, Dreams from My Father&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Extraordinary . . . a brilliant, painful, important book.”—The New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A great book . . . Its dead level honesty, its passion, its exalted purpose, will make it stand as a monument to the most painful truth.”—The Nation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The most important book I’ll ever read, it changed the way I thought, it changed the way I acted. It has given me courage I didn’t know I had inside me. I’m one of hundreds of thousands whose lives were changed for the better.”—Spike Lee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book will have a permanent place in the literature of the Afro-American struggle.”—I. F. Stone</description>

  <description>From the outrageously filthy and oddly innocent comedienne Sarah Silverman comes a memoir—her first book—that is at once shockingly personal, surprisingly poignant, and still pee-in-your-pants funny. If you like Sarah’s television show The Sarah Silverman Program, or memoirs such as Chelsea Handler’s Are You There Vodka? It’s Me Chelsea and Artie Lange’s Too Fat to Fish, you’ll love The Bedwetter.</description>

  <description>The bestselling book that asks what dogs know and how they think. The answers will surprise and delight you as Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist, explains how dogs perceive their daily worlds, each other, and that other quirky animal, the human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temple Grandin meets Stephen Pinker in this engaging and informative look at what goes on inside the minds of dogs—from a cognitive scientist with a background at &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than 52 million pet dogs in America today, it’s clear we are a nation of unabashed dog-lovers. Yet the relationship between dogs and humans remains a fascinating mystery, as no one really knows what goes on in the canine mind. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Inside of a Dog&lt;/i&gt;, Alexandra Horowitz fuses her perspectives as both scientist and dog-owner to deliver a fresh look at the world of dogs—as seen from the animal’s point of view. Inspired by her years of living with her own dog, Pumpernickel, who was a constant source of delight and mystery, Horowitz’s mind became filled with questions and ideas. In crisp, clear prose, she draws on her research in the field of dog cognition to give readers a sense of a dog’s perceptual and cognitive abilities—and paints a picture of what the canine experience is like. Horowitz’s own scientific journey, and the insights she uncovered, allowed her to understand her dog better and appreciate her more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Containing up-to-the minute research and providing many moments of dog-behavior recognition, this lively and absorbing book helps dog owners to see their best friend’s behavior in a different, and revealing light, allowing them to understand their pets and enjoy their company even more.</description>

  <description>In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, &lt;i&gt;A Long Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What's your jumping-off point? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maureen&lt;br /&gt;Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say "Excuse me, I was here first." They don't say "You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity." That would be a bit strong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin&lt;br /&gt;I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: "He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed." And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess&lt;br /&gt;I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ&lt;br /&gt;New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Annie loves Duncan — or thinks she does. Duncan loves Annie, but then, all of a sudden, he doesn't. Duncan really loves Tucker Crowe, a reclusive Dylanish singer-songwriter who stopped making music ten years ago. Annie stops loving Duncan, and starts getting her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In doing so, she initiates an e-mail correspondence with Tucker, and a connection is forged between two lonely people who are looking for more out of what they've got. Tucker's been languishing (and he's unnervingly aware of it), living in rural Pennsylvania with what he sees as his one hope for redemption amid a life of emotional and artistic ruin -- his young son, Jackson. But then there's also the new material he's about to release to the world: an acoustic, stripped-down version of his greatest album, &lt;i&gt;Juliet&lt;/i&gt; — entitled, &lt;i&gt;Juliet, Naked&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What happens when a washed-up musician looks for another chance? And miles away, a restless, childless woman looks for a change? &lt;i&gt;Juliet, Naked&lt;/i&gt; is a powerfully engrossing, humblingly humorous novel about music, love, loneliness, and the struggle to live up to one's promise.</description>

  <description>The true story of one family, caught between America’s two biggest policy disasters: the war on terror and the response to Hurricane Katrina. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdulrahman and Kathy Zeitoun run a house-painting business in New Orleans. In August of 2005, as Hurricane Katrina approaches, Kathy evacuates with their four young children, leaving Zeitoun to watch over the business. In the days following the storm he travels the city by canoe, feeding abandoned animals and helping elderly neighbors. Then, on September 6th, police officers armed with M-16s arrest Zeitoun in his home. Told with eloquence and compassion, Zeitoun is a riveting account of one family’s unthinkable struggle with forces beyond wind and water.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Geek Love&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the Binewskis, a carny family whose mater- and paterfamilias set out—with the help of amphetamine, arsenic, and radioisotopes—to breed their own exhibit of human oddities. There’s Arturo the Aquaboy, who has flippers for limbs and a megalomaniac ambition worthy of Genghis Khan . . . Iphy and Elly, the lissome Siamese twins . . . albino hunchback Oly, and the outwardly normal Chick, whose mysterious gifts make him the family’s most precious—and dangerous—asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Binewskis take their act across the backwaters of the U.S., inspiring fanatical devotion and murderous revulsion; as its members conduct their own Machiavellian version of sibling rivalry, &lt;i&gt;Geek Love&lt;/i&gt; throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal, the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene. Family values will never be the same.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;What Is the What&lt;/i&gt; is the epic novel based on the life of Valentino Achak Deng who, along with thousands of other children —the so-called Lost Boys—was forced to leave his village in Sudan at the age of seven and trek hundreds of miles by foot, pursued by militias, government bombers, and wild animals, crossing the deserts of three countries to find freedom. When he finally is resettled in the United States, he finds a life full of promise, but also heartache and myriad new challenges. Moving, suspenseful, and unexpectedly funny, &lt;b&gt;What Is the What&lt;/b&gt; is an astonishing novel that illuminates the lives of millions through one extraordinary man.&lt;br /&gt;-back cover</description>

  <description>A gun is pointed at 21-year-old Ellis as she walks through a New York park. Although she escapes unharmed she is left psychologically reeling. Over the next few weeks Ellis keeps everyone at bay: the police, suitors who want to save her, and the university therapist who hints that her sweaters are too tight. But when Ellis accompanies her mother, a nurse, on a mission in the Philippines, she finds the life - even if held up - cannot be held back, and neither, finally, can she.</description>

  <description>The narrative drive of Stowe's classic novel is often overlooked in the heat of the controversies surrounding its anti-slavery sentiments. In fact, it is a compelling adventure story with richly drawn characters and has earned a place in both literary and American history. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme—the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.</description>

  <description>Sylvia Plath's shocking, realistic, and intensely emotional novel about a woman falling into the grip of insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther Greenwood is brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. In her acclaimed and enduring masterwork, Sylvia Plath brilliantly draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that her insanity becomes palpably real, even rational—as accessible an experience as going to the movies. A deep penetration into the darkest and most harrowing corners of the human psyche, &lt;em&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary accomplishment and a haunting American classic.</description>

  <description>A delightfully original, unerringly hip, yet marvelously practical handbook for a new and slightly cynical generation. You've landed the job. Now you want to make a good impression, express yourself, excel. Unsure of how to proceed? Aspire to a class greater than the one you were born to? Time to put aside your objections to blatant cries for help. In "How to Be Useful", Megan Hustad dismantles the myths of getting ahead and helps you navigate the choppy waters of office life. Drawing on the experiences of twenty- and thirtysomethings (herself included) as well as fictional strivers from "The House of Mirth", "The Apprentice", and everywhere in between, she shows us where things tend to go wrong in our pursuit of the great american dream. Then she culls the best advice from a century's worth of success literature (the books you'd be too embarrassed to read yourself) to show how work and even the idea of professional climbing can be artfully reimagined. The result is both surprising and provocative. There's Andrew Carnegie on why just being yourself on the job is a terrible idea; Emily Post on the importance of asking questions; Napoleon Hill on why its okay to use people (and how to do it properly); Helen Gurley Brown on thriving in the midst of corporate dysfunction; and Stephen Covey on why you shouldn't always stand up for yourself. Proving once and for all that working hard and being smart arent nearly enough to get ahead these days, Hustad provides dozens of solutions for corporate indignities that have stood the test of time. Humorous yet wise, ironic yet indispensable, "How to Be Useful" overturns everything you thought you knew about moving up in the world.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not done with this book, but I would recommend it, even (or especially if) you hate self-help business books. She takes all those books we creative types avoid reading and condenses them into useable, readable bits that you can really apply to your work life.]]>
