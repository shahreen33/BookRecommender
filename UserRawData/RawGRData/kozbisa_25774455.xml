  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this grudge match, the first to score…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When style columnist Matilda Kent accidentally lets slip that she was once involved with the captain of the Sydney Smoke rugby team, she suddenly finds herself elevated to the position she’s always wanted — feature writer. The catch? She’s stuck doing a six-part series on her ex. Still, there’s no way she can turn down a promotion… or the chance to dish the dirt on the guy who so callously broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;…could win it all!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanner Stone wants to be involved in a feature series about as much as he wants to snap an Achilles. But the thought of seeing Tilly again is a bonus — and has him more worked up than he wants to admit. Only he’s not prepared for how different she is — all cool and professional. His Tilly is still in there, though… and he still wants her, now more than ever. All he has to do is charm her into giving him a rematch. And this time, winner takes all!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Love can take root where you least expect it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyson Yang never imagined that one day he’d be the de facto spokesperson for an illegal community garden. But when the once-rat-infested-but-now-thriving Harlem lot goes up for sale, Ty can’t just let all their hard work get plowed under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; irresistibly drawn to the lovely but infuriatingly stubborn real estate associate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magda Ferrer’s family is already convinced this new job will be yet another flop in her small but growing list of career path failures. But her student debt isn’t going anywhere, and selling her uncle’s historic town house and the lot nearby means a chance to get some breathing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty is her charming rival, her incorrigible nemesis, the handsome roadblock to her success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one hot Harlem night blurs the hard line drawn between them, and the seeds of possibility in this rocky garden blossom into love…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 48,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>They’re from two different worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lives in the estate house, and she spends most of her time in the stables helping her father train horses. In fact, Savannah has always been much more comfortable around horses than boys. Especially boys like Jack Goodwin—cocky, popular and completely out of her league. She knows the rules: no mixing between the staff and the Goodwin family. But Jack has no such boundaries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her dream of becoming a horse jockey, Savannah isn’t exactly one to follow the rules either. She’s not going to let someone tell her a girl isn’t tough enough to race. Sure, it’s dangerous. Then again, so is dating Jack…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read an excerpt here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://mirandakenneally.com/2013/04/16/excerpt-from-racing-savannah-coming-in-dec-2013/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://mirandakenneally.com/2013/04/1...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first installment in &lt;i&gt;Hot in Chicago&lt;/i&gt;, a brand-new, sizzling series from Kate Meader that follows a group of firefighting foster siblings and their blazing hot love interests!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savvy PR guru Kinsey Taylor has always defined herself by her career, not her gender. That is, until she moved from San Francisco to Chicago to be with her fiancé who thought she wasn’t taking her “job” of supporting &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; in his high-powered career seriously enough—and promptly dumped her for a more supportive and “feminine” nurse. Now, as the new assistant press secretary to Chicago’s dynamic mayor, she’s determined to keep her eye on the prize: no time to feel inferior because she’s a strong, kick-ass woman, and &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; no time for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that all changes when she meets Luke Almeida, a firefighter as searingly sexy as he is quick-tempered. He’s also the second oldest of the Firefightin’ Dempseys, a family of foster siblings who have committed their lives to the service—if Luke’s antics don’t get him fired first. When Luke goes one step too far and gets into a bar brawl with the Chicago Police Department, Kinsey marches into Luke’s firehouse and lays down the law on orders from the mayor. But at Engine Co. 6, Luke Almeida &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the law. And he’s not about to let Kinsey make the rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My Life in Shambles is an emotional and sexy new standalone contemporary romance from the New York Times bestselling author of A Nordic King and The Pact.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Valerie Stephens made the resolution to say yes to new adventures, she never thought she’d end up in the tiny town of Shambles, fake engaged to one of Ireland’s top rugby players. But there’s a first time for everything.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say bad things happen in threes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After my boyfriend broke off our engagement, I lost my apartment, and was laid off from my job, I can definitely attest to that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They also say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when my two sisters invited me to ring in the new year in Ireland, I decided to throw all caution to the wind and go for it. I was going to let “saying yes” be my new resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know I’d spend New Year’s Eve having a hot and dirty one-night stand with Padraig McCarthy, one hell of a sexy Irishman. I also didn’t know that the brooding and intense sex god was one of Ireland’s top rugby players. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rugby player with a proposition for me: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come with him to his tiny hometown of Shambles and pretend to be his fiancé for a few days, just so that his ailing father can have some peace of mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It sounded simple enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was anything but. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when a town gets up in your business, not when the media hunts you down, not when your past comes back in the picture, not when there are real hearts and feelings at stake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when there are secrets that could break you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my life in Shambles.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Beard With Me’ is the origin story of Billy Winston and Scarlet St. Claire (aka Claire McClure) and is just the beginning of their epic love story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at surviving than Scarlet St. Claire and making the best out of circumstances beyond her control is Scarlet’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, she’d be the last person on earth, hermitting like a pro, singing along to her CD Walkman, and dancing like no one is watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet is clever, Scarlet is careful, and Scarlet is smart . . . except when it comes to Billy Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at fighting than Billy Winston and raging against his circumstances—because nothing is beyond his control—is Billy’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, he’d be the first person on earth to lead others to safety, overcome catastrophe, or die trying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy is fearless, Billy is disciplined, and Billy is honorable . . . except when it comes to Scarlet St. Claire.</description>

  <description>Reed Brennan's future is looking as bright as the two-karat diamonds in her new housemates' ears. Being accepted to the most prestigious private boarding school in the country wasn't enough for Reed. She had to break every rule to do it, but she has accomplished the impossible: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed is a Billings Girl now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with her new status come respect, envy, and, most important, opportunity. Not to mention the parties. Unfortunately, at the next illicit party in the Easton campus woods, her roommate snaps some pictures of Reed in more than one compromising position. She uses the photos to blackmail Reed: Dig up dirt on the most powerful and popular Billings Girls or she will have Reed expelled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of parties, the Legacy is coming up. It's the invitation-only Halloween party in NYC and it's rumored that Thomas -- Reed's MIA boyfriend -- will be making an appearance there. Too bad Reed isn't even close to invited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as a Billings Girl is every bit as glamorous as Reed imagined. What she didn't bargain for is the tangled web of private lies these girls weave.</description>

  <description>The first time you meet someone, you make eye contact. You smile, say hello. Should be simple, if you’re anyone but me. The first time I met Dylan Reed, I found myself making eye contact with a different part of his body. You see, I’m very good at being shy, not to mention extremely well-versed in rambling nonsense and, unfortunately, rather highly skilled at making a fool of myself in front of a guy I’m attracted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, I knew nothing about him and thought none of what I said would matter since I’d never speak to him again. Turns out, I was very wrong. He was the star wide receiver of the football team, one of the few players expected to make it into the NFL, and I ended up seeing him all over campus.&lt;br /&gt;I might have also propositioned him, run away from him, attacked him with a cooking utensil…and…uh, maybe I shouldn’t tell you all of it. It’s pretty normal stuff, things you’d expect…from me. Eventually, the time came when I couldn’t hide anymore—not that he’d have let me even if I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Before now, he never knew I was secretly watching him. Now that we see each other every day, he knows when I have a hard time looking away. It doesn’t help that I’m not the most subtle person in the world either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He smiles at me and tells me he finds me fascinating because of my quirks. I can’t even tell him that I think my heart beats differently whenever he’s around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks we’re going to be best friends. I think I have a big thing for him, and the more I get to know him, the more I don’t care that I’m not allowed to be his friend, let alone fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, that’s exactly what I’m doing—what we’re doing, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard.</description>

      <![CDATA[It's been a while since I've read a straight up NA book, and I enjoyed this. I always love when a hero and heroine have some history, and this was a romance in the making for several years. These two kept turning up in each other's lives, though the timing was never right. I was glad the universe...]]>

  <description>Talia Hibbert, one of contemporary romance’s brightest new stars, delivers a witty, hilarious romantic comedy about a woman who’s tired of being “boring” and recruits her mysterious, sexy neighbor to help her experience new things&lt;em&gt;—p&lt;/em&gt;erfect for fans of Sally Thorne, Jasmine Guillory, and Helen Hoang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Brown is a chronically ill computer geek with a goal, a plan, and a list. After almost—but not quite—dying, she’s come up with seven directives to help her “Get a Life”, and she’s already completed the first: finally moving out of her glamourous family’s mansion. The next items?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy a drunken night out.&lt;br /&gt;Ride a motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;Go camping.&lt;br /&gt;Have meaningless but thoroughly enjoyable sex.&lt;br /&gt;Travel the world with nothing but hand luggage.&lt;br /&gt;And... do something bad.&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not easy being bad, even when you’ve written step-by-step guidelines on how to do it correctly. What Chloe needs is a teacher, and she knows just the man for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redford ‘Red’ Morgan is a handyman with tattoos, a motorcycle, and more sex appeal than ten-thousand Hollywood heartthrobs. He’s also an artist who paints at night and hides his work in the light of day, which Chloe knows because she spies on him occasionally. Just the teeniest, tiniest bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she enlists Red in her mission to rebel, she learns things about him that no spy session could teach her. Like why he clearly resents Chloe’s wealthy background. And why he never shows his art to anyone. And what really lies beneath his rough exterior…</description>

And she wishes that she could lose 20 or so pounds herself so that she could work up the courage to make friends with Wes--the cute new guy at school. She's well on her way to winning big on all counts--until frost and pumpkin thieves attack!</description>

  <description>When Avery Stone learns her dad will be fired if his high school team doesn’t make the playoffs, she has to get her head out of her day planner and do something—anything—to help him win. Even if it means secretly coaching the team’s newest player, who seems to have more game than skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Black just transferred to Hillside with a fake name and a big secret. The MVP of every team he’d played on since he was seven—not to mention the MVP of every post-game party—he can’t understand why since arriving at Hillside, he’s been unable to catch a single. Freaking. Ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until…Avery. Amazing, kind, generous, and crazy-freaking-hot Avery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lucas goes from zero back to hero and Avery struggles with just what Lucas means to her, she inadvertently sets them on a collision course with Lucas’s secret…a secret that could take down not only Lucas but her father too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;DISCLAIMER: This Entangled Teen Crush contains a football player hotter than the Texas sun, hotel cuddles, and a steamy makeout session in the rain. &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Kate has always been the good girl. Too good, according to some people at school—although they have no idea the guilty secret she carries. But this summer, everything is different...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This summer she’s a counselor at Cumberland Creek summer camp, and she wants to put the past behind her. This summer Matt is back as a counselor too. He’s the first guy she ever kissed, and he’s gone from a geeky songwriter who loved The Hardy Boys to a buff lifeguard who loves to flirt - with her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate used to think the world was black and white, right and wrong. Turns out, life isn’t that easy...</description>

  <description>Avery Bardot steps off the plane in Rome, looking for a fresh start. She’s left behind a soon-to-be ex-husband in Boston and plans to spend the summer with her best friend Daisy, licking her wounds—and perhaps a gelato or two. But when her American-expat friend throws her a welcome party on her first night, Avery’s thrown for a loop when she sees a man she never thought she’d see again: Italian architect Marcello Bianchi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcello was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; man—the one who got away. And now her past is colliding with her present, a present where she should be mourning the loss of her marriage and—hey, that fettuccine is delicious! And so is Marcello…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slipping easily into the good life of summertime in Rome, Avery spends her days exploring a city that makes art historians swoon, and her nights swooning over her unexpected &lt;i&gt;what was old is new again&lt;/i&gt; romance. It’s heady, it’s fevered, it’s wanton, and it’s crazy. But could this really be her new life? Or is it just a temporary reprieve before returning to the land of twin-set cardigans and crustless sandwiches?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A celebration of great friendship, passionate romance, and wonderful food, &lt;i&gt;Roman Crazy&lt;/i&gt; is a lighthearted story of second chances and living life to the fullest.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From popular romance author Kate Meader comes the second novel in &lt;i&gt;Hot in Chicago&lt;/i&gt;, a brand-new, sizzling series that follows a group of firefighting foster siblings and their blazing hot love interests!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the only female firefighter at Engine Co. 6, Alexandra Dempsey gets it from all sides: the male coworkers who think she can’t do the job, the wives and girlfriends who see her as a threat to their firefighter men, and her overprotective foster brothers who want to shelter their baby sister at all costs. So when she single-handedly saves the life of Eli Cooper, Chicago’s devastatingly handsome mayor, she assumes the respect she’s longed for will finally come her way. But it seems Mr. Mayor has other ideas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eli Cooper’s mayoral ratings are plummeting, his chances at reelection dead in the water. When a sexy, curvaceous firefighter gives him the kiss of life, she does more than bring him back to the land of the living—she also breathes vitality into his campaign. Riding the wave of their feel-good story might prop up Eli’s flagging political fortunes, but the sizzling attraction between them can go nowhere; he’s her boss, and there are rules that must be obeyed. But you know what they say about rules: they’re made to be broken…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finished PLAYING WITH FIRE? Catch up with Eli, Alexandra, and the rest of the Dempseys in the free &lt;i&gt;Hot in Chicago&lt;/i&gt; short story, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31245450-after-the-fire" rel="nofollow"&gt;AFTER THE FIRE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>All I want is to play hockey on the Ice Knights, instead, I’m in a viral video for all the wrong reasons and my mom—yes, my mom—has taken over my dating apps. Then, when I think it can’t get any worse, the fates deliver Zara Ambrose, a five-feet-nothing redhead with more freckles than inches and who’d rather be anywhere other than on a date with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a bet with her friends and my PR nightmare have us both stuck in this go-on-five-dates-with-the-same-person hell situation. But if we band together, we can get the whole thing over with and go on with our lives. It’s perfect! No feelings. No future. No fuc— *ahem* fun. No naked fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could go wrong? Nothing—as long as I remember the rules. Don’t notice the way she looks in a dress. Don’t react when she does that little shivery sigh thing whenever we touch. Don’t think about the fact that she’s never had a toe-curling orgasm that wasn’t self-delivered and just how badly I want to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five dates—that’s it—and then we go our separate ways. At least, that was the plan..</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A standalone romantic comedy of epically awkward proportions, from New York Times bestselling author, Emma Hart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine this. You’re ready to leave after a one-night stand, and you’re figuring out how to—shock horror—leave your number and ask him to be your fake boyfriend for your sister’s wedding this weekend. When he wakes up. Well, that happened to me. And over coffee and omelets, I found myself a date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which was how I ended up arriving at the wedding with a guy I knew nothing about. I didn’t know his last name, or how we met, or how long we’d been dating. I didn’t know where he grew up, what he’d majored in in college, or how many siblings he had. I sure as hell didn’t know he was Adam Winters, hotshot hockey player—and not only my father’s favorite player, but my little nephew’s freakin’ idol. Which means I’m in trouble. Big, big trouble. My mother is suspicious, my sister is bridezilla on crack, and my grandpa will tell anyone who’ll listen about his time in Amsterdam’s Red Light District. Four days. I have to keep this up for four days, and then Adam and I can return to our regular lives, where we don’t have sex whenever we’re alone and my family aren’t interrogating him over his intentions with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least, that’s the plan. And we all know what happens to those.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Arizona Vengeance is hockey’s hottest new team. But hockey’s hottest goalie is learning that even the best players sometimes need an assist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is clicking for the Vengeance. We may be new, but we’re well on our way to winning the championship, and I’m having the time of my life headlining the sports media as the hottest goalie—hell, player—ever. I for one am going to live up to my name . . . because I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Legend Bay&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragging my ass home from the gym, I’m blinded by some gaudy, glowing holiday lights. As usual, my hot-as-hell neighbor &lt;b&gt;Pepper Nantais&lt;/b&gt; has gone way over the top. But just as I’m about to tell her off, something else catches my eye . . . Seems like Santa left me a present, and not one I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As life takes an unexpected turn, I realize that there’s much more to Pepper than meets the eye. Sure, she’s gorgeous. And exasperating. And her taste in decorating may be a bit . . . unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beneath her carefree demeanor is a fierce determination and a heart of gold. And before I know it I’ve fallen for her. Hard . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepper is exactly the woman I never knew I needed.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shouldn't a girl get to star in her own love story?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Megan Harper is about due for her next sweeping romance. It's inevitable—each of her relationships starts with the perfect guy and ends with him falling in love . . . with someone else. But instead of feeling sorry for herself, Megan focuses on pursuing her next fling, directing theater, and fulfilling her dream college's acting requirement in the smallest role possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she’s cast as Juliet (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Juliet) in her high school’s production, it’s a complete nightmare. Megan’s not an actress, and she’s used to being upstaged—both in and out of the theater. In fact, with her mom off in Texas and her dad remarried and on to baby #2 with his new wife, Megan worries that, just like her exes, her family is moving on without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Owen Okita, an aspiring playwright inspired by Rosaline from Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;R+J&lt;/i&gt;. A character who, like Megan, knows a thing or two about short-lived relationships. Megan agrees to help Owen with his play in exchange for help catching the eye of a sexy stagehand/potential new boyfriend. Yet Megan finds herself growing closer to Owen, and wonders if he could be the Romeo she never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their fresh and funny debut, Emily Wibberly and Austin Siegemund-Broka break down the high school drama to find there's always room for familial love, romantic love, and—most importantly—self-love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of the Nate series by Tim Federle and &lt;i&gt;The Fourteenth Goldfish&lt;/i&gt; by Jennifer Holm will love Cleveland Rosebud Potts in this poignant and heartfelt novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Lily and Dunkin&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleveland Rosebud Potts has a plan. If she can check off the six items on her très important Paris Project List she will make it out of the small-minded and scorching town of Sassafras, Florida, to a rich and cultured life at The American School of Paris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, everything seems to conspire against Cleveland reaching her goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleveland is ashamed of her father and angry that her mother and sister are never around because they have to work extra shifts to help out the family. Her Eiffel Tower tin has zero funds. And to top it all off, Cleveland’s best friend Jenna Finch has decided she’s too fancy for her and her neighbor Declan seems to be hiding something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Cleveland puts her talents to the test, she must learn how to forgive family for their faults, appreciate friends for exactly who they are, and bloom where she’s planted—even if that’s in a tiny town in central Florida that doesn’t even have a French restaurant.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Debut author Alex Evansley delivers a sweet summer romance in this inventive novel about a young heartthrob and teen author falling in love. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teddy Sharpe is kind of famous. He might actually be on his way to being really famous, especially if he'd nailed an audition for the lead role in the movie adaption of the newest bestselling young adult book series. There's just one problem: He totally blew the audition. And he's stuck in a tiny North Carolina airport. And his maybe-ex-girlfriend kind of just broke up with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend isn't exactly looking good until Bennett Caldwell, author of the very book series he just auditioned for, takes pity on him and invites him to her family's lake house. Away from the glitz and glam of Hollywood for a few days, Teddy starts to relax . . . and somehow he and Bennett just click. But dating is hard enough when you aren't the subject of several dozen fanblogs, and the Internet is full of juicy gossip about Teddy and Bennett . . . gossip that Bennett might not be prepared to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chosen by readers like you for Macmillan’s young adult imprint Swoon Reads, Alex Evansley's debut novel, written from both Bennett and Teddy's perspectives, will have teens laughing, swooning, and falling in love along with these fantastically relatable characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Love Scene, Take Two:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A &lt;b&gt;modern, cool, lovable story&lt;/b&gt; that easily makes you swoon.” —SofiaTypes, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;b&gt;This story had me laughing and crying.”&lt;/b&gt; —Basicgrill, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>To be blind is not miserable; not to be able to bear blindness, that is miserable. --John Milton &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Conroy, Juilliard-trained violinist, was on the cusp of greatness when tragedy swooped down on dark wings, crushing her hopes and breaking her heart. The music that used to sing in her soul has grown quiet, and she feels on the verge of setting down her violin for good. To pay the bills, she accepts a job as a personal assistant to a bitter, angry young man who’s been disabled by a horrific accident … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Lake was an extreme sport athlete, journalist and photographer. He roamed the world in search of his next adrenaline high, until a cliff-dive left him in a coma. He awakes to find his career gone, his dreams shattered to pieces, his world an endless blackness that will never lift. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte begins to see that beneath Noah’s angry, brittle exterior is a young man in a pain. She is determined to show him that his life isn’t over, that he has so much to live for, never dreaming that she would become the only light in his darkness, or that he would help her find the music in hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The life he knew is over. The life she wants is just out of reach. &lt;br /&gt;Together, they must face their fears and rediscover what it means to really live.</description>

  <description>From the moment she first learned to read, literary genius Darcy Wells has spent most of her time living in the worlds of her books. There, she can avoid the crushing reality of her mother’s hoarding and pretend her life is simply ordinary. But when a new property manager becomes more active in the upkeep of their apartment complex, the only home Darcy has ever known outside of her books suddenly hangs in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Darcy is struggling to survive beneath the weight of her mother’s compulsive shopping, Asher Fleet, a former teen pilot with an unexpectedly shattered future, walks into the bookstore where she works…and straight into her heart. For the first time in her life, Darcy can’t seem to find the right words. Fairy tales are one thing, but real love makes her want to hide inside her carefully constructed ink-and-paper bomb shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, after spending her whole life keeping people out, something about Asher makes Darcy want to open up. But securing her own happily-ever-after will mean she’ll need to stop hiding and start living her own truth—even if it’s messy.</description>

  <description>Teresa Hamilton is having a rough year—she’s in love with her big brother’s best friend, but he hasn’t spoken to her since they shared a truly amazing, mind-blowing, change-your-life kiss. She got out of a terrible relationship. And now an injury is threatening to end her dance career for good. It’s time for Plan B – college. And maybe a chance to convince Jase that what they have together is real.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jase Winstead has a huge secret that he’s not telling anyone. Especially not his best friend’s incredibly beautiful sister. Even though he and Teresa shared the hottest kiss of his life, he knows that his responsibilities must take priority. He certainly doesn’t have time for a relationship. But it doesn’t help that all he can think about kissing the one girl who could ruin everything for him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they’re thrown together more and more, Jase and Tess can’t keep denying their feelings for each other. But a familiar danger looms and tragedy strikes. As the campus recovers, the star-crossed couple must decide what they’re willing to risk to be together, and what they’re willing to lose if they’re not…</description>

It was really interesting reading this through an adult lens. I always thought Laura was spirited, but she was quite sassy as well. Some of her comments had me laughing...]]>

  <description>When 26 year old Reese accepts a position as a grad assistant, she has no idea an unpleasant encounter with a student will lead to the discovery of what she calls “the trifecta”: fine, intellectual, and a little bit rude – three qualities she finds irresistible in a man. She has no intention of doing anything with that discovery – nothing long term, at least. But everybody knows what happens to best laid plans. &lt;br /&gt;Jason is a grown man. 28 years old, seasoned and scarred by his real-life experience in the world, he’s at Blakewood State University to finish his degree and move on. The last thing he’s interested in is the female population on campus… but sexy, infuriating Reese might be a notable exception. &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a story of opposites attract. &lt;br /&gt;More like counterparts clash. &lt;br /&gt;Neither of them is afraid to do battle, and neither is willing to back down. Love and war, win or lose… somebody’s gonna end up getting schooled. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Quinn Roberts is a sixteen-year-old smart aleck and Hollywood hopeful whose only worry used to be writing convincing dialogue for the movies he made with his sister Annabeth. Of course, that was all before—before Quinn stopped going to school, before his mom started sleeping on the sofa…and before Annabeth was killed in a car accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Geoff, Quinn’s best friend who insists it’s time that Quinn came out—at least from hibernation. One haircut later, Geoff drags Quinn to his first college party, where instead of nursing his pain, he meets a guy—a hot one—and falls hard. What follows is an upside-down week in which Quinn begins imagining his future as a screenplay that might actually have a happily-ever-after ending—if, that is, he can finally step back into the starring role of his own life story.</description>

  <description>It's the first real summer since the devastating accident that killed Cedar's father and younger brother, Ben. But now Cedar and what’s left of her family are returning to the town of Iron Creek for the summer. They’re just settling into their new house when a boy named Leo, dressed in costume, rides by on his bike. Intrigued, Cedar follows him to the renowned Summerlost theatre festival. Soon, she not only has a new friend in Leo and a job working concessions at the festival, she finds herself surrounded by mystery. The mystery of the tragic, too-short life of the Hollywood actress who haunts the halls of Summerlost. And the mystery of the strange gifts that keep appearing for Cedar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Infused with emotion and rich with understanding, Summerlost is the touching middle grade debut from Ally Condie, the international bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Matched&lt;/i&gt; series, that highlights the strength of family and personal resilience in the face of tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;LOVE, STARGIRL &lt;/i&gt;picks up a year after &lt;i&gt;Stargirl &lt;/i&gt;ends and reveals the new life of the beloved character who moved away so suddenly at the end of &lt;i&gt;Stargirl&lt;/i&gt;. The novel takes the form of "the world's longest letter," in diary form, going from date to date through a little more than a year's time. In her writing, Stargirl mixes memories of her bittersweet time in Mica, Arizona, with involvements with new people in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Love, Stargirl&lt;/i&gt;, we hear the voice of Stargirl herself as she reflects on time, life, Leo, and - of course - love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>High school junior Jenny Greenley is so good at keeping secrets that she's the school newspaper's anonymous advice columnist. She's so good at it that, when hotter-than-hot Hollywood star Luke Striker comes to her small town to research a role, Jenny is the one in charge of keeping his identity under wraps. But Luke doesn't make it easy, and soon everyone—the town, the paparazzi, and the tabloids alike—know his secret...and Jenny is caught right in the middle of all the chaos.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Emma Chase, New York Times bestselling author of the Tangled Series, returns with the first installment of the Legal Briefs Series.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a DC defense attorney, Stanton Shaw keeps his head cool, his questions sharp, and his arguments irrefutable. They don’t call him the Jury Charmer for nothing – with his southern drawl, disarming smile and captivating green eyes – he’s a hard man to say no to. Men want to be him and women want to be thoroughly cross examined by him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanton’s a man with a plan. And for a while, life was going according to that plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day he receives an invitation to the wedding of his high school sweetheart and mother of his beloved ten-year old daughter. Jenny is getting married — to someone who isn’t him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's definitely not part of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sofia Santos is a city raised, no-nonsense litigator who plans to become the most revered criminal defense attorney in the country. She doesn’t have time for relationships or distractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Stanton, her "friend with mind-blowing benefits" begs for help, she finds herself out of her element, out of her depth, and obviously out of her mind. Because she agrees to go with him – to The-Middle-Of-Nowhere, Mississippi – to do all she can to help Stanton win back the woman he loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her head tells her she's crazy...and her heart says something else entirely.&lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you mix a one stop-light town, two professional arguers, a homecoming queen, four big brothers, some Jimmy Dean sausage and a gun-toting Nana? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bourbon flows, passions rise and even the best laid plans get overruled by the desires of the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three friends, two love stories, one convention: this fun, feminist love letter to geek culture is all about fandom, friendship, and finding the courage to be yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie likes to stand out. She’s a vlogger and actress promoting her first movie at SupaCon, and this is her chance to show fans she’s over her public breakup with co-star Reese Ryan. When internet-famous cool-girl actress Alyssa Huntington arrives as a surprise guest, it seems Charlie’s long-time crush on her isn’t as one-sided as she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor likes to blend in. Her brain is wired differently, making her fear change. And there’s one thing in her life she knows will never change: her friendship with her best guy friend Jamie—no matter how much she may secretly want it to. But when she hears about a fan contest for her favorite fandom, she starts to rethink her rules on playing it safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Queens of Gee&lt;/i&gt;k by Jen Wilde, chosen by readers like you for Macmillan's young adult imprint Swoon Reads, is an empowering novel for anyone who has ever felt that fandom is family.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“When I met Alec Williams, I nearly fainted. Totally embarrassing, but how often does a regular girl get to meet a famous heartthrob?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felicity has been living in the shadow of her best friend Lucy since they were kids. But things change when she is introduced to a quiet guy named Alec. At first Felicity is intimidated by his fame, but as the two grow closer she starts to realize that Alec just might be the guy of her dreams. No other guy has ever made her feel so alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem? Lucy has different plans for Alec—plans that start with prom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felicity quickly realizes that she will have to make a decision. Will she choose her best friend who has always been there for her, or the mysterious boy that she can't stop thinking about? Whatever her choice, someone is going to be left broken hearted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet... The Queen of Hearts.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;"When I met Oliver Perry, I had no clue he was the lead singer for The Heartbreakers. And he had no idea that I was the only girl in the world who hated his music."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stella will do anything for her sick sister, Cara—even stand in line for an autographed Heartbreakers CD...for four hours. She's totally winning best birthday gift this year. At least she met a cute boy with soft brown hair and gorgeous blue eyes while getting her caffeine fix. Too bad she'll never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, Stella's life has suddenly turned into a cheesy love song. Because Starbucks Boy is Oliver Perry – lead singer for the Heartbreakers. And even after she calls his music crap, Oliver still gives Stella his phone number. And whispers quotes from her favorite Disney movie in her ear. OMG, what is her life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can Stella even think about being with Oliver — dating and laughing and pulling pranks with the band — when her sister could be dying of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Walk Away&lt;/i&gt; is Katherine Center at her very best: an utterly charming, hopeful, and romantic novel that will capture reader’s hearts with every page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Moxie&lt;/i&gt; comes a stunning novel told in three voices about the lies families tell to survive. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, summer begins when the Callahans arrive on Mariposa Island. That’s when Elena Finney gets to escape her unstable, controlling mother by babysitting for their two children. And the summer of 1986 promises to be extra special when she meets J.C., the new boy in town, whose kisses make Elena feel like she’s been transported to a new world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joaquin Finney can’t imagine why anyone would want to come to Mariposa Island. He just graduated from high school and dreams about going to California to find his father and escape his mother’s manipulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Liars of Mariposa Island&lt;/i&gt; follows siblings Elena and Joaquin, with flashbacks to their mother's experience as a teenage refugee fleeing the Cuban revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Mathieu’s multilayered novel explores the nature of secrets, lies, and fierce, destructive love.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s love. Trust me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime on the move, Ivy Snow is an expert in all things temporary—schools, friends, and way too many Mr. Wrongs. Now that she owns a successful taco truck in San Francisco and an apartment to call home, Ivy’s reinvented life is on solid ground. And she’s guarded against anything that can rock it. Like the realities of a past she’s worked hard to cover up. And especially Kel O’Donnell. Too hot not to set off alarms, he screams temporary. If only his whispers weren’t so delightfully naughty and irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kel, an Idaho sheriff and ranch owner, is on vacay, but Ivy’s a spicy reason to give his short-terms plans a second thought. Best of all, she’s a tonic for his untrusting heart, burned once and still in repair. But when Ivy’s past intrudes on a perfect romance, Kel fears that everything she’s told him has been a perfect lie. Now, if only Ivy’s willing to share, Kel will fight for a &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; love story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if America had a royal family? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When America won the Revolutionary War, its people offered General George Washington a crown. Two and a half centuries later, the House of Washington still sits on the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Princess Beatrice gets closer to becoming America's first queen regnant, the duty she has embraced her entire life suddenly feels stifling. Nobody cares about the spare except when she's breaking the rules, so Princess Samantha doesn't care much about anything, either . . . except the one boy who is distinctly off-limits to her. And then there's Samantha's twin, Prince Jefferson. If he'd been born a generation earlier, he would have stood first in line for the throne, but the new laws of succession make him third. Most of America adores their devastatingly handsome prince . . . but two very different girls are vying to capture &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; heart.</description>

  <description>Family can be complicated. Especially when skeletons from the past pop up unexpectedly. For American Evie Gray, finding out her deceased mother had a secret identity, and not one of the caped crusader variety, was quite the surprise. Evie’s mom had a secret life before she was even born, one that involved tiaras.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this modern day fairytale, Evie is on a path to figure out who her mom really was, while discovering for herself what the future will hold. Charged with her late mother’s letters, Evie embarks on a quest into her past. The first item on the list is to attend Oxford, her mom’s alma mater. There, Evie stumbles upon a real life prince charming, Edmund Stuart the second Prince of England, who is all too happy to be the counterpart to her damsel in distress.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Evie can’t resist her growing attraction to Edmund as they spend more time together trying to unravel the clues her mother left behind. But, when doubts arise as to whether or not Edmund could ever be with an untitled American, what really ends up unraveling is Evie’s heart. When Evie uncovers all the facts about her mom’s former life, she realizes her mom’s past can open doors she never dreamed possible, doors that can help her be with Edmund. But, with everything now unveiled, Evie starts to crack under the pressure of new family responsibilities and the realization that her perfect prince may want her for all the wrong reasons.</description>

  <description>Some people might say that Denver had a death wish. Why else would she have dared to sneak into a Malibu beach party where she’d be surrounded by enemies, namely including her ex-BFF Abigail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah. Croix. Denver never thought in a million years he’d ask her out, but who was she to question this miracle of fate? Well, that wasn’t the only surprise fate had in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the party a tsunami hit the coast of California, wiping out everything in its path. Denver and a handful of others escaped death by holding onto the roof of the house and were swept out to sea. Of course, one of her fellow castaways was none other than Abigail, who could barely stand the sight of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that she’s floating in the ocean, stuck on a small boat with the most popular kids in school and waiting to be rescued, Denver wonders what might kill her first-dehydration, sunstroke, or the girl she used to think of as a sister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hilariously dark and twisted story that sparkles with a remarkably fresh voice, The Lifeboat Clique is Kathy Park’s irreverent yet insightful novel about how to survive in the most unthinkable circumstances.</description>

  <description>When Caleb Gray heads to the Texas coast to mentally prepare for a future he isn’t sure he wants, the last person he expects to see is Catie Dixon. Yeah, their mothers have been planning their wedding since they were born, but he and Catie are most definitely not friends. He can’t see her as anything but the annoying kid who followed him everywhere. Except, it’s really bothering him that everyone is staring at her in that bikini…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catie got over her crush on Caleb ages ago. So why can’t she see past his ripped body or how unsettled he seems? She’s got her own problems, though. Her future has been set for years and now she’s dreaming of pulling the plug. A week at their families’ beach house is just what she needs to pull herself together, and she has no intention of letting Caleb back into her heart...which would be a whole lot easier if he’d put on a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a forced week of togetherness full of beach parties, waterslide mishaps, bonfires, and roller coasters sparks more than an understanding. What do you do when the person standing in the way of your future is the one person you grew up hating...but now don’t?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tradition, Honor, Excellence... and secrets so dark they’re almost invisible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old Reed Brennan wins a scholarship to Easton Academy—the golden ticket away from her pill-popping mother and run-of-the-mill suburban life. But when she arrives on the beautiful, tradition-steeped campus of Easton, everyone is just a bit more sophisticated, a bit more gorgeous, and a lot wealthier than she ever thought possible. Reed realizes that even though she has been accepted to Easton, Easton has not accepted her. She feels like she’s on the outside, looking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she meets the Billings Girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the most beautiful, intelligent, and intensely confident girls on campus. And they know it. They hold all the power in a world where power is fleeting but means everything. Reed vows to do whatever it takes to be accepted into their inner circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed uses every part of herself—the good, the bad, the beautiful—to get closer to the Billings Girls. She quickly discovers that inside their secret parties and mountains of attitude, hanging in their designer clothing-packed closets the Billings Girls have skeletons. And they’ll do anything to keep their secrets private.</description>

  <description>A celebration of nonconformity; a tense, emotional tale about the fleeting, cruel nature of popularity--and the thrill and inspiration of first love. Ages 12+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo Borlock follows the unspoken rule at Mica Area High School: don't stand out--under any circumstances! Then Stargirl arrives at Mica High and everything changes--for Leo and for the entire school. After 15 years of home schooling, Stargirl bursts into tenth grade in an explosion of color and a clatter of ukulele music, enchanting the Mica student body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the delicate scales of popularity suddenly shift, and Stargirl is shunned for everything that makes her different. Somewhere in the midst of Stargirl's arrival and rise and fall, normal Leo Borlock has tumbled into love with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a celebration of nonconformity, Jerry Spinelli weaves a tense, emotional tale about the fleeting, cruel nature of popularity--and the thrill and inspiration of first love.</description>

  <description>In the fourth sexy romance by the New York Times bestselling author of Tangled and Twisted, Drew and Kate can’t wait to tie the knot—if they can survive the pre-wedding festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most of my life, I never imagined I’d get married. But Kate did the impossible: she changed me. I think we can all agree I was pretty frigging awesome before, but now I’m even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road to this day wasn’t all rainbows and boners. There were mistakes and misunderstandings worthy of a Greek tragedy. But Kate and I made it through with our inexhaustible lust, boundless admiration, and everlasting love for one another intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there were some unexpected incidents in Vegas last weekend that could have been a problem. It was kind of... my final test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you’re thinking—what the hell did you do this time? Relax. Let’s not judge, or call for my castration, until you've heard the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hold on tight, because you’re in for a wild ride. Did you expect anything less?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a really fun way to end this series. Obviously, things were bound to get a little crazy with this crew in Vegas, and their antics caused fits of laughter for me, but I also liked seeing all those characters we have grown to love celebrating together. This day was a long time in the makin...]]>

  <description>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: girl meets player, they fall in love, player changes his ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a good story. But it’s not our story. Ours is a lot more colorful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I met Dee I knew right away that she was special. When she met me, she thought I was anything but special--I was exactly like every other guy who’d screwed her over and let her down. It took some time to convince her otherwise, but turns out I can make a convincing argument when sex is at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might know where this story’s headed. But the best part isn't where we ended up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s how we got there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamed goes back in time to the Tangled days. But this time around, it’s not Drew dishing out the advice and opinions – it’s his best friend Matthew, who of course is dealing with Dee Dee.</description>

  <description>There are two kinds of people in the world. The ones who look first, and the ones who leap. I’ve always been more of a looker. Cautious. A planner. That changed after I met Drew Evans. He was so persistent. So sure of himself – and of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all love stories end happily ever after. Did you think Drew and I were going to ride off into the sunset? Join the club. Now I have to make a choice, the most important of my life. Drew already made his –in fact, he tried to decide for the both of us. But you know that’s just not my style. So I came back to Greenville. Alone. Well, sort of alone....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I've come to realize is that old habits die hard and sometimes you have to go back to where you began, before you can move ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;TWISTED picks up two years after Tangled’s end, and is told from Kate’s POV.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was really emotional for me. The conflict broke my heart in two. I know the misunderstanding will make some people nuts, but at least both characters were given a chance to explain themselves, and the ending was wonderful. It was great seeing this couple through to the end. <br /><br /><a href="http://weliveandbreathebooks.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow"> BLOG</a> |<a href="https...</a>]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What does Drew Evans have to say next? Find out in this forty page short story, filled with his sexy charm, unique advice and hilarious one-liners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriage: the final frontier. Steven went first. He was kind of our test subject. Like those monkeys that NASA sent off into space in the fifties, all the while knowing they’d never make it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now another poor rocket is ready to launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this isn’t just any posh New York wedding. You’ve seen my friends, you’ve met our families, you know you're in for a treat. Everyone wants their wedding to be memorable. This one’s going to be un-frigging-forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy Frigging Matrimony &lt;i&gt;takes place about a year after Tangled’s end and is from Drew’s POV.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassie Hanwell was born for emergencies. As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she's seen her fair share of them, and she's excellent at dealing with other people's tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to uproot her life and move to Boston, it's an emergency of a kind Cassie never anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie's old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren't exactly thrilled to have a "lady" on the crew, even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the handsome rookie, who doesn't seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can't think about that. Because she doesn't fall in love. And because of the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;don't date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...but will she jeopardize her place in a career where she's worked so hard to be taken seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Center's &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt, affecting novel about life, love, and the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fiercely funny, queer romantic comedy about two girls who can't stand each other, but join forces in a grand feminist hoax to expose harassment and inequality at their elite private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Harriet Price is the perfect student: wealthy, smart, over-achieving. Will Everhart, on the other hand, is a troublemaker who's never met an injustice she didn't fight. When their swim coach's inappropriate behavior is swept under the rug, the unlikely duo reluctantly team up to expose his misdeeds, pulling provocative pranks and creating the instantly legendary Amelia Westlake--an imaginary student who helps right the many wrongs of their privileged institution. But as tensions burn throughout their school--who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Amelia Westlake?--and between Harriet and Will, how long can they keep their secret? How far will they go to make a difference? And when will they realize they're falling for each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning author Erin Gough's &lt;i&gt;Amelia Westlake Was Never Here&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, smart, and all-too-timely story of girls fighting back against power and privilege--and finding love while they're at it.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a great hate-to-love romance. The set up was very girl-power, but what I really adored was what Harriet and Will brought out in each other. It was also interesting (for me) to see these issues though a non-American lens, and I thought the set up was great and utilized really well in the...]]>

  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jasmine Guillory makes her hardcover debut with a heartwarming Christmas romance.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Forest has been out of the country a grand total of one time, so when she gets the chance to tag along on her daughter Maddie's work trip to England to style a royal family member, she can't refuse. She's excited to spend the holidays taking in the magnificent British sights, but what she doesn't expect is to become instantly attracted to a certain Private Secretary and his charming accent and unyielding formality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm Hudson has been the Queen's Private Secretary for years and has never given a personal, private tour...until now. He is intrigued by Vivian the moment he meets her and finds himself making excuses just to spend time with her. When flirtatious banter turns into a kiss under the mistletoe, things snowball into a full-on fling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a ticking timer on their holiday romance, they are completely fine with ending their short, steamy fling come New Year's Day...or are they?</description>

  <description>In a small town in Maine, recently widowed Eveleth "Evvie" Drake rarely leaves her house. Everyone in town, including her best friend, Andy, thinks grief keeps her locked inside, and she doesn't correct them. In New York, Dean Tenney, former major-league pitcher and Andy's childhood friend, is struggling with a case of the "yips": he can't throw straight anymore, and he can't figure out why. An invitation from Andy to stay in Maine for a few months seems like the perfect chance to hit the reset button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dean moves into an apartment at the back of Evvie's house, the two make a deal: Dean won't ask about Evvie's late husband, and Evvie won't ask about Dean's baseball career. Rules, though, have a funny way of being broken--and what starts as an unexpected friendship soon turns into something more. But before they can find out what might lie ahead, they'll have to wrestle a few demons: the bonds they've broken, the plans they've changed, and the secrets they've kept. They'll need a lot of help, but in life, as in baseball, there's always a chance--right up until the last out.</description>

  <description>When a guy named Martin Nathaniel Munroe II texts you, it should be obvious who you're talking to. Except there's two of them (it's a long story), and Haley thinks she's talking to the one she doesn't hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A question about a class project rapidly evolves into an all-consuming conversation. Haley finds that Martin is actually willing to listen to her weird facts and unusual obsessions, and Martin feels like Haley is the first person to really see who he is. Haley and Martin might be too awkward to hang out in real life, but over text, they're becoming addicted to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem: Haley &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; know who Martin is. And Martin doesn't know that Haley doesn't know. But they better figure it out fast before their meet-cute becomes an epic meet-disaster . . .</description>

  <description>I may know everything there is to know about baseball, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Or like him. Garrett Reeves: sidelined player and the embodiment of everything I’ve learned to hate about baseball. He’s gorgeous, he’s cocky, he’s laser-focused on getting back in the game, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he convinces me to call games alongside him, our chemistry heats up the booth. We’re good together, whether I want to admit it or not. I’m finding that I like baseball again, but even worse, I’m liking Garrett. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he has to decide between our future and a new shot at his dreams, I know baseball will win out every time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book has tons of hilarious banter, lots of sexual tension, and a hero who will throw a wild pitch right at your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Rating: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />There was a famous baseball player from back in the day, who I need to steal a line from, because lately, baseball's been very, very good to me.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's a Special Forces veteran making his pro hockey debut. She's a dogged sports reporter determined to get a scoop. She's also his best friend's widow...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans can’t get enough of Levi Hunt, the Special Forces veteran who put his NHL career on hold to serve his country and fight the bad guys. So when his new Chicago Rebels bosses tell him to cooperate with the press on a profile, he’s ready to do his duty. Until he finds out who he has to work with: flame-haired, freckle-splashed, impossibly perky Jordan Cooke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman he should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have kissed the night she buried her husband, Levi’s best friend in the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey-stick-up-his-butt-serious Levi Hunt might despise Jordan for reasons she can’t fathom—okay, it’s to do with kissing—but her future in the cutthroat world of sports reporting hangs on delivering the goods on the league’s hottest, grumpiest rookie. So what if he’s not interested in having his life plated up for public consumption. Too bad. Jordan will have to play dirty to get her scoop and even dirtier to get her man. Only in winning the story, she might just lose her heart...</description>

  <description>Anna and Bennett were never supposed to meet: she lives in 1995 Chicago and he lives in 2012 San Francisco. But Bennett has the unique ability to travel through time and space, which brings him into Anna’s life, and with him a new world of adventure and possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their relationship deepens, the two face the reality that time may knock Bennett back to where he belongs, even as a devastating crisis throws everything they believe into question. Against a ticking clock, Anna and Bennett are forced to ask themselves how far they can push the bounds of fate, what consequences they can bear in order to stay together, and whether their love can stand the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, exciting, and deeply romantic, Time Between Us is a stunning, spellbinding debut from an extraordinary new voice in YA fiction.</description>

  <description>Kate Quinn’s mom died last year, leaving Kate parentless and reeling. So when the unexpected shows up in her living room, Kate must confront another reality she never thought possible—or thought of at all. Kate does have a father. He’s a powerful politician. And he’s running for U.S. President. Suddenly, Kate’s moving in with a family she never knew she had, joining a campaign in support of a man she hardly knows, and falling for a rebellious boy who may not have the purest motives. This is Kate’s new life. But who is Kate? When what she truly believes flies in the face of the campaign’s talking points, she must decide. Does she turn to the family she barely knows, the boy she knows but doesn’t necessarily trust, or face a third, even scarier option?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A romantic comedy that sweeps you up with breezy writing and canny social commentary, set behind the scenes of the classical music world during one hot, anything-can-happen, New York City summer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby has always been &lt;i&gt;Ruby Chertok&lt;/i&gt; future classical pianist, heir to the Chertok family legacy, daughter of renowned composer Martin Chertok. But after bungling her audition for the prestigious Amberley School of Music--where her father is on &lt;i&gt;faculty&lt;/i&gt;--Ruby is suddenly just . . . Ruby. And who is that again? All she knows is that she wants out of the orbit of her relentlessly impressive family, and away from the world of classical music for good. Yes? &lt;i&gt;Yes. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar is a wunderkind, a musical genius. Just ask any of the 1.8 million people who've watched him conduct his own compositions on YouTube--or hey, just ask Oscar. But while he might be the type who'd name &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt; when asked about his favorite composer and somehow make you love him more for it, Oscar is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the type to jeopardize his chance to study under the great Martin Chertok--not for a crush. He's all too aware of how the ultra-privileged, ultra-white world of classical music might interpret a black guy like him falling for his benefactor's white daughter. Right? &lt;i&gt;Right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the New York City summer heats up, so does the spark between Ruby and Oscar. Soon their connection crackles with the same alive, uncontainable energy as the city itself. But can two people still figuring &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; out figure out how to be together? Or will the world make the choice for them?</description>

  <description>He’s a brilliant businessman,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but there’s one thing she can teach him:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how to enjoy the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy’s tried a lot of things. Yoga instruction. Pizza making. So far, none of them have seemed like her thing. Still, she doesn’t have to know where her life is headed to live it with enthusiasm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since his wife’s death, Ryan’s thrown himself into his work. Launching a successful new app will secure his children’s future…even if it means he can’t spend much time with them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a short-term nanny for Ryan’s children, Poppy brings some much-needed fun and laughter. She’s never been one to commit, so why is she feeling so attached to these children…and even more, to their dad? Could it be she’s found her place at last? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This funny, feel-good romance contains a free Hallmark original recipe for Pumpkin Soup with Parmesan Croutons.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Snow-Soon Lee kicks ass--literally. She teaches at her family-owned martial arts gym, The Academy, and cares more about training to be the next Bruce Lee than hooking up. In fact, Snow's never even been kissed. But when Girls Night rolls around, Snow decides to prove to her friends (and herself) that she's not just some boring tomboy. Impulsively, she kisses a hot stranger and even manages to escape his two security guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One stolen kiss…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash Stryker's senior year sucks. His politician father pulled him out of Chariot High, separating him from his championship-winning soccer team. Now he's stuck at a prissy private school with no friends, no team and no chance of being scouted. On top of that, thanks to the death threats his dad's received, Ash has a security tail aka professional babysitters. When the mystery girl from the movies shows up at his school, rappelling from the rafters, Ash knows one thing: he won't let her get away again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting job proposition…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a seemingly random attack, Ash's mother surprises everyone. She hires Snow to be Ash's personal bodyguard until after the election. But can Snow's kick-ass skills hold up against the rising threats to Ash's family? More importantly, can Ash convince his ninja girl to screw ethics and kiss him again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposites attract in this YA romance where a smooth talker meets his match in the tough girl who (literally) sweeps him off his feet. Moral of the story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes even bad boys need a bodyguard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When your name is Wynn, victory’s the only option...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everly Wynn:&lt;/b&gt; As the only daughter in the Wynn family of hockey heroes, I never shared the ice with my brothers—or the approval they got from my father.&lt;br /&gt;And that was before the scandal that ruined my life at sixteen.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I’ve put all that behind me and built a successful career, the last thing I need is another hockey player in my life. &lt;br /&gt;Especially one like Wyatt Bell. &lt;br /&gt;He’s an arrogant, fast-living party boy. I hate how he gets by on his good looks and charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;So why can’t I get him out of my mind?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wyatt Bell:&lt;/b&gt; Life is short, and you’ve got to live it to the fullest. I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;So on the ice, I always play to win, and on the town, fun and flirting are my game. &lt;br /&gt;Because it’s better to laugh your way through the pain than to let them see you’re hurting—but I’ll never stop wishing I could find someone to share the real me with. &lt;br /&gt;Something about Everly Wynn makes me think she could be the one. &lt;br /&gt;But all she sees is a hockey jock hooked on good times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;If she didn’t take herself so seriously, maybe she would take a chance on being happy.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>A ridiculously cute, formerly-famous new guy dropping into your life? It's practically every girl's dream. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not Jules McCallister-Morgan's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that on paper I look like your standard type-A, neurotic, overachiever. And maybe I am. But I didn't get to be the editor of my school's long-revered newspaper by just showing up*. I have one main goal for my senior year-early acceptance into my first choice Ivy League college-and I will not be deterred by best friends, moms who think I could stand to "live a little," or boys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that was the plan before I knew about Alex Powell**.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before Alex Powell betrayed me***.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you're thinking: Calm down, Jules. But you don't understand. This stuff matters. This is my life. And I'm not going down without a fight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Okay, I sort of did. But it's a sore subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I mean, I guess everyone knows about Alex Powell? Two years ago, you couldn't go anywhere without hearing about viral video boy band sensation Chaos 4 All. Two years ago, Alex Powell was famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Some people think I'm overreacting. But this. Means. War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with romance, rivalry, and passive-aggressive dog walking, Amy Spalding delivers a hilariously relatable high school story that's sure to have you falling for The New Guy.</description>

  <description>Alice had her whole summer planned. Non-stop all-you-can-eat buffets while marathoning her favorite TV shows (best friends totally included) with the smallest dash of adulting--working at the library to pay her share of the rent. The only thing missing from her perfect plan? Her girlfriend (who ended things when Alice confessed she's asexual). Alice is done with dating--no thank you, do not pass go, stick a fork in her, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Alice meets Takumi and she can’t stop thinking about him or the rom com-grade romance feels she did not ask for (uncertainty, butterflies, and swoons, oh my!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her blissful summer takes an unexpected turn, and Takumi becomes her knight with a shiny library employee badge (close enough), Alice has to decide if she’s willing to risk their friendship for a love that might not be reciprocated—or understood.</description>

  <description>All seventeen year-old Grace Glasser wants is her own life. A normal life in which she sleeps in the same bed for longer than three months and doesn't have to scrounge for spare change to make sure the electric bill is paid. Emotionally trapped by her unreliable mother, Maggie, and the tiny cape on which she lives, she focuses on her best friend, her upcoming audition for a top music school in New York, and surviving Maggie’s latest boyfriend—who happens to be Grace’s own ex-boyfriend’s father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her attempts to lay low until she graduates are disrupted when she meets Eva, a girl with her own share of ghosts she’s trying to outrun. Grief-stricken and lonely, Eva pulls Grace into midnight adventures and feelings Grace never planned on. When Eva tells Grace she likes girls, both of their worlds open up. But, united by loss, Eva also shares a connection with Maggie. As Grace's mother spirals downward, both girls must figure out how to love and how to move on.</description>

  <description>The Reluctant Royals series returns with a good girl searching for the life that’s not too big, and not too small, and the bad boy prince who might be just right for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya Jerami fled Thesolo for the glitz and glamour of NYC but discovered that her Prince Charming only exists in her virtual dating games. When Nya returns home for a royal wedding, she accidentally finds herself up close and personal—in bed—with the real-life celebrity prince who she loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Johan von Braustein, the red-headed step-prince of Liechtienbourg, acting as paparazzi bait is a ruse that protects his brother—the heir to the throne—and his own heart. When a royal referendum threatens his brother’s future, a fake engagement is the perfect way to keep the cameras on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya and Johan both have good reasons to avoid love, but as desires are laid bare behind palace doors, they must decide if their fake romance will lead to a happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the Naughty Princess Club: a brand new series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tara Sivec that introduces readers to Fairytale Lane and the hilarity—and romance—that ensue when three women start a new business to make it rain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time Cynthia was the perfect housewife. Between being the President of the PTA and keeping her home spotless without a hair (or her pearls) out of place, her life was a dream come true. Her husband was once her knight in shining armor, but now he’s run off with all their money…and the babysitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed as a princess at the annual Halloween block party on Fairytale Lane, she meets two other “princesses” also facing money troubles: antique store owner Ariel and librarian Isabelle. When the women are invited to wear their costumes to a party where they’re mistaken for strippers, Cindy, Ariel, and Belle realize that a career change could be the best way to make their money problems go &lt;i&gt;bippity-boppity-boo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can structured Cindy approach a stripper pole without sanitizing wipes? And could the blue-eyed anti-prince that has been crossing her path become Cindy’s happily ever after? &lt;i&gt;At the Stroke of Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious, empowering story where princesses can save themselves while slaying in stilettos.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Rainy Day Friends&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lost and Found Sisters&lt;/i&gt; returns to Wildstone, California...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke Lemon has always led the life she wanted, wild adventures—and mistakes—included, something her perfect sister, Mindy, never understood. So when Mindy shows up on Brooke’s doorstep in the throes of a break-down with her three little kids in tow, Brooke’s shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to make amends, Brooke agrees to trade places, taking the kids back to Wildstone for a few days so Mindy can pick up the pieces and put herself back together. What Brooke doesn’t admit is she’s just as broken . . . Also how does one go home after seven years away? It doesn’t take long for Brooke to come face-to-face with her past, in the form of one tall, dark, sexy mistake. But Garrett’s no longer interested. Only his words don’t match his actions, leaving Brooke feeling things she’d shoved deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the sisters begin to wonder: Are they lemons in life? In love? All they know is that neither seems to be able to run far enough to outpace her demons. And when secrets surface, they’ll have to learn that sometimes the one person who can help you the most is the one you never thought to ask.</description>

  <description>Colleen Hoover, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Maybe Someday&lt;/i&gt; brilliantly brings to life the story of the wonderfully hilarious and charismatic Warren in a new novella, &lt;i&gt;Maybe Not&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Warren has the opportunity to live with a female roommate, he instantly agrees. It could be an exciting change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or maybe not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when that roommate is the cold and seemingly calculating Bridgette. Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together. But Warren has a theory about Bridgette: anyone who can hate with that much passion should also have the capability to love with that much passion. And he wants to be the one to test this theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Bridgette find it in herself to warm her heart to Warren and finally learn to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Rating: 3.5 Stars<br /><br />It was great getting to know Warren better, and watching him develop real feelings. I did think the sex scenes a bit long given the overall length of the novella, but it was a still a lot of fun. <br /><br /><a href="http://weliveandbreathebooks.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow"> BLOG</a> |<a href="https://www.instagram.com/kozbisa/" rel="nofollow"> INSTAGRAM</a> |<a hre...</a>]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this charming debut about first love and second chances, a young girl gets caught between the boy next door and a playboy. Perfect for fans of To All The Boys I've Loved Before.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mansfield, Massachusetts is the last place seventeen-year-old Edie Price wants to spend her final summer before college. It’s the home of wealthy suburbanites and prima donnas like Edie’s cousins, who are determined to distract her from her mother’s death with cute boys and Cinderella-style makeovers. Edie has her own plans, and they don’t include a prince charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Edie dives into schoolwork and applying for college scholarships, she finds herself drawn to two Mansfield boys who start vying for her attention. First there's Sebastian, Edie’s childhood friend and first love. He’s sweet and smart and . . . already has a girlfriend. Then there's Henry, the local bad boy and all-around player. He’s totally off limits, even if his kisses are chemically addictive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both boys are trouble. Edie can’t help but get caught between them. Someone's heart is going to break. Now she just has to make sure it isn't hers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How do you trust the ground when all you’ve known is flight?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this breathtaking debut, Leigh Ansell has created a compelling, heartbreaking, and truly engaging story about a young girl used to flying high only to be faced with living life with her two feet firmly on the ground . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Corey Ryder can’t remember a time when she wasn’t gliding through the air of Cirque Mystique’s big top. As a trapeze artist in a traveling circus, Corey wakes up every day in a different place, buzzing for the moment she can suspend gravity during the night’s performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the circus pulls into small-town Sherwood, California, everything seems normal—aside from meeting the exceptionally cute Luke Everett at a local diner. But that night, in the midst of the performance, tragedy strikes and flames overtake the tent. While Corey narrowly escapes, in the ashes of the circus pitch lies the only home she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeatedly thrown out of her comfort zone, Corey must learn how to push toward her future without forgetting her past, what it means to be a daughter to a mother she’s never known, and how to navigate the confusing magic of first love, even as she performs the high-wire act of being true to who you really are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Reluctant cheerleader Dallas Bryan has a problem on her hands—and his name is Drayton Lahey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the hot star quarterback of the high school football team hit her car with his motorcycle, he has the annoying ability to get under her skin, making Dallas think about Drayton way more than she should . . . in all the ways that she shouldn't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dallas has one goal—to pursue her dance-school dreams in in California—and no one, not even a hard-bodied, green-eyed football god, will stop her. As the tension between Drayton and Dallas grows thicker, the lines are getting blurred, and all she wants is to come undone under his touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing between Dallas and Drayton could cost her her dreams . . . if he doesn't break her heart first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new series from debut author Lucy Gilmore, featuring service puppies who might just be matchmakers in the making...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Vasquez runs Puppy Promise, a service puppy training organization. Sophie's always been treated as the frail baby of the family—a thing she hates but doesn't know how to change. Until, that is, she meets her newest client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrison Parks is a wildfire firefighter who isn't allowed back in the field unless he finds a service dog. Reluctantly, he agrees, never expecting to be assigned a skittish Pomeranian and the equally skittish woman who's supposed to wrangle them both into order. As it turns out, they all have something to prove…and more than enough room in their hearts for a little puppy love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Feeling cornered at a wedding reception by gossipy guests? Stuck at a holiday party that lasts forever? This beautifully illustrated book is the ultimate funny, sometimes absurd guide to escaping those painfully awkward situations. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in an airplane seated next to a chatterbox? Are you hosting a dinner party with people who just won't leave? Katie Vaz has the key to your escape. &lt;i&gt;The Escape Manual for Introverts&lt;/i&gt; guides readers through different scenarios with themed chapters ("Friends," "Relatives," "Strangers," etc.). Each chapter covers a range of situations, from an invitation to karaoke night to group lunchtime. And she offers a number of escapes for each scenario: bringing odoriferous foods to lunch for a while, having a pet (real or imagined) that "requires" frequent check-ins, and even investing in a jet pack. This book features Vaz's full-page illustrated spreads, hand-lettering, and spot illustrations. From the silly to the sincere, Vaz's clever, hilarious escape plans and bizarre excuses speak to the introvert in all of us. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of an irrepressible girl with cerebral palsy whose life takes an unexpected turn when she moves to a new town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie’s a girl who tells it like it is. That surprises some people, who see a kid in a wheelchair and think she’s going to be all sunshine and cuddles. The thing is, Ellie has big dreams: She might be eating Stouffer’s for dinner, but one day she’s going to be a professional baker. If she’s not writing fan letters to her favorite celebrity chefs, she’s practicing recipes on her well-meaning, if overworked, mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Ellie and her mom move so they can help take care of her ailing grandpa, Ellie has to start all over again in a new town at a new school. Except she’s not just the new kid—she’s the new kid in the wheelchair who lives in the trailer park on the wrong side of town. It all feels like one challenge too many, until Ellie starts to make her first-ever friends. Now she just has to convince her mom that this town might just be the best thing that ever happened to them!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Co-parenting with her best friend. What could go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next three decades of Abby Herbert's life are as carefully planned out as the last three were. Best career ever? Check. Great friends, one of whom she lives with in a stunning Tribeca apartment? Check. Perfect man to share her dream family? Surely just a matter of time. But then she gets devastating news from her doctor--if she wants to get pregnant, she needs to get started on that by...well, &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;. On the bright side, she has the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; person in mind to be the father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tech entrepreneur Marcus Ross has been harboring decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;-friends feelings toward Abby. He doesn't want to lose her and, knowing his feelings are one-sided, he's been trying to move on. When he learns about the curveball Abby's just been hit with, he promises to be there for her however she wants him to be, even if the idea of fatherhood is a little complicated for him right now. But it isn't long until boundaries start to blur, and a deal struck between friends starts to turn into something perilously close to feelings that could change everything...</description>

  <description>As an adventurous send-off to her childhood, eighteen-year-old Tate Jones travels with her grandmother from their small town in Northern California to London. But the vacation of a lifetime is wonderfully derailed by the appearance of two charming Vermont farmers: grandfather Luther and his handsome grandson Sam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam and Tate fall hard and fast. For two glorious weeks, the couple share their hopes, dreams, and secrets. Sam admits he suspects his grandfather is dying and that this could be the last trip they take together, and Tate reveals that she is the hidden daughter of one of the biggest film stars in the world—a secret she’s never told anyone before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Tate is exposed by a crush of cameras and reporters, she knows she's been betrayed by the one person she thought she could trust. She is forced to decide whether she will return to her quiet life or embrace being in the public eye. So when Sam reappears in her world more than a decade later, can Tate forgive the past and rekindle the passion they shared on their magical trip abroad? And does she even want to?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Celebrate Christmas with the ultimate Shopaholic! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brilliant laugh-out-loud festive novel from the Number One bestselling author.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becky Brandon (née Bloomwood) adores Christmas. It's always the same – Mum and Dad hosting, carols playing, Mum pretending she made the Christmas pudding, and the next-door neighbours coming round for sherry in their terrible festive jumpers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now it's even easier with online bargain-shopping sites – if you spend enough you even get free delivery. Sorted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year looks set to be different. Unable to resist the draw of craft beer and smashed avocado, Becky's parents are moving to ultra-trendy Shoreditch and have asked Becky if she'll host Christmas this year. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sister Jess demanding a vegan turkey, husband Luke determined that he just wants aftershave &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;, and little Minnie insisting on a very specific picnic hamper – surely Becky can manage all this, as well as the surprise appearance of an old boyfriend and his pushy new girlfriend, whose motives are far from clear . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will chaos ensue, or will Becky manage to bring comfort and joy to Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER NOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;***** EVERYBODY LOVES SOPHIE KINSELLA: *****&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A gem of a novel' &lt;b&gt;JODI PICOULT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Funny, fast and farcical. I loved it' &lt;b&gt;JOJO MOYES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Life doesn't get much better than a new Sophie Kinsella novel' &lt;b&gt;

  <description>When a determined girl is confronted with the culture of toxic masculinity, it's time to even the score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Michigan Manning lives for hockey, and this is her year to shine. That is, until she gets some crushing news: budget cuts will keep the girls' hockey team off the ice this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If she wants colleges to notice her, Michigan has to find a way to play. Luckily, there's still one team left in town ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The boys' team isn't exactly welcoming, but Michigan's prepared to prove herself. She plays some of the best hockey of her life, in fact, all while putting up with changing in the broom closet, constant trash talk and "harmless" pranks that always seem to target her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But once hazing crosses the line into assault, Michigan must weigh the consequences of speaking up - even if it means putting her future on the line.</description>

  <description>It's 1993, and Generation X pulses to the beat of Kurt Cobain and the grunge movement. Sixteen-year-old Maggie Lynch is uprooted from big-city Chicago to a windswept town on the Irish Sea. Surviving on care packages of Spin magazine and Twizzlers from her rocker uncle Kevin, she wonders if she'll ever find her place in this new world. When first love and sudden death simultaneously strike, a naive but determined Maggie embarks on a forbidden pilgrimage that will take her to a seedy part of Dublin and on to a life- altering night in Rome to fulfill a dying wish. Through it all, Maggie discovers an untapped inner strength to do the most difficult but rewarding thing of all, live.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Printz Honor winner and William Morris Award finalist Jessie Ann Foley’s latest YA novel is a comitragic coming-of-age story about an awkward teenage guy who, after the loss of his brother, finds healing and a sense of self where he least expected to.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the youngest of eight, painfully average Pup Flanagan is used to flying under the radar. He’s barely passing his classes. He lets his longtime crush walk all over him. And he’s in no hurry to decide on a college path. The only person who ever made him think he could be more was his older brother Patrick, the family’s golden child. But that was before Patrick died suddenly, leaving Pup with a family who won’t talk about it and acquaintances who just keep saying, “sorry for your loss.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Pup excels at a photography assignment he thought he’d bomb, things start to come into focus. His dream girl shows her true colors. An unexpected friend exposes Pup to a whole new world, right under his nose. And the photograph that was supposed to show Pup a way out of his grief ultimately reveals someone else who is still stuck in their own. Someone with a secret regret Pup never could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wynn family bonds bend but never break. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;JP Wynn:&lt;/b&gt; I admit, I’ve made some bad choices—on and off the ice.&lt;br /&gt; Now all I want to do is show my team I can control my emotions while I’m playing and redeem myself with my family, especially with my brother, Théo.&lt;br /&gt; I hate that I hurt him and I’m determined to stay out of trouble. &lt;br /&gt; But the hot bridesmaid at Théo’s wedding is tempting me into another bad decision.&lt;br /&gt; A little flirting and a hook up with Taylor seem harmless . . . until Manny Martinez jumps me on the dance floor and starts beating the crap out of me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And just like that I add one more bad decision to my résumé.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Taylor Hart:&lt;/b&gt; I always thought hockey players were hot. Now I think they’re crazy.&lt;br /&gt; Manny broke my heart when he got traded to another team and left without even a goodbye.&lt;br /&gt; Then he showed up at my best friend’s wedding. All I wanted to do was show Manny that I was over him.&lt;br /&gt; And the groom’s sexy brother, JP, seemed more than willing to be my distraction.&lt;br /&gt; But after the way everything went down, I want nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;of them. &lt;br /&gt; Easier said than done. Especially when Lacey’s new brother-in-law is always around. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And I keep thinking about the wedding night, when we snuck away to his room for the best sex of my life.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Kelly Jamieson’s epic Wynn Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PLAY TO WIN&lt;br /&gt; IN IT TO WIN IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s captivating reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Aces Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;MAJOR MISCONDUCT • OFF LIMITS • ICING • TOP SHELF • BACK CHECK • SLAP SHOT • PLAYING HURT • BIG STICK • GAME ON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT • CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT • HOT SHOT • LONG SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy Moore needs a cheap flat, and fast. Leon Twomey works nights and needs cash. Their friends think they’re crazy, but it’s the perfect solution: Leon occupies the one-bed flat while Tiffy’s at work in the day, and she has the run of the place the rest of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with obsessive ex-boyfriends, demanding clients at work, wrongly imprisoned brothers and, of course, the fact that they still haven’t met yet, they’re about to discover that if you want the perfect home you need to throw the rulebook out the window…</description>

Fay’s beautiful, successful and smart, and if he’s being honest, Oliver has always had a bit of a thing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe more than a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geeking out over architectural details is Oliver and Fay’s shared love language, and soon they’re touring pricey real estate across Upper Manhattan as the terribly faux but terribly charming couple Darling and Olly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since being laid off from the job he loved, Oliver has something to look forward to. And for the first time since her divorce, Fay’s having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere between the light-filled living rooms and spacious closets they’ve explored, this faux relationship just may have sparked some very real feelings. For Oliver and Fay, home truly is where their hearts are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twelve-year-old Flor faces a bittersweet summer with a pageant, a frenemy, and a hive full of honey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the summer before eighth grade and Flor is stuck at home and working at her family’s mattress store, while her best friend goes off to band camp (probably to make new friends). It becomes even worse when she’s asked to compete in the local honey pageant. This means Flor has to spend the summer practicing her talent (recorder) and volunteering (helping a recluse bee-keeper) with &lt;i&gt;Candice&lt;/i&gt;, her former friend who’s still bitter about losing the pageant crown to Flor when they were in second grade. And she can’t say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there’s the possibility that Flor and her family are leaving to move in with her mom’s family in New Jersey. And with how much her mom and dad have been fighting lately, is it possible that her dad may not join them? Flor can’t let that happen. She has a lot of work to do.</description>

  <description>The creative writing teacher, the delivery guy, the local Starbucks baristas, his best friend, her roommate, and the squirrel in the park all have one thing in common—they believe that Gabe and Lea should get together. Lea and Gabe are in the same creative writing class. They get the same pop culture references, order the same Chinese food, and hang out in the same places. Unfortunately, Lea is reserved, Gabe has issues, and despite their initial mutual crush, it looks like they are never going to work things out.  But somehow even when nothing is going on, &lt;u&gt;something&lt;/u&gt; is happening between them, and &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; can see it. Their creative writing teacher pushes them together. The baristas at Starbucks watch their relationship like a TV show. Their bus driver tells his wife about them. The waitress at the diner automatically seats them together. Even the squirrel who lives on the college green believes in their relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely Gabe and Lea will figure out that they are meant to be together....&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love burns white-hot in this first scorching romance in an all-new trilogy about a family of firefighters from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Play-by-Play novels and the Hope series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefighter Jackson Donovan doesn't look back—as a rule. So when his past comes roaring back to life in the form of not-so-damsel-in-distress Becks Benning, the last thing he wants to do is relive old times. No matter how tempting she makes it seem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now thanks to his two interfering brothers, Becks is living with them while she looks for a new place and tries to pick up the pieces of her tattoo business that went up in flames. Which means a grown up, smokin' hot Becks is in his house, sharing meals, and digging up old wounds. And despite his better judgement, the more time he spends with this smart, artistic, incredible woman the more he wants her in his bed—and his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becks always had it bad for Jackson. Unfortunately for her, not much has changed—he's still honorable, hard-working, sexy as sin—and closed off. But there's more than one way to get to a man's heart and if Jackson doesn't want to recall old memories, she'll just have to help him make new ones. Because now that she's found Jackson again, she's not letting him go.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Tell Me Three Things&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What to Say Next&lt;/i&gt; delivers a poignant and hopeful novel about resilience and reinvention, first love and lifelong friendship, the legacies of loss, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes looking to the past helps you find your future.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abbi Hope Goldstein is like every other teenager, with a few smallish exceptions: her famous alter ego, Baby Hope, is the subject of internet memes, she has asthma, and sometimes people spontaneously burst into tears when they recognize her. Abbi has lived almost her entire life in the shadow of the terrorist attacks of September 11. On that fateful day, she was captured in what became an iconic photograph: in the picture, Abbi (aka "Baby Hope") wears a birthday crown and grasps a red balloon; just behind her, the South Tower of the World Trade Center is collapsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fifteen years later, Abbi is desperate for anonymity and decides to spend the summer before her seventeenth birthday incognito as a counselor at Knights Day Camp two towns away. She's psyched for eight weeks in the company of four-year-olds, none of whom have ever heard of Baby Hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad Noah Stern, whose own world was irrevocably shattered on that terrible day, has a similar summer plan. Noah believes his meeting Baby Hope is fate. Abbi is sure it's a disaster. Soon, though, the two team up to ask difficult questions about the history behind the Baby Hope photo. But is either of them ready to hear the answers?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Black Dog Bay, a tiny seaside town in Delaware known as "the best place in America to bounce back from your breakup." Home to Better Off Bed-and-Breakfast, the Eat Your Heart Out bakery, and the Whinery bar, Black Dog Bay offers a haven for the suddenly single.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flight attendant Summer Benson lives by two rules: Don’t stay with the same man for too long and never stay in one place. She’s about to break rule number one by considering accepting her boyfriend’s proposal—then disaster strikes and her world is shattered in an instant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summer heads to Black Dog Bay, where the locals welcome her. Even Hattie Huntington, the town’s oldest, richest, and meanest resident, likes her enough to give her a job. Then there’s Dutch Jansen, the rugged, stoic mayor, who’s the opposite of her type. She probably shouldn't be kissing him. She definitely shouldn't be falling in love.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of globe-trotting, Summer has finally found a home. But Hattie has old scores to settle and a hidden agenda for her newest employee. Summer finds herself faced with an impossible choice: Leave Black Dog Bay behind forever, or stay with the ones she loves and cost them everything...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When 16-year-old poetry blogger Tessa Dickinson is involved in a car accident and loses her eyesight for 100 days, she feels like her whole world has been turned upside-down. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrified that her vision might never return, Tessa feels like she has nothing left to be happy about. But when her grandparents place an ad in the local newspaper looking for a typist to help Tessa continue writing and blogging, an unlikely answer knocks at their door: Weston Ludovico, a boy her age with bright eyes, an optimistic smile…and no legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how angry and afraid Tessa is feeling, Weston thinks he can help her. But he has one condition — no one can tell Tessa about his disability. And because she can’t see him, she treats him with contempt: screaming at him to get out of her house and never come back. But for Weston, it’s the most amazing feeling: to be treated like a normal person, not just a sob story. So he comes back. Again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa spurns Weston’s “obnoxious optimism”, convinced that he has no idea what she’s going through. But Weston knows exactly how she feels and reaches into her darkness to show her that there is more than one way to experience the world. As Tessa grows closer to Weston, she finds it harder and harder to imagine life without him — and Weston can’t imagine life without her. But he still hasn’t told her the truth, and when Tessa’s sight returns he’ll have to make the hardest decision of his life: vanish from Tessa’s world…or overcome his fear of being seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;100 Days of Sunlight&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant and heartfelt novel by author Abbie Emmons. If you like sweet contemporary romance and strong family themes then you’ll love this touching story of hope, healing, and getting back up when life knocks you down.</description>

When she had a family that was whole. A boyfriend she loved. Friends who didn't look at her like she might break down at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's just the girl whose brother killed himself. And it feels like that's all she'll ever be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lex starts to put her life back together, she tries to block out what happened the night Tyler died. But there's a secret she hasn't told anyone-a text Tyler sent, that could have changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lex's brother is gone. But Lex is about to discover that a ghost doesn't have to be real to keep you from moving on.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A murderer could be around every corner in this thrilling YA trilogy based on the board game CLUE! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; When a storm strikes at Blackbrook Academy, an elite prep school nestled in the woods of Maine, a motley crew of students—including Beth “Peacock” Picach, Orchid McKee, Vaughn Green, Sam “Mustard” Maestor, Finn Plum, and Scarlet Mistry—are left stranded on campus with their headmaster. Hours later, his body is found in the conservatory and it’s very clear his death was no accident. With this group of students who are all hiding something, nothing is as it seems, and &lt;i&gt;everyone &lt;/i&gt;has a motive for murder. Fans of the CLUE board game and cult classic film will delight in Diana Peterfreund’s modern reimagining of the brand, its characters, and the dark, magnificent old mansion with secrets hidden within its walls.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Cammie:&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since I've seen him. Ten years. I have no idea what he’s doing, where he’s been or if he’s even still single. Have I thought about him over the years? Of course. Absolutely. But that doesn't mean anything, right? Just because you think about the boy you used to be in love with doesn't mean you’re still in love with him now. Does it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dalton:&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t seen her in ten years. She’s the whole reason I’m even coming to this reunion. If it wasn't for her, I would have stayed home. I made mistakes back in high school. Hell, I was just a kid then. But I’m here to right my wrongs, tell her I’m sorry and win her back. She changed my whole life and she doesn't even know it. It’s time she knew.</description>

  <description>Set amidst the breathtaking beauty of Oxford, this sparkling debut novel tells the unforgettable story about a determined young woman eager to make her mark in the world and the handsome man who introduces her to an incredible love that will irrevocably alter her future—perfect for fans of JoJo Moyes and Nicholas Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Ella Durran has had the same plan for her life since she was thirteen: Study at Oxford. At 24, she’s finally made it to England on a Rhodes Scholarship when she’s offered an unbelievable position in a rising political star’s presidential campaign. With the promise that she’ll work remotely and return to DC at the end of her Oxford year, she’s free to enjoy her Once in a Lifetime Experience. That is until a smart-mouthed local who is too quick with his tongue and his car ruins her shirt and her first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella discovers that her English literature course will be taught by none other than that same local, Jamie Davenport, she thinks for the first time that Oxford might not be all she’s envisioned. But a late-night drink reveals a connection she wasn’t anticipating finding and what begins as a casual fling soon develops into something much more when Ella learns Jamie has a life-changing secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, Ella is faced with a seemingly impossible decision: turn her back on the man she’s falling in love with to follow her political dreams or be there for him during a trial neither are truly prepared for. As the end of her year in Oxford rapidly approaches, Ella must decide if the dreams she’s always wanted are the same ones she’s now yearning for.</description>

  <description>When a glamorous red head wishes to locate the son she put up for adoption thirty-two years ago, it seems like an easy two hundred bucks for P. I. Kinsey Millhone. But when a cop tells her she was paid with marked bills, and Kinsey's client is nowhere to be found, it becomes apparent this mystery woman has something to hide. Riled, Kinsey won't stop until she's found out who fooled her and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the widow of the recently murdered P. I. - and Kinsey's old friend - Pete Wolinsky, needs help with her IRS audit. This seemingly innocuous task takes a treacherous turn when Kinsey finds a coded list amongst her friend's files. It soon leads her to an unhinged man with a catalogue of ruined lives left in his wake. And despite the devastation, there isn't a single conviction to his name. It seems this sociopath knows exactly how to cause chaos without leaving a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kinsey delves deeper into the investigation she quickly becomes the next target of this tormentor. But can Kinsey prove her case against him before she becomes the next victim?</description>

  <description>Maxwell has finally met an opponent that he can't best in this new football romance from the author of Fumbled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Brynn Larson, Maxwell Lewis is more trouble than he's worth. She doesn't care if he's a football god with a rock-hard body that brings most women to their knees. After an encounter that ends poorly, she's not interested in giving him a second chance. The last thing Brynn expects is for him to turn up at her bar months later, hat in hand. It doesn't matter if he brings more customers to her business--she's still not going on a date with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxwell knows he made a mistake. He'd been waiting to make his move on Brynn since the day he laid eyes on her and he was finally ready to go for it until he screwed up. He wishes he could tell her the truth about what happened that night, but he just can't. He can't tell anyone, so he'll make amends and hope she'll forgive him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brynn's not like other women, though. Playing for the Mustangs doesn't impress her and gifts make her scoff. Max will have to bring his A game if he hopes to win her over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first rule of this book club:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don't talk about book club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nashville Legends second baseman Gavin Scott's marriage is in major league trouble. He’s recently discovered a humiliating secret: his wife Thea has always faked the Big O. When he loses his cool at the revelation, it’s the final straw on their already strained relationship. Thea asks for a divorce, and Gavin realizes he’s let his pride and fear get the better of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Bromance Book Club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught and desperate, Gavin finds help from an unlikely source: a secret romance book club made up of Nashville's top alpha men. With the help of their current read, a steamy Regency titled &lt;i&gt;Courting the Countess&lt;/i&gt;, the guys coach Gavin on saving his marriage. But it'll take a lot more than flowery words and grand gestures for this hapless Romeo to find his inner hero and win back the trust of his wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A feisty small-town girl and the Hollywood star who broke her heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-consuming love threatened by fame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last chance at FOREVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri Ann Butler's life changed on the night she met movie star, Jack Eversea. She thought she knew a Jack that was very different from the man adored by fans the world over. In the wake of his betrayal and abandonment, Keri Ann has had to pick up and move forward with the life she was supposed to live and has put off far too long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Jack is back, and his explanations for why he left seem more and more plausible, and his declarations more seductive. But being Jack's latest tabloid accessory isn't on Keri Ann's career agenda, no matter how much she is attracted to him. And how can she can ever trust him again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack knows he let the only 'real' thing that ever happened to him slip through his fingers. And his hands have been tied to try and stop it. Until Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack is now fighting to save his relationship with Keri Ann, even as his crazy life threatens to tear them apart. Again. The question is, can he convince her she can have it all? And have him? Forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read how it all began in “Eversea “…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever, Jack is the sequel to Eversea (released June 2013).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Library Journal SELF-e Selection Title 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An orphaned, small-town, southern girl, held hostage by responsibility and self-doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Hollywood A-list mega-star, on the run from his latest scandal and with everything to lose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter that leads to an unlikely arrangement and epic love affair that will change them both forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his co-star and real-life girlfriend is caught cheating on him with her new director, A-list hottie, Jack Eversea, finds himself in sleepy Butler Cove, South Carolina. Jack hopes the sultry southern heat in this tiny coastal Lowcountry town will hide him not only from the tabloids and his cheating girlfriend, but his increasingly vapid life and the people who run it. He doesn’t count on meeting Keri Ann Butler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri Ann has relied on herself so long, dealing with her family’s death and the responsibilities of keeping up her family's historic mansion, that boys and certainly the meager offering of eligible boys in Butler Cove, have never figured into her equation. But fate has other plans. Suddenly face to face with the man who played the movie role of her favorite fictional character, Jack has Keri Ann yearning for everything she has previously avoided ... and Jack must decide whether this funny, sassy girl is worth changing his life for, before his mistakes catch up to him.</description>

  <description>The only child of a single mother, Nina has her life just as she wants it: a job in a bookstore, a kick-butt trivia team, a world-class planner and a cat named Phil. If she sometimes suspects there might be more to life than reading, she just shrugs and picks up a new book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the father Nina never knew existed suddenly dies, leaving behind innumerable sisters, brothers, nieces, and nephews, Nina is horrified. They all live close by! They're all—or mostly all—excited to meet her! She'll have to Speak. To. Strangers. It's a disaster! And as if that wasn't enough, Tom, her trivia nemesis, has turned out to be cute, funny, and deeply interested in getting to know her. Doesn't he realize what a terrible idea that is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina considers her options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Completely change her name and appearance. (Too drastic, plus she &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt; her hair.) &lt;br /&gt;2. Flee to a deserted island. (Hard pass, see: coffee). &lt;br /&gt;3. Hide in a corner of her apartment and rock back and forth. (Already doing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time for Nina to come out of her comfortable shell, but she isn't convinced real life could ever live up to fiction. It's going to take a brand-new family, a persistent suitor, and the combined effects of ice cream and trivia to make her turn her own fresh page.</description>

  <description>Elise carries a notebook full of tallies, each page marking a day spent at her new public school, each stroke of her pencil marking a word spoken. A word that can't be taken back. Five tally marks isn't so bad. Two is pretty good. But zero? Zero is perfect. Zero means no wrong answers called out in class, no secrets accidentally spilled, no conversations to agonize over at night when sleep is far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now months have passed, and Elise isn't sure she could speak even if she wanted to―not to keep her only friend, Mel, from drifting further away―or to ask if anyone else has seen her English teacher's stuffed raven come to life. Then, the discovery of a shocking family secret helps Elise realize that her silence might just be the key to unlocking everything she's ever hoped for...</description>

  <description>There's something totally inconvenient about falling for your best friend's brother. Especially when he's a pompous, arrogant, albeit annoyingly sexy a-hole that you'd like to punch or kiss to death at any given moment. But when he does something unforgivable, will there there ever be a second chance for first love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summer Jazz turns eighteen, a stupid favor will blur the lines from friends to lovers between her and Joey Butler, leading to a summer will change the course of their lives forever. Now for three years they’ve pretended there’s nothing between them anymore and Jazz is finally ready to move on with the rest of her life and from what Joey did to her. But when Joey finally admits that Jazz is the one he's always wanted, all bets are off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full length, standalone contemporary, friends to lovers and second chance romance. It is a spin off from the Eversea series and may therefore contain minor spoilers. This book is recommended for ages 17+ due to strong language and sexual situations.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Lucky loves her grandparents. True, her grandmother forgets things, like turning the stove off, or Lucky's name, but her grandfather takes such good care of them that Lucky doesn't realize how bad things are . . . until she loses her grandfather and is left caring for her grandmother on her own. When her grandma sets the kitchen on fire, Lucky can't hide what's happening any longer, and she is sent into foster care. She quickly learns that some families are okay, and some aren't. And some really, really aren't. None of them feel like home. And they're certainly not family.</description>

Working dead-end jobs and living at home has left him exhausted and uninspired, with little energy to pursue his passion for graphic art. Until he meets Gemma Blackburn, a vivacious out-of-towner from New Zealand. What begins as a one-night stand soon becomes a turning point for Josh. He can't get Gemma out of his head, even after she has left for home, and finds himself throwing caution to the wind for the first time in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not long before Josh is headed to New Zealand with only a backpack, some cash, and Gemma's name to go on. But when he finally tracks her down, he finds his adventure is only just beginning. Equally infatuated, Gemma leads him on a whirlwind tour across the beautiful country, opening Josh up to life, lust, love, and all the messy heartache in between. Because, when love drags you somewhere, it might never let go even when you know you have to say goodbye.</description>

  <description>Their lesson plans didn't include love. But that's about to change...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Martin Krause arrives at Rose Owens's high school, she's determined to remain chilly with her new colleague. Unfriendly? Maybe. Understandable? Yes, since a loathsome administrator gave Rose's beloved world history classes to Martin, knowing it would hurt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keeping her distance from a man as warm and kind as Martin will prove challenging, even for a stubborn, guarded ice queen. Especially when she begins to see him for what he truly is: a man who's never been taught his own value. Martin could use a good teacher--and luckily, Rose is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose has her own lessons--about trust, about vulnerability, about her past--to learn. And over the course of a single school year, the two of them will find out just how hot it can get when an ice queen melts.</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the reasons I jumped at the opportunity to read this book was because it was a "seasoned" romance, which really means, it was a love story between two older characters. I was recently lamenting the fact, that we have no shortage of heroes in their 40s, but for some reason, there are very f...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One young woman’s journey to find her place in the world as the carefully separated strands of her life — family, money, school, and love — begin to overlap and tangle.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All sixteen-year-old Izzy Crawford wants is to feel like she really belongs somewhere. Her father, a marine, died in Iraq six years ago, and Izzy’s moved to a new town nearly every year since, far from the help of her extended family in North Carolina and Puerto Rico. When Izzy’s hardworking mom moves their small family to Virginia, all her dreams start clicking into place. She likes her new school—even if Izzy is careful to keep her scholarship-student status hidden from her well-to-do classmates and her new athletic and popular boyfriend. And best of all: Izzy’s family has been selected by Habitat for Humanity to build and move into a brand-new house. Izzy is &lt;i&gt;this close &lt;/i&gt;to the community and permanence she’s been searching for, until all the secret pieces of her life begin to collide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Build a Heart&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Izzy’s journey to find her place in the world and her discovery that the choices we make and the people we love ultimately define us and bring us home.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will Dimple and Rishi find their happily ever after? Find out in this funny, romantic, endlessly charming e-novella sequel to the New York Times bestseller When Dimple Met Rishi!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple Shah has a lot of opinions about marriage, but they boil down to this: It’s not for her. Sure, she loves her boyfriend, Rishi, but why does she need to validate that with an institution that has historically never favored the woman? Why go through all that hassle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel deeply disagrees. He believes in the power that comes with combining love and tradition, and when the time comes, wants nothing more than to honor those things in a huge celebration with his friends and family. He knows Dimple loves him, but in hearing her rant about how marriage is a “construct of hegemonic masculinity” for the millionth time, a small, niggling part of him worries that it’s not the institution of marriage Dimple has a problem with; maybe it’s him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lovebirds find themselves at a philosophical impasse. Can they find a way to work it out, or does kismet have other plans?</description>

  <description>A love so epic, no label is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Sato’s got labels. Tourettes, ADHD, SPD - words that have defined his existence since the time he was old enough to know what they meant. Now, Van wants to prove he’s more than an acronym, a syndrome, a problem kid. He takes a summer job as a day camp counselor to prove he’s capable of independence and moving on to the next phase in his life. Maybe, he might even make a friend while there. Someone who’s got just as many or even more labels than him. Someone who understands what it’s like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabby Dubanowksi wants to forget about everything, the hospitalization, the judgment, the whispers behind her back. As a camp counselor, she will be admired, looked up to, and able to help people who don’t know anything about her old life. Tabby wants a fresh start and a chance to re-ignite her passion for film-making, if only for one summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running away from their pasts, Van and Tabby collide in a storm cloud of attraction laced with self-doubt, insecurity, shame, and blame. Now, with Van feeling like he might have to quit his job, and Tabby struggling to quell the urge to cut, they will struggle to find themselves in a world designed to keep them apart.</description>

  <description>From the author of SHUFFLE, REPEAT and SUMMER UNSCRIPTED comes a new novel about mysterious boys, first-time love, heartbreak, and the incredible bonds of friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17-year old Lark knows how to survive high school dating: date boys briefly, let them down gently, remain friends, and move on. Her best friends, Copper and Katie, think that Lark is denying herself the opportunity for true love because she does not want to be hurt. They challenge her to break her pattern by staying in a relationship long enough for Lark — or the boy — to fall in love. Intrigued by the challenge, Lark sets her sights on the mysterious new boy, Ardy, who has been labeled “undateable” by the other girls in school. Lark is curious about, and then completely intrigued by, the enigmatic Ardy — so much so that she finds herself falling for him, only to risk having her own heart completely broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen Klein has once again crafted a funny, contemporary story sure to resonate with teen readers.</description>

Her dating style was clear: she picked them, reeled them in, and made them break up with her before any real feelings were involved. It was working for her, or at least she thought it was.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A high school outcast spends his life hoping to be abducted by aliens in this funny, quirky novel about finding your footing in a world that sometimes feels like Mars. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced his mother has been abducted by aliens, Charlie Dickens spends his nights with an eye out for UFOs, hoping to join her. After all, she said the aliens would come back for him. Charlie will admit that he doesn’t have many reasons to stick around; he doesn’t get along well with his father, he’s constantly bullied at school and at work, and the only friend he has is his 600-pound neighbor Geoffrey, and Geoffrey’s three-legged dog, Tickles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlie meets popular, easy-going Seth, who shows him what real friendship is all about. For once, he finds himself looking around at the life he’s built, rather than looking up. But sooner than he expected, Charlie has to make a decision: should he stay or should he go?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love runs wild at the Sagebrush Flats Zoo...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a bid to revitalize his career, bestselling author Magnus Gray has come to Sagebrush Flats to write about the local zoo's latest rescue―an orphaned baby polar bear. But Magnus dreads the drama of small towns and is bullishly determined to keep to himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June Winters is a people person, and delights in welcoming Magnus to Sagebrush Flats, though it seems unlikely she can get the handsome stranger to crack a smile. Then a mishap with an open gate forces Magnus and June to deal with a stampeding flock of fainting goats, an adorable but clingy polar bear cub, a cranky pregnant camel, and two star-crossed honey badgers. Never mind small town drama―the lively animals may just convince these two that opposites really do attract...</description>

  <description>Aiden Emerson is an all-star pitcher and the all-around golden boy of Riverton. Or at least he was, before he quit the team the last day of junior year without any explanation. How could he tell people he's losing his vision at seventeen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight-laced Olivia thought she had life all figured out. But when her dream internship falls apart, her estranged mother comes back into her life, and her long-time boyfriend ghosts her right before summer break, she's starting to think fate has a weird sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each struggling to find a new direction, Aiden and Olivia decide to live summer by chance. Every fleeting adventure and stolen kiss is as fragile as a coin flip in this heartfelt journey to love and self-discovery from the author of Love Songs &amp;amp; Other Lies.</description>

  <description>Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend. I can’t stand him. Well, that’s not strictly true, at night I see a side of him that no one else does. Every night Liam becomes my safe haven, my protector, the one to chase the demons of my abusive childhood away and hold all the broken pieces of me together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s cocky, he’s arrogant, and he’s also some sort of playboy in training. With his ‘hit it and quit it’ mentality, he’s the last person you’d want to fall in love with. I only wish someone had told my heart that…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The international bestselling novel, and finalist of the Goodreads choice awards YA fiction 2012. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can the golden boy of Copper Ridge, Oregon, get a second chance at happy-ever-after? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranching heir Colton West knew his wedding would be the talk of the town. But he didn't expect to get left at the altar—or to escape on the next flight to Vegas with Lydia Carpenter, the woman who gets under his skin like no one else. The only thing crazier than honeymooning with Lydia is waking up married to her. So why does he find himself entertaining his new wife's desire to stay married—and fantasizing about a real wedding night? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Copper Ridge's prospective mayor, Lydia can't risk a divorce scandal so close to election time. But pretending to be blissfully in love with her new husband is more confusing than she'd thought. For a man who's always rubbed her the wrong way, Colton suddenly seems to know exactly what to do with his hands. And his lips. Now Lydia's wildest mistake could turn out to be her luckiest move, if they're both willing to take the ultimate gamble…</description>

  <description>In the rolling hills of beautiful Exmoor, there’s a barn. And in that barn, you’ll find Dan. He’s a maker of exquisite harps - but not a great maker of conversation. He’s content in his own company, quietly working and away from social situations that he doesn’t always get right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day, a cherry-socked woman stumbles across his barn and the conversation flows a little more easily than usual. She says her name’s Ellie, a housewife, alone, out on her daily walk and, though she doesn’t say this, she looks sad. He wants to make her feel better, so he gives her one of his harps, made of cherry wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before they know it, this simple act of kindness puts them on the path to friendship, big secrets, pet pheasants and, most importantly, true love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adventure and discover with the bold and intrepid Becket Branch when her family’s move from city to a country farm means big changes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is changing for Becket Branch. From subways to sidewalks to safety rules, Becket is a city kid born and raised. Now the Branch family is trading urban bustle for big green fields and moving to Gran’s farm, where Becket has to make sense of new routines from feeding animals to baling hay. And as much as Becket loves to yell “Beautiful Alert!” there’s a lot about the countryside that is just plain odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Becket is ready to put her own spin on country life. Whether selling her mouth-puckering lemonade, feeding hostile hens, or trying to make a best friend of her new neighbor Frieda Franca, Becket is determined to use her city smarts to get a grip on farm living. Laugh and learn with Becket as she mucks through the messy, exuberant human experience of change she didn’t ask for, in a story that sparkles with quirky characters and lasting connections.</description>

  <description>Jennifer Donaldson is back with another twisted thriller perfect for fans of One of Us Is Lying and Gone Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zahra Gaines is missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three long years away, Ruthie Hayden arrives in her hometown of Anchorage, Alaska to this devastating news. Zahra was Ruthie's best friend--the only person who ever really understood her--and she vows to do whatever it takes to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zahra vanished from a party just days before Ruthie's return, but the more people she talks to, the more she realizes that the Zahra she knew disappeared long before that fateful night. Gone is the whimsical, artistic girl who loved books and knew Ruthie's every secret. In her place is an athlete, a partier, a girl with secrets of her own. Darker still are the rumors that something happened to Zahra while Ruthie was gone, something that changed her forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ruthie desperately tries to piece together the truth, she falls deeper and deeper into her friend's new world, circling closer to a dangerous revelation about what Zahra experienced in the days before her disappearance--one that might be better off buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her stunning follow-up to Lies You Never Told Me, Jennifer Donaldson once again delivers a propulsive thriller with a masterful twist, skillfully creating a world where nothing is quite as it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel Gibson returns with this dazzling love story filled with sizzle, sass, and just a bit of southern charm...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hello, Ms. Vivian . . . it's been a long time."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with those words, Vivian Leigh Rochet nearly melted. It's been years since she last saw Henry Whitley-Shuler. She was a teenager scrubbing houses for a living. He was the gorgeous son of rich parents, not fit for the likes of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian had vowed to get out of Charleston, become a big Hollywood star, and stick it to the snooty girls who made her cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She got what she wanted—and more—but why does her glamorous life seem so trivial?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry got out too . . . making it all the way to Wall Street, until a heart attack forced him to trade in his cufflinks for a good set of hand tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making furniture soothes his soul, but escaping the Whitley-Shuler heritage is nearly impossible. And now he's come face-to-face with the one who got away. He's not looking for love. He's not even looking for sex . . . so why is resisting her the hardest thing he's ever done?</description>

I liked that there was a lot of history between the hero and the heroine, but there were a LOT of skeletons in those closets too. All I'm going to say is: I knew and I saw that...]]>

  <description>A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister, Scarlett, from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn’t yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend’s true name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only chance of uncovering Legend’s identity is to win Caraval, so Tella throws herself into the legendary competition once more—and into the path of the murderous heir to the throne, a doomed love story, and a web of secrets…including her sister's. Caraval has always demanded bravery, cunning, and sacrifice, but now the game is asking for more. If Tella can’t fulfill her bargain and deliver Legend’s name, she’ll lose everything she cares about—maybe even her life. But if she wins, Legend and Caraval will be destroyed forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome, welcome to Caraval . . . the games have only just begun.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Lauren Layne comes the second delightfully charming installment in the Central Park Pact series, following a young widow whose newfound cynicism about love is challenged by a sexy, rough-around-the-edges contractor. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s never a bad time to fall in love in the city, right? Wrong. According to the recently-widowed Claire Hayes, it’s very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; wrong. In fact, after finding out her late husband was a liar and a cheat, Claire’s convinced there’s never a good time for romantic notions. Determined to rid her home of anything that reminds her of her philandering husband, Claire sets out to redesign her entire Upper East Side brownstone and make it her own. But when she meets gruff and often-cantankerous contractor Scott Turner and realizes not all men are scumbags, Claire must decide if she’s ready to risk her heart again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Scott needs a change of pace from the corporate offices and swanky hotels he’s been building lately, and bluntly makes it clear to Claire that he only took on her house for that reason, adding that he has no patience for a pampered, damaged princess on his job site. But when long work days soon turn into even longer nights, their mutual wariness morphs into something more complicated—a grudging respect, and maybe even attraction…? Scott knows he’s not one to settle down, but then why can’t he bring himself to put the finishing touches on Claire’s house and move on to the next job?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Filled with laugh-out-loud scenes that blend perfectly with the touching friendships Layne brings to life on the page, this “hugely entertaining” (&lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt;) novel is perfect for fans of Lauren Weisberger.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A boy who spent three days trapped in a well tries to overcome his PTSD and claustrophobia so he can fulfill his dream of becoming a famous chef.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he was four years old, Sam Abernathy was trapped at the bottom of a well for three days, where he was teased by a smart-aleck armadillo named Bartleby. Since then, his parents plan every move he makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sam doesn’t like their plans. He doesn’t want to go to MIT. And he doesn’t want to skip two grades, being stuck in the eighth grade as an eleven-year-old with James Jenkins, the boy he’s &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; pushed him into the well in the first place. He wants to be a chef. And he’s going to start by entering the first annual Blue Creek Days Colonel Jenkins Macaroni and Cheese Cook-Off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, if he can survive eighth grade, and figure out the size of the truth that has slipped Sam’s memory for seven years.</description>

  <description>When Marlowe gets a heart transplant and a second chance at life, all she wants to do is to thank her donor’s family. Maybe then she can move on. Maybe then she’ll discover who she is if she’s no longer The Dying Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with a little brother who dresses like every day is Halloween, a vegan warrior for a mother, and an all-out war with the hot butcher’s apprentice next door, Marlowe’s life is already pretty complicated. And her second chance is about to take an unexpected turn...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bachelor &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;The Runaway Bride&lt;/i&gt; in this addictive romance novel about a reality TV producer falling for her would-be star: a Montana heartthrob who wants nothing to do with the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jordan Carpenter thinks she’s finally found the perfect candidate for &lt;i&gt;Jilted,&lt;/i&gt; a new dating show about runaway grooms: firefighter Luke Elliott, a known player who’s left not one but &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; brides at the altar. The only problem? Luke refuses to answer Jordan’s emails or return her calls. Which is how she ends up on a flight to Montana to recruit him in person. It’s not Manhattan, but at least the locals in Lucky Hollow seem friendly . . . except for Luke, who’s more intense—and way hotter—than the slick womanizer Jordan expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eager to put the past behind him, Luke has zero intention of following this gorgeous, fast-talking city girl back to New York. But before he can send her packing, Jordan’s everywhere: at his favorite bar, the county fair, even his exes’ book club. Annoyingly, everyone in Lucky Hollow seems to like her—and deep down, she’s starting to grow on him too. But the more he fights her constant pestering, the more Luke finds himself wishing that Jordan would kick off her high heels and make herself comfortable in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The I Do, I Don’t novels each have their own enchanting HEAs, and can be read in any order.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>ABIGAIL DARLINGTON IS AWKWARD… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She will never be “that” girl. You know the one: that girl on campus, confident in her own skin. Always saying the right things. Putting herself out there. Knows how to talk to a guy without stammering. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope. Shy but clever, and easily embarrassed, Abby is fine being the wallflower in her circle of outgoing, beautiful friends; she would rather read about a sexy book boyfriend than actually have a live, breathing one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…BUT CALEB LOCKHART IS WORSE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Star goaltender for the University’s hockey team, Caleb is quiet and broody, preferring the solitude of his orderly, regimented life. He doesn’t like, or need people—and plans to keep it that way. One more year left of hockey and he’ll be long gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AWKWARD NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both their lives change the day that Abigail falls for Caleb. Well, falls directly on top of him, to be accurate. Because sometimes we don’t settle into love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We fall there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This book contains cursing, and LOTS of it. It also has sex, uncomfortable sexual situations, and secondary characters who say some really inappropriate shit. RATING: R</description>

  <description>7 hours, 9 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s a Wall Street wolf. She’s been hired to tame him. From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne comes a wildly sexy novel of business and pleasure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight and filthy rich, Matt Cannon is the youngest broker on Wall Street. He may be a “boy wonder,” but he’s every inch a man. Ask any woman—any night. But when Matt’s latest fling makes scandalous headlines, his clients get anxious, and his bosses at Wolfe Investments level an ultimatum: keep his assets zipped, get a “real” girlfriend, and clean up his act. Only one woman can help Matt with something this hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For PR genius Sabrina Cross, the best fixer in Manhattan, playing Matt’s steady is going to be a challenge, even if it’s just for show. They already have an explosive history, she can’t stand the cocky party boy, and worse—she can’t stop thinking about him. So who’ll dare to break her “no touching” rule first? Because when that happens, Matt and Sabrina’s game of &lt;i&gt;let’s pretend&lt;/i&gt; will get so hot it could set both their reputations on fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“The Silence Between Us is eminently un-put-down-able.” (&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a great YA contemporary (clean) romance that follows Maya as she navigates a new school and plans for her future. The addition of representation by a Deaf character was really beautifully done. Highly recommend for people looking for a sweet, engaging, and educational romantic read.” (&lt;em&gt;YA and Kids Book Central&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#OwnVoices YA novel features Deaf / Hard of Hearing Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s time we see more Deaf characters in books. It’s time we see more books celebrating sign language and Deaf culture,” said author Alison Gervais.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deaf teen Maya moves across the country and must attend a hearing school for the first time. As if that wasn’t hard enough, she also has to adjust to the hearing culture, which she finds frustrating—and also surprising when some classmates, including Beau Watson, take time to learn ASL. As Maya looks past graduation and focuses on her future dreams, nothing, not even an unexpected romance, will not derail her pursuits. But when people in her life—Deaf and hearing alike—ask her to question parts of her Deaf identity, Maya stands proudly, never giving in to the idea that her Deafness is a disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Silence Between Us&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features a Deaf protagonist and an #OwnVoices perspective on Deaf and Hard of Hearing culture&lt;br /&gt;Is a clean YA romance by Wattpad sensation Alison Gervais&lt;br /&gt;Is perfect for fans of Nicola Yoon and CeCe Bell</description>

  <description>American Angie Donovan has never wanted much. When you grow up getting bounced from foster home to foster home, you learn not to become attached to anything, anyone, or any place. But it only took her two days to fall in love with Australia. With her visa clock ticking, surely she can fall in love with an Australian—and get hitched—in two months. Especially if he’s as hot and funny as her next-door neighbor…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jace Walters has never wanted much—except a bathroom he didn’t have to share. The last cookie all to himself. And solitude. But when you grow up in a family of seven, you can kiss those things goodbye. He’s &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; living alone and working on his syndicated comic strip in privacy. Sure, his American neighbor is distractingly sexy and annoyingly nosy, but she’ll be gone in a few months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except now she’s determined to find her perfect match by checking out every eligible male in the town, and her choices are even more distracting. So why does it suddenly feel like he—and his obnoxious tight-knit family, and even these two wayward dogs—could be exactly what she needs?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Who needs mistletoe?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people wouldn't think of a bad Santa case as the perfect Christmas gift. Then again, Molly Malone, office manager at Hunt Investigations, isn't most people, and she could really use a distraction from the fantasies she's been having since spending the night with her very secret crush, Lucas Knight. Nothing happened, not that Lucas knows that — but Molly just wants to enjoy being a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;naughty for once...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey and pain meds for almost-healed bullet wounds don't mix. Lucas needs to remember that next time he's shot on the job, which may be sooner rather than later if Molly's brother, Joe, finds out about them. Lucas can't believe he's drawing a blank on his (supposedly) passionate tryst with Molly, who's the hottest, smartest, strongest woman he's ever known. Strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he's been assigned to babysit her on her first case. And hot enough to melt his cold heart this Christmas.</description>

The banter between these two was fantastic, and no doubt, there was great chemistry, but there was a lot more to them then just their physical attraction. <br /><br />Molly aspired to be an investigator for Hunt, but due...]]>

  <description>Small-town Wisconsin high school senior Allison Smith loves her life the way it is-spending quality time with her widowed father and her tight-knit circle of friends, including best friend Marian and maybe-more-than-friends Neil. Sure she is stressed out about college applications . . . who wouldn't be? In a few short months, everything's going to change, big time.&lt;br /&gt;But when Ally files her applications, they send up a red flag . . . because she's not Allison Smith. And Ally's-make that Amanda's-ordinary life is suddenly blown apart. Was everything before a lie? Who will she be after? And what will she do as now comes crashing down around her?</description>

Setting up shop to work on custom motorcycles and pass the time, Brady has no intention of letting anyone get close—until he meets Megan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pastry shop owner Megan Lee is drawn to quiet, brooding Brady. Their connection is undeniable, and it quickly develops from physical attraction into something much stronger. But with Brady putting up barriers, Megan is afraid to truly open her heart—unless she can convince him to let go of the past…</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Love After All&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; and the Play-by-Play series delivers a new novel about how love sometimes has plans of its own.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having left his hometown of Hope years ago, only one thing could persuade architect Reid McCormack to come home for a lengthy stay—the challenge of renovating a historic building. But once the job is finished, he’ll be headed back to Boston, no matter how much he’s drawn to beautiful florist Samantha Reasor.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha watches over her elderly grandmother and pours a piece of herself into every floral creation she designs. Her crush on Reid has been blooming for a while now, but she’s reluctant to act on it. A temporary fling isn’t what she’s looking for, even if Reid is smoking hot and super sexy. She wants a real, permanent, forever kind of love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people with different goals couldn’t possibly work, and yet as their attraction grows into something deeper, maybe falling in love is the one thing Samantha and Reid can build a future on.</description>

  <description>Amber Appleton lives in a bus. Ever since her mom's boyfriend kicked them out, Amber, her mom, and her totally loyal dog, Bobby Big Boy (aka Thrice B) have been camped out in the back of Hello Yellow (the school bus her mom drives). Still, Amber, the self-proclaimed princess of hope and girl of unyielding optimism, refuses to sweat the bad stuff. But when a fatal tragedy threatens Amber's optimism—and her way of life, can Amber continue to be the rock star of hope? With an oddball cast of characters, and a heartwarming, inspiring story, this novel unveils a beautifully beaten-up world of laughs, loyalty, and hard-earned hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition of ISBN 9781948705448.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Beau LeFrancois's mother wrecks Bett Diaz’s luxury SUV, his family faces an impossibly large bill—with no car insurance to help pay it. To pay off the debt, Beau spends his weekends working at the Diaz Ranch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau’s prepared to work, but he’s definitely not prepared for the infamous temper of Bett Diaz, also known as "The Beast" at school. As Beau learns the secrets behind Bett’s tough exterior, he finds himself falling for her . . . until he catches Bett in a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A contemporary twist on a classic fairy tale, Beau and Bett is a timely story of family, friendship, and the power of speaking out and standing up for yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days&lt;/i&gt; gets a millennial makeover in this romantic comedy by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Andie J. Christopher.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Nolan is a gentleman, a journalist, and unlucky in love. His viral success has pigeon-holed him as the how-to guy for a buzzy, internet media company instead of covering hard-hitting politics. Fed up with his fluffy articles and the app-based dating scene as well, he strikes a deal with his boss to write a final piece de resistance: How to Lose a Girl. Easier said than done when the girl he meets is Hannah Mayfield, and he's not sure he wants her to dump him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah is an extremely successful event planner who's focused on climbing the career ladder. Her firm is one of the most prestigious in the city, and she's determined to secure her next promotion. But Hannah has a bit of an image problem. She needs to show her boss that she has range, including planning dreaded, romantic weddings. Enter Jack. He’s the perfect man to date for a couple weeks to prove to her boss that she’s not scared of feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Jack and Hannah know it, their fake relationship starts to feel all too real—and neither of them can stand to lose each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the latest novel from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Hope Burns&lt;/i&gt;, a woman discovers that the man she least expects is exactly what she needs…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High school math teacher Chelsea Gardner has the perfect plan. She’s tired of dating all the wrong men, and after years of frustration, she’s developed a foolproof list of requirements for finding “The One.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar owner Sebastian “Bash” Palmer finds Chelsea beautiful, smart and fun, but he thinks her list is ridiculous and unnecessary. Intent on proving Chelsea is looking for love in all the wrong ways, he offers to help her find the “perfect” man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chelsea knows Bash isn’t the right guy for her—he barely meets one of her criteria—but there’s something about the charismatic man that has her yearning for things that are most definitely not list approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because sometimes, a relationship that looks totally wrong on paper can turn out incredibly right…</description>

      <![CDATA[Rating: 3.5 Stars<br /><br />This book was very satisfying, as I expected from Burton. I was happy to be back in Hope and really excited that this pairing was a second-chance romance. They two were high school sweethearts, who had a major falling out that sent Molly running. She lived a nomadic l...]]>

  <description>Zora Novak has been framed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone burns down the home of the school janitor and he dies in the blaze, everyone in Addamsville, Indiana, points a finger at Zora. Never mind that Zora has been on the straight and narrow since her father was thrown in jail. With everyone looking for evidence against her, her only choice is to uncover the identity of the real killer. There’s one big problem—Zora has no leads. No one does. Addamsville has a history of tragedy, and thirty years ago a similar string of fires left several townspeople dead. The arsonist was never caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Zora must team up with her cousin Artemis—an annoying self-proclaimed Addamsville historian—to clear her name. But with a popular ghost-hunting television show riling up the townspeople, almost no support from her family and friends, and rumors spinning out of control, things aren’t looking good. Zora will have to read between the lines of Addamsville’s ghost stories before she becomes one herself.</description>

  <description>The only thing connecting Sloane to her older sister Talley is a list–random places, unfamiliar names, a phone number that she doesn’t recognize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Talley died, Sloane has been completely fixated on it: maybe understanding how the items on list connect is the key to understanding why Talley took her own life. Except the clues on the list seem to be pointing her to California, and Talley had never even been there, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the list of things Sloane didn’t know about her sister is much longer than she realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She heads out west in search of Adam, the owner of the mysterious phone number, who claims he’d never met Talley. Even though Adam is clearly hiding something, Sloane can’t deny that she’s drawn to him. Can unraveling the cryptic non-sequiturs Talley left behind – and putting her trust in a stranger – heal the hole her sister’s death has left in Sloane’s life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From author Courtney Sheinmel comes an engaging and heartfelt novel about the bonds of sisterhood, the imprecision of memory, and the incomparable value of finding something to live for.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this poignant, funny, and romantic novel, four nights of epic partying will see two teens through their highest highs and lowest lows over the course of one unforgettable year. Perfect for fans of Gayle Forman and Mary H.K. Choi!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tucker&lt;/strong&gt; knows that some relationships take work. With his best friend, Bobby, and his mom, everything is simple, steady. His dad, on the other hand, seems to only show up when he wants to bring Tucker down. Then there’s Erika Green, who comes back into his life, stirring up old feelings. A small part of him knows he shouldn’t get too attached during senior year. But a bigger part doesn’t want her to disappear again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt; from before the video loved to shock people. Now, she just wants to hole up in her quiet college life and leave the past where it belongs—in a dumpster fire. But then she reconnects with Tucker Campanelli. Erika can’t explain what it is about him. There’s just this undeniable connection between them, and she really doesn’t want to lose that feeling. Not yet.</description>

  <description>Life is a mixed bag for Piper Calloway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, she’s a twenty-nine-year-old VP at her dad’s multibillion-dollar real estate development firm, and living the high single life with her two best friends in a swanky downtown penthouse. On the other hand, she’s considered a pair of sexy legs in a male-dominated world and constantly has to prove her worth. Plus, she’s stuck seeing her narcissistic ex-fiancé—a fellow VP—on the other side of her glass office wall every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things get exponentially more complicated for Piper when she runs into Kyle Miller—the handsome new security guard at Calloway Group Industries, and coincidentally the first love of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy she hasn’t seen or heard from since they were summer camp counsellors together. The guy from the wrong side of the tracks. The guy who &lt;i&gt;apparently&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t even remember her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper may be a high-powered businesswoman now, but she soon realizes that her schoolgirl crush is not only alive but stronger than ever, and crippling her concentration. What’s more, despite Kyle’s distant attitude, she’s convinced their reunion isn’t at all coincidental, and that his feelings for her still run deep. And she’s determined to make him admit to them, no matter the consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Debut author Sarah Smith nails this fun and sexy multicultural romance where two office foes hammer out their differences to build a love that will last...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmie Echavarre is a professional faker. She has to be to survive as one of the few female employees at Nuts &amp;amp; Bolts, a power tool company staffed predominantly by gruff, burly men. From nine to five, Monday through Friday, she's tough as nails--the complete opposite of her easy-going real self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing she doesn't have to fake? Her disdain for coworker Tate Rasmussen. Tate has been hostile to her since the day they met. Emmie's friendly greetings and repeated attempts to get to know him failed to garner anything more than scowls and terse one-word answers. Too bad she can't stop staring at his Thor-like biceps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emmie and Tate are forced to work together on a charity construction project, things get...heated. Emmie's beginning to see that beneath Tate's chiseled exterior lies a soft heart, but it will take more than a few kind words to erase the past and convince her that what they have is real.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the Wynns—a hockey dynasty built on family, money, and drama. From &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Kelly Jamieson, the first novel in a new series is a total win-win.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After an injury forced &lt;b&gt;Théo Wynn&lt;/b&gt; to give up professional hockey, he turned to his second love: numbers. Now, as the general manager of his grandfather’s NHL team, the Los Angeles Condors, Théo is dying to prove to the rest of his family—especially the brother who betrayed him—that he’s just as successful as the rest of them. If only Théo had a gorgeous woman on his arm to complete the picture. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lacey Olson&lt;/b&gt; needs to get out of Las Vegas right now, thanks to her no-good, crooked brother. When a handsome stranger who’s out partying with friends comes to her rescue in the cocktail lounge where she works, they strike up a conversation that leads to a crazy plan: her leaving with Théo for L.A. tomorrow. A few drinks later, the idea gets even crazier: a quickie marriage that works for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But back in California, Lacey immediately turns Théo’s precise, well-ordered life into one big beach party. And before long, she’s tempting him with her smart mouth, sexy body, and sunny charm. The last thing Théo needs is a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; relationship to distract him. Because he only plays to win. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Kelly Jamieson’s &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Aces Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MAJOR MISCONDUCT&lt;br /&gt; OFF LIMITS&lt;br /&gt; ICING&lt;br /&gt; TOP SHELF&lt;br /&gt; BACK CHECK&lt;br /&gt; SLAP SHOT&lt;br /&gt; PLAYING HURT&lt;br /&gt; BIG STICK&lt;br /&gt; GAME ON&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s alluring reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT | LONG SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three's a crowd, but four's a war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big girl undies? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Speech planned? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Nerves of steel? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A single crush? …not check…?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when you find your best friend/crush kissing your other best friend on the day you were going to declare your feelings for him? You only agree to fake date your crush’s rival. The King of the Bows, popular golden (play)boy, and all around douche, Xander wouldn’t be my last choice for a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the school, battlelines are drawn and sides are taken between the new ’it’ couple of my former best friends and the excitingly scandalous pairing of me and King Douche. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xander keeps distracting me from the plan; make Jason jealous. He insists on holding my hand and kissing me and being nice. Ugh. Xander’s not nice and he’s not the relationship type, but he’s doing a damned good job of acting both parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls it ‘keeping up appearances’, I call it ‘take one more pass at my arse and I’ll break your nose’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say all’s fair in love and war, but what’s so fair about falling for the wrong guy when your two best friends are on the other side of the battlelines?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be aware that this story is set in Australia and therefore uses Australian English spelling and syntax.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34805036-book-boyfriend" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He's too hot for words. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Lawson might as well be the hottest book boyfriend imaginable. A fun, romantic, possessive, panty-melting man. And the best part? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a girl like me—a slightly awkward book addict—Alex is a dream come true, straight off the pages of my favorite romance novels. But our story is turning into a whirlwind romance—the kind that only exists in books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I wonder if we’re heading toward our own happily ever after, or if he’s too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the thing. I’m not a bad guy. Lying to Mia wasn’t part of the plan. Finding success as a romance author using a female pen name wasn’t part of the plan either. But sometimes life takes unexpected turns. Like realizing the woman you’re falling for is your alter-ego’s online best friend. &lt;br /&gt;Online, she thinks I’m a woman named Lexi. In person, she knows I’m all man. I want to worship her body and claim every inch of her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if she finds out the truth, I could lose everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Planner &lt;/i&gt;in this prequel to &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne’s The Wedding Belles series about three high-powered New York City women who can plan any wedding—but their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up-and-coming wedding photographer Leah McHale’s career is on the rise–thanks in no small part to the Wedding Belles, the elite New York wedding planning agency that always throws top-tier business Leah’s way. So when one of the Belles asks Leah to fill in at the former First Daughter's wedding, Leah is overjoyed to say yes–until she finds out who she’ll be working with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Rhodes is the one man who was able to capture Leah’s heart and, once he had it, promptly stepped all over it and left her broken. Now he’s working side-by-side with her at the biggest wedding of the season and Leah is determined to give him the cold shoulder. Despite his persistence, she is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to fall for his charming, impish ways again. Not even if he still has that killer, irresistible smile...</description>

  <description>Best friends Marine Duval and Kate Sanders have trained at the Paris Opera Ballet School since childhood, where they’ve formed an inseparable bond forged by respective family tragedies and a fierce love for dance. When the body of a student is found in the dorms just before the start of their final year, Marine and Kate begin to ask themselves what they would do to win the ultimate prize: to be the one girl selected to join the Opera’s prestigious corps de ballet. Would they die? Cheat? Seduce the most talented boy in the school, dubbed the Demigod, hoping his magic would make them shine, too? Neither girl is sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Kate gets closer to the Demigod, even as Marine has begun to capture his heart. And as selection day draws near, the competition—for the prize, for the Demigod—becomes fiercer, and Marine and Kate realize they have everything to lose, including each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Come Back to Me&lt;/i&gt; comes a striking new novel about a young woman— desperately trying to protect her family from their violent father—who finds safety, and a passionate romance, with an ex-Marine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Zoey was a kid she’s been caring for her mom and her little sister, defending them from her violent father. She’s been the strong one, the responsible one as she sacrificed her wants and dreams to keep her family together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the life they’ve built for themselves in California is about to be upended. Her father, just released from prison, has discovered where they’re hiding and has come looking for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Tristan. A former Marine and now member of the Coast Guard, Tristian promises his best friend, and Zoey’s Marine brother, that he will take care of Zoey and her family. Protect them, watch over them, and be the rock they need in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as Tristan starts to help Zoey deal with the emotional fall out of her childhood, their relationship turns from protector to something more. The two grow closer as a romance blooms into a heart-pounding and powerful relationship that Zoey hopes will be strong enough to fight off the damage her father has done to her and her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone can be kept safe forever, and when Zoey’s father does show up, a confrontation ensues that will change Zoey’s world forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

Now that her business is thriving, it’s time to turn towards her much neglected personal life, and Alexis approaches her relationships like she does everything else: with a plan. &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; a part of that plan is Logan Harris, the silent partner in the Belles, and the one person who’s been there for her since the very beginning. But Alexis needs someone fun, and Logan’s all business, all the time—except when a late night at the office ends with an unexpected kiss that leaves the usually cool and together Alexis reeling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Logan has lusted after Alexis since the day he walked into the tiny Harlem apartment that used to double as her office. But the ambitious wedding planner has always been untouchable...until now. Alexis has made it clear that she’s on the dating market—and equally clear that he’s not in the running. But when Alexis finds herself in need of a date for her sister’s last minute wedding in Florida, Logan knows it’s the perfect time to show Alexis that there’s more to him than numbers and spreadsheets—and beneath the pinstripes and glasses lies a hot-blooded heartthrob. As Florida’s sultry days turn into even hotter nights, Logan’s out to convince Alexis that the fling of a lifetime could just maybe turn into forever...</description>

      <![CDATA[As always, I enjoyed this book. It was fun with a touch of drama and just the right amount of emotional bits. I really empathized with Alexis. What happened to her was quite a blow, and because of the circumstances, she really never got to leave it behind, but I wanted to give her a good shake. S...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a witty romance about first love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned by her dream job in New York City, sports journalist Neely Kimber suddenly finds herself jobless and paying a long-overdue visit to her hometown in Tennessee. Her plan? Relax, reset, and head back up the corporate ladder. There’s just one unexpected step. Neely’s back in Dogwood Lane for barely a day when she sees the man she ran from nine years ago: the bad boy next door who was her first kiss, her first love, and her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted single dad Dane Madden knows he hurt Neely in the worst way. He’s got a lot to make up for. And as passionate as their reconnection is, it’s a lot to hope for. Having her back in his arms feels so right. But falling in love all over again with a woman who wants to live a world away is bound to go so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s it going to take for Neely to give him—and Dogwood Lane—just one more chance?</description>

One reason was that it was a second chance romance (my favorite!). Dane and Neely had been high school sweethearts, but broke up before Neely left for college. I was pretty surpr...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I was standing on one leg shucking oysters when the problems began…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don and Rosie are back in Melbourne after a decade in New York, and they’re about to face their most important project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their son, Hudson, is having trouble at school: his teachers say he isn’t fitting in with the other kids. Meanwhile, Rosie is battling Judas at work, and Don is in hot water after the Genetics Lecture Outrage. The life-contentment graph, recently at its highest point, is curving downwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Don Tillman, geneticist and World’s Best Problem-Solver, learning to be a good parent as well as a good partner will require the help of friends old and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will mean letting Hudson make his way in the world, and grappling with awkward truths about his own identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And opening a cocktail bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious and thought-provoking, with a brilliant cast of characters and an ending that will have readers cheering for joy, &lt;i&gt;The Rosie Result &lt;/i&gt;is the triumphant final instalment of the internationally bestselling series that began with &lt;i&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the two years since her father died, sixteen-year-old Eva has found comfort in reading romance novels—118 of them, to be exact—to dull the pain of her loss that’s still so present. Her romantic fantasies become a reality when she meets Will, who seems to truly understand Eva’s grief. Unfortunately, after Eva falls head-over-heels for him, he picks up and moves to California without any warning. Not wanting to lose the only person who has been able to pull her out of sadness—and, perhaps, her shot at real love—Eva and her best friend, Annie, concoct a plan to travel to the west coast to see Will again. As they road trip across America, Eva and Annie confront the complex truth about love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this honest and emotional journey that National Book Award finalist Sara Zarr calls “gorgeous, funny, and joyous,” readers will experience the highs of infatuation and the lows of heartache as Eva contends with love in all of its forms.</description>

  <description>Will a budding wedding planner and her bad boy neighbor stop banging heads and start hearing wedding bells in the sexy second novel in &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Lauren Layne’s irresistible new series that marries &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/i&gt;with &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Planner&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When small-town girl Heather Fowler finally gets promoted from assistant to &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; wedding planner, she’s determined to make it as one of Manhattan’s elite Wedding Belles. Unfortunately, her first client demands an opulent black-tie affair at the Plaza…in five months’ time. Heather’s days quickly become a flurry of cake tastings, dress-fittings, RSVP cards, and bridal tantrums. But what she’s really losing sleep over is the live music blaring from her playboy neighbor’s apartment all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, Josh Tanner was an up-and-comer on Wall Street, complete with the penthouse and the migraines. But a grim cancer diagnosis made him realize there is more to life than the corner office. If only he could convince his pretty, workaholic neighbor to let loose, too. As Heather lets down her guard, Josh is surprised when he starts falling for the sweet, vulnerable woman hiding beneath those power suits. Soon, it’s Heather’s turn to convince Josh to take the biggest risk of all: love.</description>

  <description>Dash Hennessy is the hottest bachelor in the country, looking for love in front of an audience of millions… He just wasn’t supposed to pick ME! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just landed my dream summer gig: working as a production assistant on TV’s smash-hit reality show, Ever After. Two months of sun and fun at the beach? Sign me up! Until the moment I come face to face with this season’s bachelor, racing’s bad boy Dash - aka, the mysterious hottie I just hooked up with at a creepy motel off the I-80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you say, awkward?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dash is sexy, charming - and totally off-limits. But the chemistry between us is way too hot to ignore. He’s playing to win, and he’s got his sights set on the prize: me! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, the action is heating up off-screen. But between ratings-hungry producers, back-stage drama, and twelve of the most cutthroat glamazon contestants known to womankind, I’m in way over my head. Can I find my happily-ever-after, or will it be lights, camera, heartbreak? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bachelor gets a rom-com twist in Katie McCoy’s hilarious, sexy new read!</description>

  <description>Susan is the new girl—she’s sharp and driven, and strives to meet her parents’ expectations of excellence. Malcolm is the bad boy—he started raising hell at age fifteen, after his mom died of cancer, and has had a reputation ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan’s parents are on the verge of divorce. Malcolm’s dad is a known adulterer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan hasn’t told anyone, but she wants to be an artist. Malcolm doesn’t know what he wants—until he meets her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is messy and families are messier, but in spite of their burdens, Susan and Malcolm fall for each other. The ways they drift apart and come back together are testaments to family, culture, and being true to who you are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is the Dragons’ new wide receiver: A) a fallen NFL star looking for a comeback, B) the sexy player your boss wants you to write an exposé on, or C) the former love of your life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Milwaukee Dragons beat reporter Natalie Griffith, he’s clearly &lt;i&gt;D) all of the above&lt;/i&gt;. Three years ago, Natalie’s bombshell report on her ex-boyfriend’s off-the-field scandals landed her the job she loves, but she still feels guilty about destroying his career. Now Quinn Lowry’s back, and he’s taking over &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; locker room, flashing his charming smile and reminding her exactly how hot they were together.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After two years out of the league, Quinn is sober and on the field again. He’s worked his ass off and he’s not going to blow his second chance, not even for the woman who broke his heart—twice. Having Natalie around is the last thing Quinn needs while he’s trying to prove he deserves to stay on the team.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe one final night together will give them both some much-needed closure. But with Natalie’s boss pressuring her for another headline-grabbing scoop, can she admit to herself that she’s falling for Quinn all over again?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At the news of her mother's death, Natalie Tan returns home. The two women hadn't spoken since Natalie left in anger seven years ago, when her mother refused to support her chosen career as a chef. Natalie is shocked to discover the vibrant neighborhood of San Francisco's Chinatown that she remembers from her childhood is fading, with businesses failing and families moving out. She's even more surprised to learn she has inherited her grandmother's restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neighborhood seer reads the restaurant's fortune in the leaves: Natalie must cook three recipes from her grandmother's cookbook to aid her struggling neighbors before the restaurant will succeed. Unfortunately, Natalie has no desire to help them try to turn things around--she resents the local shopkeepers for leaving her alone to take care of her agoraphobic mother when she was growing up. But with the support of a surprising new friend and a budding romance, Natalie starts to realize that maybe her neighbors really have been there for her all along.</description>

  <description>"I need Owen to explain this. Because yes, I do know that Owen would never do that, but I also know Hannah would never lie about something like that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara and Owen are about as close as twins can get. So when Mara's friend Hannah accuses Owen of rape, Mara doesn't know what to think. Can the brother she loves really be guilty of such a violent crime? Torn between the family she loves and her own sense of right and wrong, Mara is feeling lost, and it doesn't help that things have been strained with her ex-girlfriend and best friend since childhood, Charlie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mara, Hannah, and Charlie navigate this new terrain, Mara must face a trauma from her own past and decide where Charlie fits in her future. With sensitivity and openness, this timely novel confronts the difficult questions surrounding consent, victim blaming, and sexual assault.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Gold Valley, Oregon, where a rough-and-tumble rancher and the girl next door are about to learn that opposites attract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia Logan has a plan: win back her ex by making him see what he’s missing. But first she needs to find a man who’s willing to play along. With his laid-back cowboy charm and knack for getting under her skin, Luke Hollister is an unlikely hero—but he wants her help convincing her father to sell him land, which means he needs her as much as she needs him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke likes his life—and his women—uncomplicated. So why does good girl Olivia heat his blood like no one else? She’s always been off-limits, but the more time they spend as Gold Valley’s hottest new “couple,” the more real it’s starting to feel. Luke was supposed to help her win back another man…not keep her in his arms. But now that he has her there, he’s not sure he’ll ever let go.</description>

  <description>All's &lt;i&gt;faire&lt;/i&gt; in love and war for two sworn enemies who indulge in a harmless flirtation in a laugh-out-loud rom-com from debut author, Jen DeLuca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily knew there would be strings attached when she relocated to the small town of Willow Creek, Maryland, for the summer to help her sister recover from an accident, but who could anticipate getting roped into volunteering for the local Renaissance Faire alongside her teenaged niece? Or that the irritating and inscrutable schoolteacher in charge of the volunteers would be so annoying that she finds it impossible to stop thinking about him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faire is Simon's family legacy and from the start he makes clear he doesn't have time for Emily's lighthearted approach to life, her oddball Shakespeare conspiracy theories, or her endless suggestions for new acts to shake things up. Yet on the faire grounds he becomes a different person, flirting freely with Emily when she's in her revealing wench's costume. But is this attraction real, or just part of the characters they're portraying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer was only ever supposed to be a pit stop on the way to somewhere else for Emily, but soon she can't seem to shake the fantasy of establishing something more with Simon, or a permanent home of her own in Willow Creek.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Susan Mallery welcomes you to Happily Inc, where true love isn’t just for fairy tales…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Kaleta will do anything for the artists at her gallery, including risk life, limb and the effect of humidity on her naturally curly hair. Braving a downpour to check on reclusive Ronan Mitchell, Natalie gets stranded by a mudslide at his mountain home, where the brooding glass artist reveals his playful side, sending her inconvenient crush from under-the-radar to over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a secret tore apart his family and made him question his sense of self, Ronan fled his hometown for Happily Inc, but the sunny small town can’t fix his damaged heart. He won’t give in to his attraction for beautiful, perpetually cheerful Natalie. She’s untouched by darkness—or so he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie knows that when a heart goes through the flame, it comes out stronger. Life may not be a fairy tale, but sometimes dreams do come true. Why not this one? Why not tonight?</description>

  <description>What did you hear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly Landis-Lilley and Teddy Lin are over. Yes, &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Kim and Teddy broke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that's what Phil Spooner thinks he overheard and then told Jess Howard, Kim's best friend. Something about Teddy not liking Kim's Instas? Or was it that Teddy is moving to Italy and didn't want to do long distance? Or that Kim slid into someone else's DMs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess told her boyfriend, Elvis, that he needs to be on Kim's side. Especially if he wants to keep her as his girlfriend. But Elvis is also Teddy's best friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Kim's run out of school for the day. Jess is furious. Elvis is confused. And half the lunch period won't talk to Teddy. Even the teachers have taken sides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Henry Harrison High will never be the same again!</description>

      <![CDATA[Rating: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />This is the hilarious, absurd, and over the top fun that made me a Strohm fan. This book is very reminiscent of It's Not Me, It's You and The Date to Save, and it delivered the laughter I was hoping to find. It gets a little emotional and the warm fuzzies found me in...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes, you say everything when you say nothing at all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I should have the perfect life, that I should never feel down or alone in the world. But, so sue me, I do. I keep it hidden, pretend everything’s okay. Because who would believe Piper Barlow could have issues?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s convinced the hottest guy in school’s going to ask me out - that Mason and I would be the perfect couple, that he’s my John Cusack. Except, he hasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One holidays, I find myself hanging out with the resident underachiever, and he surprises me. With Roman, I don’t have to pretend that little Piper Barlow is perfect; even if we’re both in a foul mood, just sitting in silence together is perfectly enough. Until it becomes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, Roman doesn’t do more. Does he...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when you accidentally find perfection with the wrong guy?&lt;br /&gt;You fight for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally Perfect &lt;i&gt;is a Mature YA novel about finding support in the least likely of places, never giving up, and learning that being the real you is always perfect. Please be aware that this story is set in Australia and therefore uses Australian English spelling and syntax. Not recommended for younger readers due to mature content.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne is the “queen of witty dialogue and sexy scenes” (Rachel Van Dyken)! Now, &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Planner&lt;/i&gt; in The Wedding Belles, her sizzling brand new contemporary romance series about three ambitious wedding planners who can make any bride’s dream come true... but their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovering her fiance is an international con man just moments before they exchange vows devastates celebrity wedding planner Brooke Baldwin's business—and breaks her heart. Now a pariah in Los Angeles, she seeks a fresh start in New York City and thinks she’s found it with her first bridal client, a sweet—if slightly spoiled—hotel heiress. Then she meets the uptight businessman who’s holding the purse strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth Tyler wishes he could write a blank check and be done with his sister Maya's fancy-pants wedding. Unfortunately, micromanaging the event is his only chance at proving Maya’s fiance is a liar. Standing directly in his way is the stunning blonde wedding planner whose practiced smiles and sassy comebacks both irritate and arouse him. He needs Brooke’s help. But can he persuade a wedding planner on a comeback mission to &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;plan a wedding? And more importantly, how will he convince her that the wedding she should be planning... is theirs?</description>

  <description>Before she had an eating disorder, twelve-year-old Riley was many things: an aspiring artist, a runner, a sister, and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, from inside the inpatient treatment center where she's receiving treatment for anorexia, it's easy to forget all of that. Especially since under the influence of her eating disorder, Riley alienated her friends, abandoned her art, turned running into something harmful, and destroyed her family's trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Riley wants her life back, she has to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of her wants to get better. As she goes to therapy, makes friends in the hospital, and starts to draw again, things begin to look up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her roommate starts to break the rules, triggering Riley's old behaviors and blackmailing her into silence, Riley realizes that recovery will be even harder than she thought. She starts to think that even if she does "recover," there's no way she'll stay recovered once she leaves the hospital and is faced with her dieting mom, the school bully, and her gymnastics-star sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by an eating disorder survivor, this is a realistic depiction of inpatient eating disorder treatment, and a moving story about a girl who has to fight herself to survive.</description>

  <description>A chance encounter in the dark leads eighteen-year-old Daniel and the girl who stumbles across him to profess their love for each other. But this love has conditions: they agree it will last only one hour, and it will be only make-believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their hour is up and the girl rushes off like Cinderella, Daniel tries to convince himself that what happened between them seemed perfect only because they were pretending it was. Moments like that happen only in fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year and one bad relationship later, his disbelief in love-at-first-sight is stripped away the day he meets Six: a girl with a strange name and an even stranger personality. Unfortunately for Daniel, finding true love doesn"t guarantee a happily ever after... it only further threatens it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will an unbearable secret from the past jeopardize Daniel and Six's only chance at saving each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Lauren Oliver and E. Lockhart, here is a dreamy love story set in the dark halls of contemporary high school, from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Brenna Yovanoff.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waverly Camdenmar spends her nights running until she can’t even think. Then the sun comes up, life goes on, and Waverly goes back to her perfectly hateful best friend, her perfectly dull classes, and the tiny, nagging suspicion that there’s more to life than student council and GPAs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marshall Holt is a loser. He drinks on school nights and gets stoned in the park. He is at risk of not graduating, he does not care, he is no one. He is not even close to being in Waverly’s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one night Waverly falls asleep and dreams herself into Marshall’s bedroom—and when the sun comes up, nothing in her life can ever be the same. In Waverly’s dreams, the rules have changed. But in her days, she’ll have to decide if it’s worth losing everything for a boy who barely exists.</description>

  <description>A year ago, Penny Berne was the star of her high school’s theater department, surrounded by a group of misfit friends and falling in love for the first time. Now her old friends won’t talk to her, her new best friend is the most popular girl in school, and her first love, Wes, ignores her. Penny is revered and hated. Then, in a flash, a near-fatal lightning strike leaves Penny with no memory of the past year—or how she went from drama nerd to queen bee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a record number of fireflies light up her town and her life, Penny realizes she may be able to make things right again—and that even if she can’t change the past, she can learn to see the magic where she never could before.</description>

  <description>Fight for your dreams, even if it means breaking a few rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ryan Russell has life perfectly planned. If she keeps up her hard work, one day she’ll take over the family business: owning the Buckley Beavers, a minor league baseball team, and become one of the only female General Managers in the sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the newest member of the Beavers, child-phenom Sawyer Campbell, shows up, Ryan’s carefully laid plans are thrown a major curveball. Sawyer is far more charming than the arrogant jocks she usually manages, his ambition rivals her own workaholic nature—and he’s completely out of bounds. Fraternizing is against every rule in the Beaver’s handbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Ryan’s divorced parents butt heads over the future of the Beavers, and her mom plans to sell her shares to a business group known for relocating teams. If this happens, Ryan’s dreams of becoming GM disappear. In a bid to save her future, she partners with Sawyer to use his star power to draw in sponsors who will keep the team in Buckley. But the more time she spends with him, the more impossible it becomes to play by the Beaver’s rules, and she can’t afford a strikeout on the path to her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full count with two outs, Ryan’s one pitch away from losing the whole ball game.</description>

  <description>"Sizzling, sexy and so much fun!"--&lt;strong&gt;SARAH MORGAN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt; USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author for &lt;em&gt;Bad Bachelor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Maxwell had her whole life figured out...until her fianc� left her when his career took off. If that wasn't bad enough, every society blog posted pictures of him escorting a woman wearing her wedding ring. To help the women of New York avoid men like her ex, she created the Bad Bachelors app. But try as she might, Annie just can't forget him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside his stellar career, CEO Joe Preston has made a lot of mistakes. None was worse than leaving the love of his life when she needed him most. Now, he's ready for a second chance. He may still be one heck of a bad influence, but when Annie's safety is threatened by a hacker, Joe is the only one who can save her--and he'll do whatever it takes to win her back. But will their hard-won bond survive the revelation that Annie is the one pulling the strings behind Bad Bachelors?</description>

  <description>Ever since her mother walked out, Trix McCabe has been determined to make it on her own. And with her near-magical gift for pulling valuables off unsuspecting strangers, Trix is confident she has what it takes to survive. Until she’s caught and given a choice: jail time, or go live with her long-lost family in the tiny town of Rocksaw, Kansas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trix doesn’t plan to stick around Rocksaw long, but there’s something special about her McCabe relatives that she is drawn to. Her aunt, Mia, bakes pies that seem to cure all ills. Her cousin, Ember, can tell a person’s deepest secret with the touch of a hand. And Trix’s great-aunt takes one look at Trix’s palm and tells her that if she doesn’t put down roots somewhere, she won’t have a future anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Trix feels like she might finally belong with this special group of women in this tiny town in Kansas. But when her past comes back to haunt her, she’ll have to decide whether to take a chance on this new life . . . or keep running from the one she’s always known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lovable and flawed characters, an evocative setting, and friendships to treasure, &lt;i&gt;A Constellation of Roses&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect companion to Miranda Asebedo’s debut novel &lt;i&gt;The Deepest Roots.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Sarah wakes up  dead at the Mall of America, she learns that not only was she murdered,  her killer is still on the loose. &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When you’re sixteen, you have your whole life ahead of you. Unless you’re Sarah. Not to give anything away, but . . . she’s dead. Murdered, in fact. Sarah’s murder is shocking because she couldn’t  &lt;u&gt;be&lt;/u&gt;  any more average. No enemies. No risky behavior. She’s just the girl on the sidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like her afterlife, on the other hand, will be pretty exciting. Sarah has woken up dead at the Mall of America—where the universe sends teens who are murdered—and with the help of her death coach, she must learn to move on or she could meet a fate totally worse than death: becoming a mall walker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she tries to finish her unfinished business alongside her fellow dead teens, Sarah falls hard for a cute boy named Nick. And she discovers an uncanny ability to haunt the living. While she has no idea who killed her, or why, someone she loves is in grave danger. Sarah can’t lose focus or she’ll be doomed to relive her final moments again and again forever. But can she live with herself if she doesn’t make her death matter?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you’re planning on falling in love…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the confident, charismatic Caleb Parker, Sadie Lane feels the spark—the kind that comes from rubbing each other the wrong way. She’s a tattoo artist, he’s a straight-laced mogul. But after they accidentally co-rescue an abandoned dog from a storm, Sadie sees a vulnerable side to the seemingly invincible hottie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;you’d better be sure…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb doesn’t do emotions. Growing up the underdog, he’s learned the hard way to build up an impenetrable wall. Perfect for business. Disastrous for relationships. He’s never worried about it before—not until he finally gets behind Sadie’s armor and begins to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;… someone is there to catch you.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both guarded and vulnerable, Sadie and Caleb are complete opposites. Or are they? Shocked at their undeniable connection, can they ever admit to wanting more? That all depends on what they’re each willing to risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lauren Layne’s bestselling Oxford Series continues with the poignant, heartwarming story of New York’s most eligible bachelor, Lincoln Mathis, a man who’s living a lie—until his dream woman takes away the pain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Mathis doesn’t hide his reputation as Manhattan’s ultimate playboy. In fact, he cultivates it. But behind every flirtatious smile, each provocative quip, there’s a secret that Lincoln’s hiding from even his closest friends—a tragedy from his past that holds his heart quietly captive. Lincoln knows what he wants: someone like Daisy Sinclair, the sassy, off-limits bridesmaid he can’t take his eyes off at his best friend’s wedding. He also knows that she’s everything he can never have.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a devastating divorce, Daisy doesn’t need anyone to warn her off the charming best man at her sister’s wedding. One look at the breathtakingly hot Lincoln Mathis and she knows that he’s exactly the type of man she should avoid. But when Daisy stumbles upon Lincoln’s secret, she realizes there’s more to the charming playboy than meets the eye. And suddenly Daisy and Lincoln find their lives helplessly entwined in a journey that will either heal their damaged souls . . . or destroy them forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Big mouth. Big heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big wedding. Big problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's the wedding of the century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things are looking up at last for Lizzie Nichols. She has a career she loves in the field of her choice (wedding gown restoration), and the love of her life, Jean-Luc, has finally proposed. Life's become a dizzying whirl of wedding gown fittings—not necessarily her own—as Lizzie prepares for her dream wedding at her fiancé's château in the south of France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the dream soon becomes a nightmare as the best man—whom Lizzie might once have accidentally slept with . . . no, really, just slept—announces his total lack of support for the couple, a sentiment the maid of honor happens to second; Lizzie's Midwestern family can't understand why she doesn't want to have her wedding in the family backyard; her future, oh-so-proper French in-laws seem to be slowly trying to lure the groom away from medical school and back into investment banking; and Lizzie finds herself wondering if her Prince Charming really is as charming as she once believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Lizzie really ready to embrace her new role as wife and mistress of Château Mirac? Or is she destined to fall into another man's arms . . . and into the trap of becoming a Bad Girl instead?</description>

      <![CDATA[Cabot surprised me a bit with this series, but I really enjoyed watching Lizzie grow and change. I was happy she finally opened her eyes and was able to see people without her rose colored filter, and I loved knowing that Lizzie was heading for a great future. <br /><br /><a href="http://weliveandbreathebooks.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow"> BLOG</a> |<a href="https://www.instagram.co...</a>]]>

  <description>Lizzie Nichols is back, pounding the New York City pavement and looking for a job, a place to live, and her proper place in the universe (not necessarily in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When "Summer Fling" Luke uses the L word (Living Together), Lizzie is only too happy to give up her plan of being postgrad roomies with best friend, Shari, in a one-room walk-up in exchange for cohabitation with the love of her life in his mother's Fifth Avenue pied-à-terre, complete with doorman and resident Renoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lizzie's not as lucky in her employment search. As Shari finds the perfect job, Lizzie struggles through one humiliating interview after another, being judged overqualified for the jobs in her chosen field—vintage-gown rehab—and underqualified for everything else. It's Shari's boyfriend Chaz to the rescue when he recommends Lizzie for a receptionist's position at his father's posh law firm. The nonpaying gig at a local wedding-gown shop Lizzie manages to land all on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lizzie's notoriously big mouth begins to get her into trouble at work and at home almost at once—first at the law firm, where she becomes too chummy with Jill Higgins, a New York society bride with a troublesome future mother-in-law, and then back on Fifth Avenue, when she makes the mistake of bringing up the M word (Marriage) with commitment-shy Luke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Lizzie finds herself jobless as well as homeless all over again. Can Lizzie save herself—and the hapless Jill—and find career security (not to mention a mutually satisfying committed relationship) at last?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEVER SAY NEVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie Gold is ready to take her career to the next level with the role of a lifetime. Finally, she can shake her reputation as a pretty face with more wealth and connections than talent. But Sadie is not prepared for the wild turn her own life is about to take. The man in charge of training Sadie for her most demanding role yet is none other than her first real boyfriend—the one who took her heart and ran away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bo Ibarra is as good-looking and irresistible as ever. Maybe even more so, now that everything once worked against them—Sadie’s pampered and privileged upbringing and Bo’s childhood in a family struggling to make ends meet—is in the past. But the future is still unwritten…and getting there, together, means coming clean about painful secrets and slashing through nasty tabloid rumors while trying to control the attraction that crackles between them. Maybe it’s finally time for them to walk off into the sunset and into a true and lasting love?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Swipe right for love. Swipe left for disaster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day, Mel Strickland is an underemployed helpdesk tech at a startup incubator, Hatch, where she helps entitled brogrammers—"Hatchlings"—who can't even fix their own laptops, but are apparently the next wave of startup geniuses. And by night, she goes on bad dates with misbehaving dudes she's matched with on the ubiquitous dating app, Fluttr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one dick pic too many, Mel has had it. Using her brilliant coding skills, she designs an app of her own, one that allows users to log harrassers and abusers in online dating space. It's called JerkAlert, and it goes viral overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mel is suddenly in way over her head. Worse still, her almost-boyfriend, the dreamy Alex Hernandez—the only non-douchey guy at Hatch—has no idea she's the brains behind the app. Soon, Mel is faced with a terrible choice: one that could destroy her career, love life, and friendships, or change her life forever.</description>

  <description>Regina Hobbs is nerdy by nature, businesswoman by nurture. She's finally taking her pop culture-centered media enterprise, Girls with Glasses, to the next level, but the stress is forcing her to face a familiar supervillain: insomnia. The only thing that helps her sleep when things get this bad is the deep, soothing voice of puzzle-obsessed live streamer Gustave Nguyen. The problem? His archive has been deleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gus has been tasked with creating an escape room themed around a romance anime…except he knows nothing about romance or anime. Then mega-nerd and anime expert Reggie comes calling, and they make a trade: his voice for her knowledge. But when their online friendship has IRL chemistry, will they be able to escape love?</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old twins Adina and Tovah have little in common besides their ambitious nature. Viola prodigy Adina yearns to become a soloist—and to convince her music teacher he wants her the way she wants him. Overachiever Tovah awaits her acceptance to Johns Hopkins, the first step on her path toward med school and a career as a surgeon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing could wreck their carefully planned futures: a genetic test for Huntington’s, a rare degenerative disease that slowly steals control of the body and mind. It’s turned their Israeli mother into a near stranger and fractured the sisters’ own bond in ways they’ll never admit. While Tovah finds comfort in their Jewish religion, Adina rebels against its rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the results come in, one twin tests negative for Huntington’s. The other tests positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These opposite outcomes push them farther apart as they wrestle with guilt, betrayal, and the unexpected thrill of first love. How can they repair their relationship, and is it even worth saving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From debut author Rachel Lynn Solomon comes a luminous, heartbreaking tale of life, death, and the fragile bond between sisters.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the men of &lt;i&gt;Oxford &lt;/i&gt;magazine! In the first captivating spin-off of Lauren Layne’s Sex, Love &amp;amp; Stiletto series, a not-so-friendly battle of the sexes turns into a scorching office romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Hotshot sports editor Cole Sharpe has been freelancing for &lt;i&gt;Oxford&lt;/i&gt; for years, so when he hears about a staff position opening up, he figures he’s got the inside track. Then his boss drops a bombshell: Cole has competition. &lt;i&gt;Female&lt;/i&gt; competition, in the form of a fresh-faced tomboy who can hang with the dudes—and write circles around them, too. Cole usually likes his women flirty and curvy, but he takes a special interest in his skinny, sassy rival, if only to keep an eye on her. And soon, he can’t take his eyes &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; her.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Penelope Pope knows all too well that she comes off as just one of the guys. Since she’s learned that wanting more usually leads to disappointment, Penelope’s resigned to sitting on the sidelines when it comes to love. So why does Cole make her want to get back in the game? The man is as arrogant as he is handsome. He probably sees her as nothing more than a barrier to his dream job. But when an unexpected kiss turns into a night of irresistible passion, Penelope has to figure out whether they’re just fooling around—or starting something real.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Alice Clayton and Emma Chase, Lauren Layne’s Oxford series heats up in this story of forbidden desire as a brooding jock hoping for a comeback falls for a woman who’s strictly off-limits.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago, Jackson Burke was married to the love of his life and playing quarterback for the Texas Redhawks. Now he’s retired, courtesy of the car accident that ruined his career—and single, after a nasty scandal torpedoed his marriage. Just as he’s starting to get used to his new life as a health and fitness columnist for Oxford magazine, his unpredictable ex shows up on his doorstep in Manhattan. Jackson should be thrilled. But he can’t stop thinking about the one person who’s always been there for him, the one girl he could never have: her younger sister.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mollie Carrington can’t say no to Madison. After all, her older sister practically raised her. So when Madison begs for help in winning her ex-husband back, Mollie’s just glad she got over her own crush on Jackson ages ago—or so she thought. Because as Mollie reconnects with Jackson, she quickly forgets all her reasons to stay loyal to her sister. Tempted by Jackson’s mellow drawl and cowboy good looks, Mollie is sick and tired of coming in second place. But she can’t win if she doesn’t play the game.</description>

  <description>A modern classic in the making, this hilarious and heartwarming story explores the true meaning of family and friendship, and will delight fans of Pippi Longstocking. Speed and self-confidence, that's Astrid Glimmerdal's motto. And her hair-raising escapades give her plenty of opportunity to practise both. Nicknamed "the little thunderbolt", Astrid loves to spend her days racing down the hillside on her sledge or skis. But poor Astrid longs for other children to come to her village and join her adventures. Instead, she has to put up with a grumpy old seventy-four year old for a best friend (although secretly, she knows she wouldn't have it any other way). Astrid's world is about to be turned upside down, however, first by the arrival of a strange family, and then a mystery woman. Her best friend, Gunnvald, has been keeping a secret from her - one that will test their friendship to its limits. Everything is changing in Astrid's valley, and she's not sure she likes it. Reminiscent of Pippi Longstocking, Heidi and Anne Shirley, Astrid is a feisty and irrepressible heroine who will help readers navigate the complexities of family and friendship with plenty of warmth, wit and humour.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the Billionaire Bad Boys series comes the conclusion to the hilarious Chandler Brothers series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the eldest of three rebel-rousing brothers, Chase Chandler has waited a long time to leave his small-town roots behind. All bets are off when the single journalist meets a redhead who arouses a lot more than lust. Yet Sloane Carlisle isn't just any woman. She's a senator's daughter who is about to thrust him into the eye of a breaking political scandal-and a shot at a story that's already making headlines. All Chase has to do for an exclusive is keep her out of harm's way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman who refuses to play the Washington game, Sloane has just been hit with a bombshell that calls her entire identity into question. Feeling vulnerable, she does something completely out of character: She spends an incredible, passionate night with a handsome stranger. The last thing she expects is to ever see him again. But when she goes to the Chandlers' hometown of Yorkshire Falls to uncover the truth about her family, there he is! Not only that, her sometime amour Chase Chandler is sticking closer than a Capitol Hill groupie and igniting more sparks than the Fourth of July. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly a guy who has always steered clear of marriage is falling for a serious-minded woman with a family secret that could land them both in danger. If they survive the fallout, what will it take to get Sloane to say the two words that could turn the town's most eligible bachelor into the world's sexiest spouse?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Crush: a strong and often short-lived infatuation, particularly for someone beyond your reach…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that's inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the whip smart and charming &lt;i&gt;Trouble Brewing &lt;/i&gt;comes a fast-paced story about a female football coach that will have you laughing out loud and cheering for the home team as you wait for the final whistle of the game. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Connor McGuire loses out on his dream job of being the head coach of the local high school football team, he thinks life can’t get any worse. Then he discovers just who got the coveted position—it was a handout to the kid of a well-known, successful college coach. Connor’s sure this is just a publicity stunt, but the kid turns out to be not only a sharp strategist, but a driven and sexy young woman, too. Frustrated in more ways than one, Connor realizes that he might have to step up his game or risk losing altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Coach Charlotte “Charlie” Gibb calls a flag on the play when she finds out that her very male, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; attractive, but definitely-rooting-for-her-to-lose assistant coach resents her for taking what he considers to be his rightful position. But never one to back down from a little healthy competition, Charlie is determined to prove her worth—both on and off the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Baltsar’s “sweet, funny, witty, addictive writing,” (&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Samantha Young) is not to be missed!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can you fall in love with someone you've never even met?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailey Taylor Emery has a hunch that her favorite client at Fetch—an anonymous virtual assistant service—is actually hockey star Matt Eriksson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it's against the rules for her to check his file, she's 95% sure she spends at least part of each day texting with her lifelong crush and catering to his every need. Still nursing a wounded heart thanks to her recent breakup, Hailey is perfectly content with some harmless online flirting... until she has to meet her client. Face to face. Cue: utter panic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matt Eriksson is no stranger to heartbreak. He's still not over the destruction of his marriage, and it sucks to be the only guy on the team who knows the truth—that hockey and long-term relationships are a toxic mix. He barely sees his kids, and dealing with his ex makes him feel insane. The only person in his life who seems to understand is someone who won't show her pretty face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it's nothing that a pair of fourth row hockey seats can't fix. Hailey can't resist the offer. Matt can't resist Hailey. Good thing he doesn't have to. Fire up the kiss cam!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains rabid hockey fans, misunderstood dick pics, hockey players at the opera and exploding ovaries.</description>

  <description>There isn't a woman in town who's immune to the legendary Chandler charm. Yet so far single cop Rick Chandler has managed to fend off the marriage-minded advances of Yorkshire Falls' entire female population. A past mistake has taught him never to put his heart on the line ... until he answers the SOS of a real-life runaway bride. In spite of her pearly gown and tiara, Kendall Sutton vows to never wed- which makes her the ideal pretend lover who can ward off Rick's legion of admirers. When their passionate charade flames into the real thing, Rick is suddenly thinking about two words that spell forever after. But will Kendall ever say "I do?" Can a woman who's had it with weddings tie the knot with the town's most popular playboy?</description>

      <![CDATA[I am really enjoying this series. As always, the family dynamic was a lot of fun, but I thought this pairing was pretty fantastic too. Their meet-cute was sort of hilarious, and they had great chemistry, but it was the idea of finally putting down roots and finding a family that I really loved. <br /><br /><a href="http://weliveandbreathebooks.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">...</a>]]>

They tried to convince her to mend her ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's stuck working for the top-secret company Project Scrooge--as the latest Ghost of Christmas Past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, they save another miserly grouch. Every year, Holly stays frozen at seventeen while her family and friends go on living without her. So far, Holly's afterlife has been miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, everything is about to change. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;After her estranged brother suddenly dies, a girl embarks on a road trip to rediscover who her brother really was in this contemporary YA novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ellie's estranged brother, Luke, dies in a car accident, she's not sure whether to be devastated that she lost the person who was once her best friend or enraged, still, that he left without a word a year ago. Now, the only people who seem to understand what she's going through are Luke's best friend and his ex-girlfriend, who she bonds with over their desire to figure out where Luke went when he walked out of their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets closer to them, and closer to Cade, a boy who seems determined to get to know her better, she realizes that she’s not the only one with reasons to be angry at Luke. And when Ellie makes a discovery that changes everything, she and her new friends hit the road, hoping that following Luke's trail will bring them answers about the life Luke was living away from them.</description>

  <description>Foreign correspondent Roman Chandler has always prized his freedom above all else. Now losing a coin toss has sealed this youngest brother’s fate. Finding someone to escort down the aisle is the easy part—every wannabe bride in sleepy Yorkshire Falls is itching to get hitched to this gorgeous, globe-trotting Chandler man. But Roman still lusts after the woman who got away. Stunning heartbreaker Charlotte Bronson has come home to put down roots and get her erotic lingerie business off the ground. She wants a man that won’t go chasing off to the far corners of the earth for a breaking news story. He wants her to say “I do.”</description>

      <![CDATA[This was fun. I definitely loved the dynamic the brothers shared, and their mother's scheme, though a little underhanded, played out in a cute way. Roman and Charlotte were fabulous together. They had great chemistry and their banter was top notch. I had fun visiting this small town, and am looki...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Ocean's 11&lt;/i&gt; in this intrigue-filled contemporary drama from acclaimed author Kristen &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simmons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Vale Hall, the school for aspiring con artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Brynn Hilder is recruited to Vale, it seems like the elite academy is her chance to start over, away from her mom's loser boyfriend and her rundown neighborhood. But she soon learns that Vale chooses students not so much for their scholastic talent as for their extracurricular activities, such as her time spent conning rich North Shore kids out of their extravagant allowances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Brynn jumps at the chance to help the school in its mission to rid the city of corrupt officials--because what could be better than giving entitled jerks what they deserve? But that's before she meets her mark--a senator's son--and before she discovers the school's headmaster has secrets he'll stop at nothing to protect. As the lines between right and wrong blur, Brynn begins to realize she's in way over head.</description>

      <![CDATA[On the surface, this does not appear to be my usual cup of tea, but Simmons incorporated several elements, that had me chomping at the bit to read this one.<br /><br />1. Based on Norse mythology<br />2. Shades of Ocean's 11<br />3. An elite, top-secret boarding school<br /><br />And let me tell...]]>
