  <description>Zoe and Hank (short for Hannah) have been inseparable since they met in elementary school. The leader of the pack, Zoe is effortlessly popular while Hank hides comfortably in her shadow. But when Zoe's parents unexpectedly divorce, Zoe's perfect facade starts cracking little by little. Sinking under the weight of her broken family, Zoe develops an eating disorder. Now she must rely on Hank for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank struggles to help Zoe; after all, she is used to agreeing, not leading. How can she help her best friend get better before it's too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written partially in letters from Zoe and mostly in narrative from Hank's perspective, &lt;i&gt;Miss You Love You Hate You Bye &lt;/i&gt;is a poignant and eye-opening novel about friendship, mental health, and learning to put yourself first.</description>

  <description>Summer, 1518. A strange sickness sweeps through Strasbourg: women dance in the streets, some until they fall down dead. As rumors of witchcraft spread, suspicion turns toward Lavinia and her family, and Lavinia may have to do the unimaginable to save herself and everyone she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five centuries later, a pair of red shoes seal to Rosella Oliva’s feet, making her dance uncontrollably. They draw her toward a boy who knows the dancing fever’s history better than anyone: Emil, whose family was blamed for the fever five hundred years ago. But there’s more to what happened in 1518 than even Emil knows, and discovering the truth may decide whether Rosella survives the red shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With McLemore's signature lush prose, &lt;i&gt;Dark and Deepest Red&lt;/i&gt; pairs the forbidding magic of a fairy tale with a modern story of passion and betrayal.</description>

  <description>Quinn and Grayson have been fierce speech and debate rivals for years. They can't stand one another, either in competition or in real life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their AP Government teacher returns their school assignments to the wrong cubbies, they begin exchanging anonymous notes without knowing who the other is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their differences, the two come together through their letters and find themselves unknowingly falling for the competition. Before the state tournament, the two of them need to figure out what they want out of life, or risk their own future happiness. After all, what’s the point of speech and debate if you can't say what's in your heart?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is an excellent read! Right away I’m hooked on this story when I read on how competitive Quinn is and how her mouth “twisted in distaste” when she hears of her competitor’s name. I’m the same way as Quinn on study and homework. I take a lot of time and it’s definitely unfair when others...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; New Yorker &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“20 Under 40” author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Atmospheric Disturbances &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;comes a brain-twisting adventure story of a girl named Fred on a quest through a world of fantastical creatures, strange logic, and a powerful prejudice against growing up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred and her math-teacher mom are always on the move, and Fred is getting sick of it. She’s about to have yet another birthday in a new place without friends. On the eve of turning thirteen, Fred sees something strange in the living room: her mother, dressed for a party, standing in front of an enormous paper lantern—which she steps into and disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred follows her and finds herself in the Land of Impossibility—a loopily illogical place where time is outlawed, words carry dire consequences, and her unlikely allies are a depressed white elephant and a pugnacious mongoose mother of seventeen. With her new friends, Fred sets off in search of her mom, braving dungeons, Insult Fish, Fearsome Ferlings, and a mad Rat Queen. To succeed, the trio must find the solution to an ageless riddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeously illustrated and reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;, Rivka Galchen’s Rat Rule 79 is an instant classic for curious readers of all ages.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love the activities Fred and her mom play with paper and pen. This adventure book is interesting. I like Downer the elephant because he's not afraid to fail so he's not afraid to try new things. I like that this story promotes thinking outside the box because of word play between Fred and the O...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Other Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Justice for Sara&lt;/i&gt; comes a thrilling psychological drama about a woman who believes she escaped a brutal murder years ago—but does anyone else believe her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna Scott grew up in the dark shadow of her mother’s paranoid delusions. Now, she's returned home to confront her past and the unsolved murder that altered the course of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her mother’s shuttered house, an old fear that has haunted Sienna for years rears its ugly head —that it was she who had been the killer’s target that night. And now, with it, a new fear—that the killer not only intended to remedy his past mistake—he’s already begun. But are these fears any different from the ones that torment her mother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the walls close in, the line between truth and lie, reality and delusion disintegrate. Has Sienna’s worst nightmare come true? Or will she unmask a killer and finally prove she may be her mother’s look-alike, but she’s not her clone?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A husband's secret life, a wife's new beginning: escape to the Caribbean with #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elin Hilderbrand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene Steele shares her idyllic life in a beautiful Iowa City Victorian house with a husband who loves her to sky-writing, sentimental extremes. But as she rings in the new year one cold and snowy night, everything she thought she knew falls to pieces with a shocking phone call: her beloved husband, away on business, has been killed in a helicopter crash. Before Irene can even process the news, she must first confront the perplexing details of her husband's death on the distant Caribbean island of St. John.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Irene and her sons arrive at this faraway paradise, they make yet another shocking discovery: her husband had been living a secret life. As Irene untangles a web of intrigue and deceit, and as she and her sons find themselves drawn into the vibrant island culture, they have to face the truth about their family, and about their own futures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich with the lush beauty of the tropics and the drama, romance, and intrigue only Elin Hilderbrand can deliver, &lt;i&gt;Winter in Paradise&lt;/i&gt; is a truly transporting novel, and the exciting start to a new series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning debut novel about a teenage girl and her mother as they grapple with first love, family secrets, and tragedy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddy is sixteen. Smart, funny, and profound, she has loyal friends, a mother with whom she’s unusually close, a father she’s never met, devoted grandparents, and a crush on a boy named Jack. Maddy also has cancer. Living in the shadow of uncertainty, she is forced to grow up fast.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the Water in the World &lt;/i&gt;is the story of a family doing its best when faced with the worst. Told in the alternating voices of Maddy and her mother, Eve, the narrative moves between the family’s lake house in Pennsylvania; their home in Washington, DC; and London, where Maddy’s father, Antonio, lives. Hungry for experience, Maddy seeks out her first romantic relationship, finds solace in music and art, and tracks down Antonio. She continually tests the depths and limits of her closeness with her mother, while Eve has to come to terms with the daughter she only partly knows, in a world she can’t control.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With unforgettable voices that range from tender to funny, despairing to defiant, this novel illuminates the transformative power of love, humor, and hope.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is a great read! I like Maddy’s easy going relationship with her grandparents. Her and Jack’s interest in the environment is surprising because they are young and they care about the earth’s health. Additionally, I find it surprising also that Maddy doesn’t embrace social media like mos...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A girl searches for a killer on an island where deadly sirens lurk just beneath the waves in this gripping, atmospheric debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The sea holds many secrets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moira Alexander has always been fascinated by the deadly sirens who lurk along the shores of her island town. Even though their haunting songs can lure anyone to a swift and watery grave, she gets as close to them as she can, playing her violin on the edge of the enchanted sea. When a young boy is found dead on the beach, the islanders assume that he's one of the sirens’ victims. Moira isn’t so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain that someone has framed the boy’s death as a siren attack, Moira convinces her childhood friend, the lighthouse keeper Jude Osric, to help her find the real killer, rekindling their friendship in the process. With townspeople itching to hunt the sirens down, and their own secrets threatening to unravel their fragile new alliance, Moira and Jude must race against time to stop the killer before it’s too late—for humans and sirens alike.</description>

It’s about a girl sleuthing a murder because she believes the killer is not who the police says it is. This book is slow going all the way through. It spar...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;i&gt; comes another page-turning look inside one family’s past as buried secrets threaten to come to light. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you let in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Family Upstairs, the master of “bone-chilling suspense” (People) brings us the can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.</description>

  <description>In the city of Craewick, memories reign. The power-obsessed ruler of the city, Madame, has cultivated a society in which memories are currency, citizens are divided by ability, and Gifted individuals can take memories from others through touch as they please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Etta Lark is desperate to live outside of the corrupt culture, but grapples with the guilt of an accident that has left her mother bedridden in the city’s asylum. When Madame threatens to put her mother up for auction, a Craewick practice in which a “criminal's" memories are sold to the highest bidder before being killed, Etta will do whatever it takes to save her. Even if it means rejoining the Shadows, the rebel group she swore off in the wake of the accident years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove her allegiance to the Shadows and rescue her mother, Etta must steal a memorized map of the Maze, a formidable prison created by the bloodthirsty ruler of a neighboring Realm. So she sets out on a journey in which she faces startling attacks, unexpected romance, and, above all, her own past in order to set things right in her world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her debut novel, award-winning poet Brynne Rebele-Henry re-imagines the Orpheus myth as a love story between two teenage girls who are sent to conversion therapy after being caught together in an intimate moment. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by a single mother she never knew, 16-year-old Raya—obsessed with ancient myths—lives with her grandmother in a small conservative Texas town. For years Raya has been forced to hide her feelings for her best friend and true love, Sarah. When the two are outed, they are sent to Friendly Saviors: a re-education camp meant to “fix” them and make them heterosexual. Upon arrival, Raya vows to assume the mythic role of Orpheus to escape Friendly Saviors, and to return to the world of the living with her love—only becoming more determined after she, Sarah, and Friendly Saviors' other teen residents are subjected to abusive "treatments" by the staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a haunting voice reminiscent of Sylvia Plath, with the contemporary lyricism of David Levithan, Brynne Rebele-Henry weaves a powerful inversion of the Orpheus myth informed by the real-world truths of conversion therapy. &lt;i&gt;Orpheus Girl&lt;/i&gt; is a mythic story of dysfunctional families, trauma, first love, heartbreak, and ultimately, the fierce adolescent resilience that has the power to triumph over darkness and ignorance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CW: There are scenes in this book that depict self-harm, homophobia, transphobia, and violence against LGBTQ characters. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From acclaimed horror writer Sarah Lotz, hailed by Stephen King as "vastly entertaining," a new novel about a group of amateur detectives infiltrated by the sadistic killer whose case they're investigating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Reclusive Irish bookseller Shaun Ryan has always believed that his older brother, Teddy, died in a car accident. It's only on his mother's deathbed that he learns the truth: Teddy, who was gay, fled the Catholic, deeply conservative County Wicklow for New York decades earlier. Shaun finds no sign of him in New York or anywhere else--until he comes across the unsolved murder of a John Doe whose description matches Teddy's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for information, Shaun tracks down Chris Guzman, a woman who runs a website dedicated to matching missing persons cases with unidentified bodies. Through Chris's site, a group of online cold case fanatics connect Teddy with the notorious "Boy in the Dress" murder, believed to be one of many committed by a serial killer targeting gay men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who are these cold case fanatics, and how do they know so much about a case that left the police and the FBI stumped? With investigators, amateurs, and one sadistic killer on a collision course, &lt;i&gt;Missing Person&lt;/i&gt; is Sarah Lotz at her most thrilling and terrifying.</description>

  <description>The day Raquel has been dreading for months has finally arrived. Sasha, her best friend in the whole world -- the best friend in the whole world -- has died of cancer. Raquel can’t imagine life without her. She’s overwhelmed and brokenhearted.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then a letter from Sasha arrives. Has she somehow found a way to communicate from the afterlife?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, Sasha has planned an elaborate scavenger hunt for Raquel, and when she follows the instructions to return to Sasha’s grave, a mysterious stranger with striking eyes is waiting for her. There’s a secret attached to this boy that only Sasha—and now Raquel—knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This boy, Elijah, might be just what Raquel needs to move on from her terrible loss. But can Raquel remain true to herself while also honoring her friend’s final wish?</description>

There, she finds herself lured by the promise of friendship, love, starry skies, and wild parties.

  <description>For fifteen-year-old Shamiso, struggling with grief and bewilderment following her father's death, hope is nothing but a leap into darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Tanyaradzwa, whose life has been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis, hope is the only reason to keep fighting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two of them form an unlikely friendship, Shamiso begins to confront her terrible fear of loss. In getting close to another person, particularly someone who's ill, isn't she just opening herself up to more pain? And underpinning it all - what did happen to her father, the night of that strange and implausible car crash?</description>

I like Tanyaradzwa because she's nice despite her shortcomings. The main character, Shamiso, 15, takes a bit of time for me to get us...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An inventive and riveting epic saga, &lt;em&gt;After the Flood &lt;/em&gt;signals the arrival of an extraordinary new talent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more than a century from now, our world has been utterly transformed. After years of slowly overtaking the continent, rising floodwaters have obliterated America’s great coastal cities and then its heartland, leaving nothing but an archipelago of mountaintop colonies surrounded by a deep expanse of open water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubbornly independent Myra and her precocious seven-year-old daughter, Pearl, fish from their small boat, the &lt;em&gt;Bird&lt;/em&gt;, visiting dry land only to trade for supplies and information in the few remaining outposts of civilization. For seven years, Myra has grieved the loss of her oldest daughter, Row, who was stolen by her father after a monstrous deluge overtook their home in Nebraska. Then, in a violent confrontation with a stranger, Myra suddenly discovers that Row was last seen in a far-off encampment near the Artic Circle. Throwing aside her usual caution, Myra and Pearl embark on a perilous voyage into the icy northern seas, hoping against hope that Row will still be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their journey, Myra and Pearl join forces with a larger ship and Myra finds herself bonding with her fellow seekers who hope to build a safe haven together in this dangerous new world. But secrets, lust, and betrayals threaten their dream, and after their fortunes take a shocking—and bloody—turn, Myra can no longer ignore the question of whether saving Row is worth endangering Pearl and her fellow travelers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compulsively readable novel of dark despair and soaring hope, &lt;em&gt;After the Flood &lt;/em&gt;is a magnificent, action packed, and sometimes frightening odyssey laced with wonder—an affecting and wholly original saga both redemptive and astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>It all begins on a Monday, when four people board an elevator in a Manhattan office tower. Each presses a button for their floor, but the elevator proceeds, non-stop, to the top. Once there, it stops for a few seconds, and then plummets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right to the bottom of the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be a horrific, random tragedy. But then, on Tuesday, it happens again, in a different Manhattan skyscraper. And when Wednesday brings yet another high-rise catastrophe, one of the most vertical cities in the world—and the nation’s capital of media, finance, and entertainment—is plunged into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this is anything but random. This is a cold, calculated bid to terrorize the city. And it’s working. Fearing for their lives, thousands of men in women working in offices across the city refuse leave their homes. Commerce has slowed to a trickle. Emergency calls to the top floors of apartment buildings go unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is behind this? Why are they doing it? What do these deadly acts of sabotage have to do with the fingerless body found on the High Line? Two seasoned New York detectives and a straight-shooting journalist must race against time to find the answers before the city’s newest, and tallest, residential tower has its Friday night ribbon-cutting.</description>

  <description>For the first time in 20 years, Ann Cleeves—international bestselling and award-winning author of the Vera and Shetland series, both of which are hit TV shows—embarks on a gripping new series.&lt;br /&gt;In North Devon, where two rivers converge and run into the sea, Detective Matthew Venn stands outside the church as his father’s funeral takes place. Once loved and cherished, the day Matthew left the strict evangelical community he grew up in, he lost his family too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as he turns and walks away again, he receives a call from one of his team. A body has been found on the beach nearby: a man with a tattoo of an albatross on his neck, stabbed to death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case calls Matthew back into the community he thought he had left behind, as deadly secrets hidden at its heart are revealed, and his past and present collide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An astonishing new novel told with compassion and searing insight, The Long Call will captivate fans of Vera and Shetland, as well as new readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;What She Knew&lt;/em&gt; conjures a dark and unpredictable tale of family secrets that explores the lengths people will go to hurt one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her beloved nanny, Hannah, left without a trace in the summer of 1988, seven-year-old Jocelyn Holt was devastated. Haunted by the loss, Jo grew up bitter and distant, and eventually left her parents and Lake Hall, their faded aristocratic home, behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, Jo returns to the house and is forced to confront her troubled relationship with her mother. But when human remains are accidentally uncovered in a lake on the estate, Jo begins to question everything she thought she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an unexpected visitor knocks on the door and Jo’s world is destroyed again. Desperate to piece together the gaping holes in her memory, Jo must uncover who her nanny really was, why she left, and if she can trust her own mother…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compulsively readable tale of secrets, lies, and deception, Gilly Macmillan explores the darkest impulses and desires of the human heart. Diabolically clever, &lt;em&gt;The Nanny&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that sometimes the truth hurts so much you’d rather hear the lie.</description>

  <description>In this heartfelt, funny, touching memoir, Tan France, star of Netflix’s smash-hit QUEER EYE, tells his origin story for the first time. With his trademark wit, humor, and radical compassion, Tan reveals what it was like to grow up gay in a traditional Muslim family, as one of the few people of color in Doncaster, England. He illuminates his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life--a Mormon cowboy from Salt Lake City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Tan's own words, “The book is meant to spread joy, personal acceptance, and most of all understanding. Each of us is living our own private journey, and the more we know about each other, the healthier and happier the world will be.”</description>

  <description>In this dark, suspenseful thriller, Alex North weaves a multi-generational tale of a father and son caught in the crosshairs of an investigation to catch a serial killer preying on a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his wife, Tom Kennedy believes a fresh start will help him and his young son Jake heal. A new beginning, a new house, a new town. Featherbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed "The Whisper Man," for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window...</description>

      <![CDATA[Awesome read! Definitely creepy following Tom’s view and heartbreaking following Pete’s view. Pete sounds like a great Detective. He cares a lot for the victims and will not rest until they are found. I like that the author includes the killer’s view. I like the cliffhangers at the end of each ch...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Instant national bestseller Nathan Ripley follows up the success of&lt;i&gt; Find You in the Dark &lt;/i&gt;with another suspenseful page-turner&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;this time about a woman whose notorious father died when she was a child, but whose legacy comes back to haunt her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blanche Potter never expected to face her past again—but she can’t escape it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blanche, an up-and-coming filmmaker, has distanced herself in every way she can from her father, the notorious killer and cult leader, Chuck Varner. In 1996, when she was a small child, he went on a shooting spree before turning the gun on himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Blanche learns that her mother has been murdered. She returns to her childhood home, where she soon discovers there’s more to the death than police are willing to reveal. The officer who’s handling the case is holding information back, and a journalist who’s nosing around the investigation is taking an unusual interest in Blanche’s family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blanche begins to suspect that Chuck Varner’s cult has found a new life, and that her mother’s murder was just the beginning of the cult’s next chapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then another killing occurs.</description>

A bit of a slow start but got interesting with the twist on Blanche’s mom and many unexpected surprises and twists I didn’t see coming to different characters including Blanche. The killer’s strategy is good and creative when involving many people. I like following Dete...]]>

  <description>10 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A disturbing and shocking debut novel of psychological suspense about a recently widowed mother, her young son, and the lengths she'll go to in order to keep him safe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tess Clarke wakes up in the hospital the day after her son Jamie's eighth birthday, she's sure of these things: She's been stabbed, her son is missing, her brother-in-law and her grief counselor are involved. But no one is listening to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her husband, Mark, died suddenly in a terrible accident a few months earlier, the only thing keeping Tess together is Jamie. As they struggle to make sense of their new life without Mark, they find joy in brief moments of normalcy like walking to school and watching television together. Life is hard without Mark, but Tess has Jamie, and that's what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there in the hospital, confused and surrounded by people who won't listen, Tess’s world falls apart. To save her son, she must piece together what happened between Mark's death and Jamie's birthday, but the truth might just be too much for her to bear.</description>

      <![CDATA[I started reading The Perfect Son on 6/30/2019 and finished it on 7/6/2019. This book is an okay read. A slow start to the first 300 pages with readers not knowing much of what’s going on.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This page-turning, harrowing debut is the story of a girl trying to fit in, whose obsessive new friends and desperation to belong leads her to places she'd never imagined...dark, dangerous, and possibly even violent. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1998, a sixteen-year-old girl is found dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's posed on a swing on her boarding school's property, dressed all in white, with no known cause of death. Whispers and rumors swirl, with no answers. But there are a few who know what happened; there is one girl who will never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year earlier: a new student, Violet, steps on the campus of Elm Hollow Academy, an all-girl's boarding school on the outskirts of a sleepy coastal town. This is her fresh start, her chance to begin again in the wake of tragedy, leave her demons behind. Bright but a little strange, uncertain and desperate to fit in, she soon finds herself invited to an advanced study group, led by her alluring and mysterious art teacher, Annabel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, with three other girls--Alex, Grace, and Robin--the five of them delve into the school's long-buried grim history: of Greek and Celtic legends; of the school founder's "academic" interest in the occult; of gruesome 17th century witch trials. Annabel does her best to convince the girls that her classes aren't related to ancient rites and rituals, and that they are just history and mythology. But the more she tries to warn the girls off the topic, the more they drawn to it, and the possibility that they can harness magic for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet quickly finds herself wrapped up in this heady new world of lawless power--except she is needled by the disappearance of a former member of the group, one with whom Violet shares an uncanny resemblance. As her friends' actions take a turn for the darker and spiral out of control, she begins to wonder who she can trust, all the while becoming more deeply entangled. How far will these young girls go to protect one another...or to destroy one another?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A darkly funny and life-affirming debut novel for readers of &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; the story of one man who is offered a second chance at life and love when he develops an unexpected friendship--if he can expose the white lie he told years ago that grew into so much more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew's day-to-day is a little grim, searching for next of kin for those who die alone. Thankfully, he has a loving family waiting for him when he gets home, to help wash the day's cares away. At least, that's what his coworkers believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew didn't mean for the misunderstanding to happen, yet he's become trapped in his own white lie. The fantasy of his wife and two kids has become a pleasant escape from his lonely one bedroom with only his Ella Fitzgerald records for company. But when new employee Peggy breezes into his life like a breath of fresh air, Andrew is shaken out of his routine. She doesn't notice the wall he's been safely hiding behind and their friendship promises to break it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew must choose: Does he tell the truth and start really living his life, but risk losing his friendship with Peggy? Or will he stay safe and alone, behind the façade? &lt;i&gt;How Not to Die Alone &lt;/i&gt;is about the importance of taking a chance in those moments when we have the most to lose. Sharp and funny, warm and real, it's the kind of big-hearted story we all need.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the celebrated and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Banker's Wife&lt;/i&gt;, worlds collide when an FBI agent investigates a string of grisly murders on Long Island that raises the impossible question: What happens when the primary suspect is your father?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Agent Nell Flynn hasn't been home in ten years. Nell and her father, Homicide Detective Martin Flynn, have never had much of a relationship. And Suffolk County will always be awash in memories of her mother, Marisol, who was brutally murdered when Nell was just seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Martin Flynn dies in a motorcycle accident, Nell returns to the house she grew up in so that she can spread her father's ashes and close his estate. At the behest of her father's partner, Detective Lee Davis, Nell becomes involved in an investigation into the murders of two young women in Suffolk County. The further Nell digs, the more likely it seems to her that her father should be the prime suspect--and that his friends on the police force are covering his tracks. Plagued by doubts about her mother's murder--and her own role in exonerating her father in that case--Nell can't help but ask questions about who killed Ria Ruiz and Adriana Marques and why. But she may not like the answers she finds--not just about those she loves, but about herself.</description>

  <description>“Marissa Stapley’s writing is a gift.”—Pam Jenoff, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of&lt;i&gt; The Orphan’s Tale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harmony Resort promises hope for struggling marriages. Run by celebrity power couple Drs. Miles and Grace Markell, the "last resort" offers a chance for partners to repair their relationships in a luxurious setting on the gorgeous Mayan Riviera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johanna and Ben have a marriage that looks perfect on the surface, but in reality, they don’t know each other at all. Shell and Colin fight constantly: after all, Colin is a workaholic, and Shell always comes second to his job as an executive at a powerful mining company. But what has really torn them apart is too devastating to talk about. When both couples begin Harmony's intensive therapy program, it becomes clear that Harmony is not all it seems—and neither are Miles and Grace themselves. What are they hiding, and what price will these couples pay for finding out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a deadly tropical storm descends on the coast, trapping the hosts and the guests on the resort, secrets are revealed, loyalties are tested and not one single person—or their marriage—will remain unchanged by what follows.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marissa Stapley is a journalist and the author of the acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;Things to Do When It's Raining&lt;/i&gt;. She writes page-turning, deeply emotional fiction about families, friends and women's lives. Visit her at marissastapley.com or follow her on Twitter, @marissastapley.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>Isabelle should be blissfully happy – she’s about to win the handsome prince. Except Isabelle isn’t the beautiful girl who lost the glass slipper and captured the prince’s heart. She’s the ugly stepsister who’s cut off her toes to fit into Cinderella’s shoe ... which is now filling with blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the prince discovers Isabelle’s deception, she is turned away in shame. It’s no more than she deserves: she is a plain girl in a world that values beauty; a feisty girl in a world that wants her to be pliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabelle has tried to fit in. To live up to her mother’s expectations. To be like her stepsister. To be sweet. To be pretty. One by one, she has cut away pieces of herself in order to survive a world that doesn’t appreciate a girl like her. And that has made her mean, jealous, and hollow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she gets a chance to alter her destiny and prove what ugly stepsisters have always known: it takes more than heartache to break a girl.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four women learn their boss (a man who’s always been surrounded by rumors about how he treats women) is next in line to be CEO—what will happen when they decide enough is enough?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane, Ardie, Grace, and Rosalita are four women who have worked at Truviv, Inc., for years. The sudden death of Truviv's CEO means their boss, Ames, will likely take over the entire company. Ames is a complicated man, a man they’ve all known for a long time, a man who’s always been surrounded by...whispers. Whispers that have always been ignored by those in charge. But the world has changed, and the women are watching Ames’s latest promotion differently. This time, they’ve decided enough is enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane and her colleagues set in motion a catastrophic shift within every floor and department of the Truviv offices. All four women’s lives—as women, colleagues, mothers, wives, friends, even adversaries—will change dramatically as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If only you had listened to us,” they tell us on page one, “none of this would have happened."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Michelle Ruiz Keil's #OwnVoices debut is a literary YA fantasy about love, found family, and healing--an ode to post-punk San Francisco through the eyes of a Mexican American girl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Seventeen-year-old Xochi is on her own in San Francisco, running from a painful past. On a visit to Golden Gate Park, she meets Pallas, a precocious twelve-year-old with a rockstar family that lives in one of the city's storybook Victorian mansions. Xochi accepts a position as Pallas's live-in governess and quickly becomes part of the band's household, fascinated by their free-love philosophy and the happy calm that balances out their glamorous music personas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the night of the Vernal Equinox, as a concert afterparty rages in the house below, Xochi and Pallas perform a pagan ritual that unintentionally summons a pair of ancient creatures devoted to righting the wrongs of Xochi's adolescence. She'd do anything to preserve her new life, but the nightmares of her past are never far behind: the mother who abandoned her, the man who betrayed her, and the loving grandmother whose death left Xochi alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the creatures determined to exact vengeance on those who've hurt her, no one in Xochi's life is safe--not the family she's chosen, nor the one she left behind.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Welcome to the Kingdom... where 'Happily Ever After' isn't just a promise, but a rule. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glimmering like a jewel behind its gateway, The Kingdom is an immersive fantasy theme park where guests soar on virtual dragons, castles loom like giants, and bioengineered species--formerly extinct--roam free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ana is one of seven Fantasists, beautiful "princesses" engineered to make dreams come true. When she meets park employee Owen, Ana begins to experience emotions beyond her programming including, for the first time... love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fairytale becomes a nightmare when Ana is accused of murdering Owen, igniting the trial of the century. Through courtroom testimony, interviews, and Ana's memories of Owen, emerges a tale of love, lies, and cruelty--and what it truly means to be human.</description>

  <description>From the USA Today bestselling author of All the Summer Girls and Dog Crazy comes a spellbinding and suspenseful tale inspired by Wuthering Heights that illuminates the ways in which hope—and even magic—can blossom in the darkest of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find her way, she must abandon everything she loves…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, Merrow Shawe believes she is born of the sea: strong, joyous, and wild. Her beloved home is Horseshoe Cliff, a small farm on the coast of Northern California where she spends her days exploring fog-cloaked bluffs, swimming in the cove, and basking in the light of golden sunsets as her father entertains her with fantastical stories. It is an enchanting childhood, but it is not without hardship—the mystery of Merrow’s mother’s death haunts her, as does the increasingly senseless cruelty of her older brother, Bear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, like sea glass carried from a distant land, Amir arrives in Merrow’s life. He’s been tossed about from India to New York City and now to Horseshoe Cliff, to stay with her family. Merrow is immediately drawn to his spirit, his passion, and his resilience in the face of Bear’s viciousness. Together they embrace their love of the sea, and their growing love for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ocean holds secrets in its darkest depths. When tragedy strikes, Merrow is forced to question whether Amir is really the person she believed him to be. In order to escape the danger she finds herself in and find her own path forward, she must let go of the only home she’s ever known, and the only boy she’s ever loved....</description>

  <description>From Jennifer Weiner, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Who Do You Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Her Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, comes a smart, thoughtful, and timely exploration of two sisters’ lives from the 1950s to the present as they struggle to find their places—and be true to themselves—in a rapidly evolving world. &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Everything&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a postapocalyptic take on the perennial classic "Little Red Riding Hood"...about a woman who isn't as defenseless as she seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not safe for anyone alone in the woods. There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse threats in the woods than the things that stalk their prey at night. Sometimes, there are men. Men with dark desires, weak wills, and evil intents. Men in uniform with classified information, deadly secrets, and unforgiving orders. And sometimes, just sometimes, there's something worse than all of the horrible people and vicious beasts combined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red doesn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she isn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she is a woman alone in the woods....</description>

  <description>There is a stranger outside Caroline's house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her spectacular new beach house, built for hosting expensive parties and vacationing with the family she thought she'd have. But her husband is lying to her and everything in her life is upside down, so when the stranger, Aiden, shows up as a bartender at the same party where Caroline and her husband have a very public fight, it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her marriage collapses around her and the lavish lifestyle she's built for herself starts to crumble, Caroline turns to Aiden for comfort...and revenge. After a brief and desperate fling that means nothing to Caroline and everything to him, Aiden's obsession with Caroline, her family, and her house grows more and more disturbing. And when Caroline's husband goes missing, her life descends into a nightmare that leaves her accused of her own husband's murder.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Will enchant your imagination." -Erin Entrada Kelly, Newbery Medal-Winning author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this heartfelt, magical instant classic, Megan Frazer Blakemore shows how the truths we tell can change the world. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alice was little, she found a gigantic spider web deep in the forest. Her dad called it the Story Web and told her how its strands were woven from the stories that hold our world together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Alice's dad has gone away for reasons Alice is sure are her fault. Now she won't even talk about her dad and definitely no longer believes his farfetched stories. But when animals in town start acting strangely, she can't ignore them. The Story Web is in danger--and the fabric of our world is breaking. The only way to mend it is to tell honest tales from the heart, even if they are difficult to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this magical tale of truth and honesty perfect for fans of Katherine Applegate, Megan Frazer Blakemore deftly weaves fantasy into the real world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adventure and discover with the bold and intrepid Becket Branch when her family’s move from city to a country farm means big changes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is changing for Becket Branch. From subways to sidewalks to safety rules, Becket is a city kid born and raised. Now the Branch family is trading urban bustle for big green fields and moving to Gran’s farm, where Becket has to make sense of new routines from feeding animals to baling hay. And as much as Becket loves to yell “Beautiful Alert!” there’s a lot about the countryside that is just plain odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Becket is ready to put her own spin on country life. Whether selling her mouth-puckering lemonade, feeding hostile hens, or trying to make a best friend of her new neighbor Frieda Franca, Becket is determined to use her city smarts to get a grip on farm living. Laugh and learn with Becket as she mucks through the messy, exuberant human experience of change she didn’t ask for, in a story that sparkles with quirky characters and lasting connections.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boyhood&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Sun Is Also a Star&lt;/i&gt; in this unconventional love story by award-winning author Meredith Russo!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two kids, Morgan and Eric, are bonded for life after being born on the same day at the same time. We meet them once a year on their shared birthday as they grow and change: as Eric figures out who he is and how he fits into the world, and as Morgan makes the difficult choice to live as her true self. Over the years, they will drift apart, come together, fight, make up, and break up—and ultimately, realize how inextricably they are a part of each other.</description>

  <description>Shane has been doing college all wrong. Pre-med, stellar grades, and happy parents…sounds ideal—but Shane's made zero friends, goes home every weekend, and romance…what’s that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life has been dorm, dining hall, class, repeat. Time's a ticking, and she needs a change—there's nothing like moving to a new country to really mix things up. Shane signs up for a semester abroad in London. She's going to right all her college mistakes: make friends, pursue boys, and find adventure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done. She is soon faced with the complicated realities of living outside her bubble, and when self-doubt sneaks in, her new life starts to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane comes to find that, with the right amount of courage and determination one can conquer anything. Throw in some fate and a touch of magic—the possibilities are endless.</description>

      <![CDATA[DNF few chapters into part 2. <br /><br />I started reading Again, but Better on 5/6/2019 and finished it on 5/8/2019. This is a book that I shouldn’t pick up based on the cover because the cover is cute. Right away I enjoyed the humor, especially when Shane slapped Pilot on their walk to the grocery store....]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;l Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt; is the brilliant tale of two stories. One is about Aimee Sinclair—well-known actress on the verge of being full-on famous. If you saw her, you’d think you knew her. One day towards the near-end of her shoot on her latest film, Aimee comes home from filming to find her husband’s cell phone and wallet on the dining room table. He never goes anywhere without them. But he’s nowhere to be found. She’s not too concerned—they had a huge fight the night before. They both said things they didn’t mean. He might have done things he didn’t mean, things she can’t forget. Even though she has a history of supposedly forgetting. After all, she’s a very good actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning she goes for her morning run and then goes to her favorite coffee shop. But her card is denied. When she calls the bank they say her account has been emptied of $10,000. She immediately suspects her husband. But they say no, it was Aimee herself who closed out the account. And thus begins a bizarre rabbit hole into which Aimee finds herself falling where nothing is at it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating with Aimee’s story is that of a little girl who wandered away from home. We always tell our kids not to talk to strangers or bad things will happen. Well, bad things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;I Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt;, Alice Feeney proves that she is a master at brilliantly complicated plots and twists after twists.</description>

  <description>Vincent, Jules, Sylvie, and Sam are ruthlessly ambitious high-flyers working in the lucrative world of Wall Street finance where deception and intimidation thrive. Getting rich is all that matters, and they'll do anything to reach the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they are ordered to participate in a corporate team-building exercise that requires them to escape from a locked elevator, dark secrets of their team begin to be laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest mystery to solve in this lethal game: What happened to Sara Hall? Once a young shining star—”now gone but not forgotten”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no longer a game. &lt;br /&gt;They’re fighting for their lives.</description>

  <description>Paris in 1789 is a labyrinth of twisted streets, filled with beggars, thieves, revolutionaries—and magicians...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When smallpox kills her parents, Camille Durbonne must find a way to provide for her frail, naive sister while managing her volatile brother. Relying on petty magic—la magie ordinaire—Camille painstakingly transforms scraps of metal into money to buy the food and medicine they need. But when the coins won’t hold their shape and her brother disappears with the family’s savings, Camille must pursue a richer, more dangerous mark: the glittering court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dark magic forbidden by her mother, Camille transforms herself into the ‘Baroness de la Fontaine’ and is swept up into life at the Palace of Versailles, where aristocrats both fear and hunger for la magie. There, she gambles at cards, desperate to have enough to keep herself and her sister safe. Yet the longer she stays at court, the more difficult it becomes to reconcile her resentment of the nobles with the enchantments of Versailles. And when she returns to Paris, Camille meets a handsome young balloonist—who dares her to hope that love and liberty may both be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But la magie has its costs. And when Camille loses control of her secrets, the game she's playing turns deadly. Then revolution erupts, and she must choose—love or loyalty, democracy or aristocracy, freedom or magic—before Paris burns…</description>

      <![CDATA[I started reading Enchantee on 10/30/2018 and finished it on 11/13/2018. This book is an excellent read! I enjoy reading about Paris life in 1789. It’s definitely sad to be among the poor and definitely fun to be among the rich. Nights at Versailles sounds magnificent. I like how gambling and hot...]]>

  <description>It is fall and juicy things are growing in Mr. Putter’s backyard--apples, tomatoes, and pears. Mr. Putter dreams of all the juicy things he loves to eat, but most of all, he dreams of pear jelly. There’s only one problem--cranky legs keep him from climbing up to pick the pears. His ingenious solution will have young readers cheering him on.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first book in a spooky new series for only the bravest of readers, perfect for fans of The Spiderwick Chronicles!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Anna and Max love scary stories--but when they find a mysterious knife on a dark and stormy knife, truth becomes stranger than fiction. Dragged into a world of monsters and magic, Max vanishes, and it's up to Anna to find him. Will the siblings find a way to survive?&lt;br /&gt;This deliciously creepy book is a modern Brothers Grimm tale, striking the perfect tone of eeriness--but is not so terrifying that readers can't sleep at night!</description>

  <description>Adventurous Cleo and couch potato Cornelius live in ancient Egypt, where cats are worshipped like gods and goddesses. After Cornelius accidentally boards a boat departing on a voyage across the sea, Cleo and Cornelius find themselves in the faraway city of Rome, a place where dogs are treated like kings.  In Rome, the activities never end! Cleo and Cornelius race chariots, play games, perform in a theater, and more. Do they even want to return to Egypt? A spin on Aesop’s classic fable “The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse,” Cleo and Cornelius is teeming with hungry hippos, toga-clad dogs, and dancing cat mummies, bringing new excitement to a timeless tale.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Police officer Ellery Hathaway and FBI profiler Reed Markham take on two difficult new cases in this stunning follow-up to &lt;i&gt;The Vanishing Season&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Mercy&lt;/i&gt; is award-winning author Joanna Schaffhausen’s heart-pounding second novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police officer Ellery Hathaway is on involuntary leave from her job because she shot a murderer in cold blood and refuses to apologize for it. Forced into group therapy for victims of violent crime, Ellery immediately finds higher priorities than “getting in touch with her feelings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, she suspects a fellow group member may have helped to convict the wrong man for a deadly arson incident years ago. For another, Ellery finds herself in the desperate clutches of a woman who survived a brutal rape. He is still out there, this man with the Spider-Man-like ability to climb through bedroom windows, and his victim beseeches Ellery for help in capturing her attacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellery seeks advice from her friend, FBI profiler Reed Markham, who liberated her from a killer’s closet when she was a child. Reed remains drawn to this unpredictable woman, the one he rescued but couldn’t quite save. The trouble is, Reed is up for a potential big promotion, and his boss has just one condition for the new job—stay away from Ellery. Ellery ignores all the warnings. Instead, she starts digging around in everyone’s past but her own—a move that, at best, could put her out of work permanently, and at worst, could put her in the city morgue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The plot is intriguing and I just couldn’t get enough of the main characters’ working relationship, their sharp tongue at each other and at interrogations is exhilarating.

  <description>Foster Stewart knows she's different. Her life has never been "normal." Talking to plants and controlling cloud formations aren't things most seventeen year olds are into. Tate "Nighthawk" Taylor is perfect. Star quarterback and all around dreamy boy next door he never thought about his "extra" abilities. What quarterback wouldn't want night vision? That's not weird, right? It's cool! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the night of their first meeting a deadly tornado brings them together and awakens their true abilities - the power to control the element air. Unbeknown to Tate and Foster, they are the first in a group of teens that were genetically manipulated before birth to bond with the elements. Which truly sucks for Foster, as she has to face the fact that Dr. Rick Stewart, her beloved scientist father, betrayed her and now wants to use her and the others for his own nefarious world domination plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foster and Tate must stop Dr. Stewart and his minions before he destroys their lives and the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Victorian Premier’s Literary Award, &lt;i&gt;The Nowhere Child&lt;/i&gt; is screenwriter Christian White’s internationally bestselling debut thriller of psychological suspense about a woman uncovering devastating secrets about her family—and her very identity…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly Leamy is a photography teacher in Melbourne, Australia. Twenty-six years earlier, Sammy Went, a two-year old girl vanished from her home in Manson, Kentucky. An American accountant who contacts Kim is convinced she was that child, kidnapped just after her birthday. She cannot believe the woman who raised her, a loving social worker who died of cancer four years ago, crossed international lines to steal a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On April 3rd, 1990, Jack and Molly Went’s daughter Sammy disappeared from the inside their Kentucky home. Already estranged since the girl’s birth, the couple drifted further apart as time passed. Jack did his best to raise and protect his other daughter and son while Molly found solace in her faith. The Church of the Light Within, a Pentecostal fundamentalist group who handle poisonous snakes as part of their worship, provided that faith. Without Sammy, the Wents eventually fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with proof that she and Sammy are in fact the same person, Kim travels to America to reunite with a family she never knew she had. And to solve the mystery of her abduction—a mystery that will take her deep into the dark heart of religious fanaticism where she must fight for her life against those determined to save her soul…</description>

  <description>Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It’s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret.

Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom’s teenaged son Freddie—a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5—excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Tom’s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she’s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems. For one thing, he has taken a particular liking to her best friend and fellow classmate, and Jenna’s mother—whose mental health has admittedly been deteriorating in recent years—is convinced that Mr. Fitzwilliam is stalking her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, twenty years earlier, a schoolgirl writes in her diary, charting her doomed obsession with a handsome young English teacher named Mr. Fitzwilliam…</description>

  <description>FINCHOSAURUS follows the adventures of Atticus Finch Martin, otherwise known as Finch. Finch’s dream is to uncover a dinosaur fossil and name a new species after himself—until he digs up a note in the fifth-grade class garden with the word HELP on it. He is determined to come to the aid of the mystery note-writer. But when the quest turns out to be harder than expected, Finch risks losing two things that he really wants—his best friend Noah, and a field trip to Dinosaur State Park.</description>

  <description>Lacey Barnes has dreamt of being in a movie for as long as she can remember. However, while her dream did include working alongside the hottest actor in Hollywood, it didn’t involve having to finish up her senior year of high school at the same time she was getting her big break. Although that is nothing compared to Donavan, the straight-laced student her father hires to tutor her, who is a full-on nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lacey struggles to juggle her burgeoning career, some on-set sabotage, and an off-screen romance with the unlikeliest of leading men, she quickly learns that sometimes the best stories happen when you go off script.</description>

I like that this thriller has a new angle, focusing on family and how serial killers affect their children. It’s definitely interesting when killers are portrayed as family people...]]>

  <description>In 1970 Vancouver, thirteen-year-old Charlotte and her best friend, Dawn, are keen to avoid the pitfalls of adolescence. Couldn't they just skip teenhood altogether, along with its annoying behaviors - showing off just because you have a boyfriend, obsessing about marriage and a ring and matching dining-room furniture? Couldn't one just learn about life from Jane Austen and spend the days eating breakfast at noon, watching "People in Conflict," and thrift-store shopping for cool castoffs to tie-dye for the upcoming outdoor hippie music festival?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life becomes more complicated when the girls meet a Texan draft dodger who comes to live with Charlotte's Quaker family. Tom Ed expands Charlotte's horizons as they discuss everything from war to civil disobedience to women's liberation. Grappling with exhilarating and disturbing new ideas, faced with a censorship challenge to her beloved English teacher and trying to decode the charismatic draft dodger himself, Charlotte finds it harder and harder to stick to her unteen philosophy, and to see eye to eye with Dawn.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;“You know how people always tell you ‘just be yourself?’ That’s terrible advice. You won’t survive middle school that way. Trust me.”&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spaulding Meriwether, Thedgeroot Middle School's new resident weirdo and son of questionable television ghost hunters, just wants to fit in. But after a revenant chases him through the woods, Spaulding suspects there’s something afoot in Thedgeroot. (At least he thinks it’s a foot. Maybe it was a hand. It’s hard to tell when you’re running away.)&lt;br /&gt; Then he notices the chimneys of the abandoned factory at the edge of town puffing smoke—and his dead next-door neighbor materializes, along with David, the missing pet boa constrictor that supposedly ate him. Spaulding can’t help wondering if these strange happenings have anything to do with his undead friends in the forest. Of course, Spaulding just &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to investigate—but he may be biting off more than he can chew.</description>

Until Aiden – one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party – can solve her murder, the day will repeat itself, over and over again. Every time ending with the fateful pistol shot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to break this cycle is to identify the killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of a different guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escaping Blackheath...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SELECTED AS A BOOK OF THE YEAR BY THE GUARDIAN, I PAPER, FINANCIAL TIMES AND DAILY TELEGRAPH.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling, razor-sharp debut novel about a woman whose obsession with the beautiful actress on her block drives her to the edge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve never crossed their little fenced-in garden, of course. I stand on the sidewalk in front of the fern-and-ivy-filled planter that hangs from the fence—placed there as a sort of screen, I’m sure—and have a direct line of view into the kitchen at night. I’m grateful they’ve never thought to install blinds. That’s how confident they are. No one would dare stand in front of our house and watch us, they think. And they’re probably right: except for me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this taut and thrilling debut, an unraveling woman, unhappily childless and recently separated, becomes fixated on her neighbor—the &lt;i&gt;actress. &lt;/i&gt;The unnamed narrator can’t help noticing with wry irony that, though she and the actress live just a few doors apart, a chasm of professional success and personal fulfillment lies between them. The actress, a celebrity with her face on the side of every bus, shares a gleaming brownstone with her handsome husband and their three adorable children, while the narrator, working in a dead-end job, lives in a run-down, three-story walk-up with her ex-husband’s cat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an interaction with the actress at the annual block party takes a disastrous turn, what began as an innocent preoccupation spirals quickly, and lethally, into a frightening and irretrievable madness. Searing and darkly witty, &lt;i&gt;Looker &lt;/i&gt;is enormously entertaining—at once a propulsive Hitchcockian thriller and a fearlessly original portrait of the perils of envy.</description>

  <description>Robin of Locksley is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maid Marian doesn’t know how she’ll go on, but the people of Locksley town, persecuted by the Sheriff of Nottingham, need a protector. And the dreadful Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff’s right hand, wishes to step into Robin’s shoes as Lord of Locksley &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Marian’s fiancé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is there to stop them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marian never meant to tread in Robin’s footsteps—never intended to stand as a beacon of hope to those awaiting his triumphant return. But with a sweep of his green cloak and the flash of her sword, Marian makes the choice to become her own hero: Robin Hood.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Neil Armstrong's journey to the moon is the focus of the fifteenth picture book in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series of biographies about heroes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves. Each book tells the story of one of America's icons in a lively, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers and that always includes the hero's childhood influences. At the back are an excellent timeline and photos. This volume tells the story of Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon.</description>

  <description>Eraser is always cleaning up everyone else’s mistakes. Except for Ruler and Pencil Sharpener, none of the other school supplies seem to appreciate her. They all love how sharp Pencil is and how Tape and Glue help everyone stick together. Eraser wants to create so that she can shine like the others. She decides to give it a try, but it’s not until the rubber meets the road that Eraser begins to understand a whole lot about herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a school essay their daughter Kate wrote in the third grade, the author and illustrator behind Theodor Seuss Geisel Award–winner &lt;i&gt;You Are (Not) Small&lt;/i&gt; have created a desktop drama about figuring out who you are, finding happiness, and the importance of second, third, and maybe even fourth chances.</description>

  <description>Ten years have passed since the Demon Lord Kranos declared war on mankind. As the situation grows desperate, the Ruxe Kingdom summons a hero from another world to stand against this threat. Assigned by the Church to join the hero's party, a battle-worn priest arrives to fulfill his obligations but is shocked to find that his companions are utterly inept! A mage who can only use fire magic, a swordswoman recently defected from her father's fighting school, and a hero obsessed with women?! With an average level totaling just 15, there's no way these novices are capable of taking down a demon lord! But a job's a job, so it's up to the man of God (who thankfully has power to spare) to support these buffoons from the shadows. With an extraordinary healer on their side, defeating their target will be a cinch! ...Hopefully.</description>

  <description>"&lt;i&gt;Christmas at the Cat Cafe &lt;/i&gt;is the wonderfully festive sequel to Melissa Daley's uplifting tale, &lt;i&gt;Molly and the Cat Cafe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Costwolds' town of Stourton-on-the-Hill has its very own cat cafe. Resident cat Molly, and her kittens, live here in feline paradise, while owner Debbie serves the locals home-made goodies. But even in the most idyllic surroundings, things don't always go to plan . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Debbie's heartbroken sister Linda arrives at the cafe, Debbie insists she move in. But Linda is not alone, and the cats are devastated with the arrival of Linda's dog, Beau. Sadly, Beau's arrival is not the only bombshell - now Molly's home is also under threat when a rival cat moves in on her turf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Christmas approaching, Molly is unsettled, barely roused by the promise of tinsel to play with. Fearing for her feline family she hopelessly stares out of the cafe window searching for an answer. Only a Christmas miracle could bring everyone together . . .&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"</description>

  <description>Nima Sherpa lives in Nepal at the top of the world, where the tallest mountain on earth, Chomolongma--the mountain we call Everest--towers above the clouds. Nima has promised her father, a mountain guide, that she will find a way to help make the world a better place. Every day, on the long walk to the market village where she goes to school, Nima meets porters and caravans carrying their goods to market, travelers trekking to their next lodge, and monks on their way to their monastery. After school, she meets her friend Tenzing, an old Tibetan trader, who shares some honey with her at the market place. Whenever Nima sees someone, she brings her hands together with her fingers almost touching her chin, bows her head slightly, and says "Namaste"--the light in me meets the light in you. Her mother tells her, "When you say 'Namaste, ' try to see the special spark of light that shines within every person's heart." In Namaste! Nima learns that she brightens the day for friends and strangers alike when she shares her sweetness and light, every time she says "Namaste." Woven into this simple, gentle story about recognizing and honoring the sacred in one another are delightful details of daily life in Nepal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An upROARiously funny take on following your wildest dreams, from the bestselling creator of &lt;i&gt;Dinosaur Comics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a regular old human is kind of a drag. That's why Sal is not going to be a teacher or doctor or lawyer when she grows up. She is going to grow up to be an awesome Tyrannosaurus Rex. Her brother thinks it's &lt;i&gt;impossible&lt;/i&gt;, but Sal sure shows him! And in the beginning, being a T. Rex &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; AWESOME. But did you know that it's kind of hard to make friends when you are a super-giant, super-loud, super-stompy dinosaur? If only there were a way for Sal to be 100% awesome, 100% of the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eisner Award-winning writer Ryan North makes his picture book debut with this bright, bold, and quirky story about finding--and taming--the beast within.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Mississippi ghost town and an art mystery combine in this gorgeously written debut just right for fans of Three Times Lucky and A Snicker of Magic!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far would you go to find something that might not even exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All her life, Cricket's mama has told her stories about a secret room painted by a mysterious artist. Now Mama's run off, and Cricket thinks the room might be the answer to getting her to come back. If it exists. And if she can find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cricket's only clue is a coin from a grown-over ghost town in the woods. So with her daddy's old guidebook and a coat full of snacks stolen from the Cash 'n' Carry, Cricket runs away to find the room. Surviving in the woods isn't easy. While Cricket camps out in an old tree house and looks for clues, she meets the last resident of the ghost town, encounters a poetry-loving dog (who just might hold a key to part of the puzzle), and discovers that sometimes you have to get a little lost . . . to really find your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A tale of adventure, full of mystery." --Robert Beatty, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Serafina and the Black Cloak</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;First dates can be murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting and compulsive, national bestselling author Wendy Walker’s &lt;i&gt;The Night Before&lt;/i&gt; “takes you to deep, dark places few thrillers dare to go” as two sisters uncover long-buried secrets when an internet date spirals out of control. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Lochner has never been lucky in love. She falls too hard and too fast, always choosing the wrong men. Devastated by the end of her last relationship, she fled her Wall Street job and New York City apartment for her sister’s home in the Connecticut suburb where they both grew up. Though still haunted by the tragedy that’s defined her entire life, Laura is determined to take one more chance on love with a man she’s met on an Internet dating site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie Ferro has spent most of her life worrying about her troubled sister. Fearless but fragile, Laura has always walked an emotional tightrope, and Rosie has always been there to catch her. Laura’s return, under mysterious circumstances, has cast a shadow over Rosie’s peaceful life with her husband and young son – a shadow that grows darker as Laura leaves the house for her blind date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Laura does not return home the following morning, Rosie fears the worst. She’s not responding to calls or texts, and she’s left no information about the man she planned to meet. As Rosie begins a desperate search to find her sister, she is not just worried about what this man might have done to Laura. She’s worried about what Laura may have done to him…</description>

  <description>One August morning while walking her dog, high-school English teacher Beatrice Ousterhout stumbles over the dead body of a student, Amber Inglin, who was to play the lead in Beatrice's production of John Webster's Jacobean tragedy, &lt;em&gt;The Duchess of Malfi&lt;/em&gt;. Barely able to speak, Beatrice calls the police. That is to say, she calls her daughter. Jes is a detective with two years of experience under her belt and a personal life composed primarily of a string of one-night-stands, including the owner of the field in which Beatrice has found Amber. In addition to a house and a field, Child Services lawyer Liam Walsh owns a vineyard, where Amber Inglin, along with a handful of other teens who've had difficulty negotiating the foster system, was an intern. Set among the hills and lakes of upstate New York and told in six vibrantly distinct voices, this complex and original narrative chronicles the rippling effects of a young girl's death through a densely intertwined community. By turns funny, fierce, lyrical and horrifying, &lt;i&gt;Birds of Wonder&lt;/i&gt; probes family ties, the stresses that break them, and the pasts that never really let us go.</description>

      <![CDATA[Excellent book!! Read it for my son and I’m so happy that he’s learning about Moses, slaves, and Egypt. Great history made simpler for kids, though longer picture book than most. My son &amp; I cry at the beginning where the mom had to say goodbye to Moses. ]]>

  <description>Beckett Gaines, a gay teen living in South Carolina, has his world turned upside-down by a jock in this laugh-out-loud novel that’s &lt;i&gt;Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;The Parent Trap&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beck:&lt;br /&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Golden Girls&lt;/i&gt;-loving, out-and-proud choir nerd growing up in the “ass-crack of the Bible belt.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jax:&lt;br /&gt; The Golden Boy, star quarterback with a slick veneer facing uncomfortable truths about himself and his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Beck’s emotionally fragile dad starts dating the recently single (and supposedly lesbian) mom of former bully, Jaxon Parker, Beck is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; having it. Jax isn’t happy about the situation either, holding out hope that his moms will reunite and restore the only stable home he’s ever known. Putting aside past differences, the boys plot to derail the budding romance between their parents at their conservative hometown’s first-ever Rainbow Prom. Hearts will be broken, new romance will bloom, but nothing will go down the way Beck and Jax have planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his hilarious and provocative debut, Greg Howard examines the challenges of growing up &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; in a small southern town through the lens of colorful and unforgettable characters who stay with you long after the last drop of sweet tea.</description>

  <description>Joel Higgins has 901 unsent text messages saved on his phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the thing that happened, there are certain people he hasn't been able to talk to in person. Sure, he shows up at school, does his mandatory volunteer hours at the soup kitchen, and spends pretty much every moment thinking about Eli, the most amazing girl in the world. But that doesn't mean he's keeping it together, or even that he has any friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of hanging out with people in real life, he drafts text messages. But he never presses send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As dismal as sophomore year was for Joel, he doesn't see how junior year will be any better. For starters, Eli doesn't know how he feels about her, his best friend Andy's gone, and he basically bombed the SATs. But as Joel spends more time at the soup kitchen with Eli and Benj, the new kid whose mouth seems to be unconnected to his brain, he forms bonds with the people they serve there-including a veteran they call Rooster-and begins to understand that the world is bigger than his own pain.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Lost Boy&lt;/i&gt; comes a historical fairy tale about a mermaid who leaves the sea for love and later finds herself in P.T. Barnum's American Museum as the real Fiji mermaid. However, leaving the museum may be harder than leaving the sea ever was.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once there was a mermaid who longed to know of more than her ocean home and her people. One day a fisherman trapped her in his net but couldn't bear to keep her. But his eyes were lonely and caught her more surely than the net, and so she evoked a magic that allowed her to walk upon the shore. The mermaid, Amelia, became his wife, and they lived on a cliff above the ocean for ever so many years, until one day the fisherman rowed out to sea and did not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. T. Barnum was looking for marvelous attractions for his American Museum, and he'd heard a rumor of a mermaid who lived on a cliff by the sea. He wanted to make his fortune, and an attraction like Amelia was just the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amelia agreed to play the mermaid for Barnum, and she believes she can leave any time she likes. But Barnum has never given up a money-making scheme in his life, and he's determined to hold on to his mermaid.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2 CHILDREN FOR SALE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrawled sign, peddling young siblings on a farmhouse porch, captures the desperation sweeping the country in 1931. It’s an era of breadlines, bank runs, and impossible choices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For struggling reporter Ellis Reed, the gut-wrenching scene evokes memories of his family’s dark past. He snaps a photograph of the children, not meant for publication. But when the image leads to his big break, the consequences are devastating in ways he never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by secrets of her own, secretary Lillian Palmer sees more in the picture than a good story and is soon drawn into the fray. Together, the two set out to right a wrongdoing and mend a fractured family, at the risk of everything they value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by an actual newspaper photo that stunned readers across the nation, this touching novel explores the tale within the frame and behind the lens—a journey of ambition, love, and the far-reaching effects of our actions.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A criminal mastermind's chilling terrorist plot forces FBI Special Agent Patrick Bowers to the brink in the latest thriller from bestselling novelist Steven James. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a senator's son takes his own life and posts the video live online, Agent Bowers is drawn into a complex web of lies that begins to threaten the people he loves the most. As he races to unravel the mystery behind the suicide and a centuries-old code that might help shed light on the case, he finds a dark pathway laced with twists and deadly secrets that touch a little too close to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fast-paced, intelligent thriller, Every Wicked Man will have readers racing through the pages to its thundering conclusion.</description>

  <description>Who's just the right size? You are! A sweet story about being tall or being small... and about hugging! For all readers ages 3 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that a frog is small enough to perch on a lily pad? A hippopotamus is not (obviously), but he is big enough to scare a crocodile away! And a kitten is small enough to fall asleep in the flowers, but an ostrich is not. An ostrich is big enough to shade her chicks with her wings. In 'Just theRight Size', Bonnie Grubman teaches children the basic concepts of big and small, and shows that no matter how small or how big, you’re always just the right size.</description>

  <description>Mr. Pack Rat is a particularly acquisitive small mammal with a hoarding problem (sound like someone you know?). Through trial and error, he begins to question whether having more things is really the secret to happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although real-life pack rats (genus Neotoma) build large piles of debris to nest in, Mr. Pack Rat isn’t satisfied with plain old sticks and leaves. He wants novelty and variety, and—unfortunately for him!—he owns a magical magnet that can summon anything he desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Pack Rat is always on to the next thing. Lovely flowers will brighten up his sticks and leaves…until they wilt. Colorful seashells won’t wilt, but they aren’t much fun. Games and toys are fun, but only if you have enough room to play with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wry, witty fable from Marcus Ewert, author of 10,000 Dresses, will have the whole family laughing, and, perhaps, learning along the way.</description>

  <description>Did you hear the story about Max, the boy who kidnapped his grandfather from a nursing home ? You didn't see it on the news? Well, let me tell you about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max lives in a small town, much smaller than yours. His grandpa is losing his memory, but still remembers quite a bit. You can imagine how they hurried, Max and his grandpa, followed by old Miss Schneider, who insisted on coming along. Why were they in a hurry? Because everyone was after them. Max had skipped school to rescue his grandpa, and they were just starting out on what promised to be one of the best days of their entire lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A touching story about dementia and the special relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, with full-color illustrations and a read-along CD audiobook featuring twelve classical pieces for children by Georges Bizet and Sergei Prokofiev.</description>

  <description>A remote lodge in upstate New York is the perfect getaway. . . until the bodies start piling up.It's winter in the Catskills and the weather outside is frightful. But Mitchell's Inn is so delightful! The cozy lodge nestled deep in the woods is perfect for a relaxing--maybe even romantic--weekend away. The Inn boasts spacious old rooms with huge wood-burning fireplaces, a well-stocked wine cellar, and opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or just curling up with a book and someone you love. So when the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in for the long haul. The power's down but they've got candles, blankets, and wood--a genuine rustic experience! Soon, though, a body turns up--surely an accident. When a second body appears, they start to panic. Then they find a third body. Within the snowed-in paradise, something--or someone--is picking off the guests one by one. They can't leave, and with no cell service, there's no prospect of getting the police in until the weather loosens its icy grip. The weekend getaway has turned deadly. For some couples, it's their first time away. For others, it will be their last. And there's nothing they can do about it but huddle down and hope they can survive the storm.</description>

  <description>In this moving picture book, award-winning collaborators Davide Cali and Serge Bloch present a fable for our time about two lonely soldiers facing each other across a barren battlefield. What each discovers, as the story unfolds, is that the enemy is not a faceless beast, but rather a real person with family, friends, and dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A 2015 Caldecott Honor Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In this magical picture book, a young boy spends an overnight visit with his nana and is frightened to find that the city where she lives is filled with noise and crowds and scary things. But then Nana makes him a special cape to help him be brave, and soon the everyday sights, sounds, and smells of the city are not scary—but wonderful. The succinct text is paired with watercolor illustrations that capture all the vitality, energy, and beauty of the city.</description>

  <description>Dexter T. Rexter is going to school. But will anyone like him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow is the biggest event ever in Dexter’s life: his best friend, Jack, is taking him to school for Show and Tell Day! Dexter has been getting ready for weeks. But now he’s a little nervous. What if the other kids don’t like him? So Dexter decides to come up with a plan. He’ll wear a costume. Dinosaurs in bunny ears look good, right? He’ll recite state capitals starting with…&lt;i&gt;uh&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;i&gt;ah&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt;. Then he realizes something. He can’t dance. He can’t recite things. He doesn’t have ANY skills. What’s a dino to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comical, interactive tale of belonging, friendship, anticipation, and first-day-at-school jitters lets readers experience the excitement and nervousness along with Dexter—and even offer him a little advice along the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In Heather Heyford’s newest book, a single mom and attorney with deep roots in the rolling hills of Oregon’s Ribbon Ridge wine country thinks her family is perfect as is—until she crosses paths again with a gruff police officer who has two boys of his own . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is nothing sweeter than the family you pick yourself . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After detective Alex Walker’s last case in Portland is skewered by a tough-as-nails attorney, he decides to finish out his career on a quiet note in the Willamette Valley. Dedicated to his job and committed to his family, he’s fine letting his brusque exterior keep even the thought of a relationship at bay—especially once he realizes his new hometown is the old hometown of the attorney who ruined his last case . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mom and attorney Kerry O’Hearn is just as wary as Alex is, thanks to her disastrous first marriage. But she isn’t fooled by Alex’s tough-guy image. When he asks for her assistance in gaining custody of two little boys from an abusive foster home, she sees what he desperately tries to hide: a giant-sized heart. Between them they have five kids and a whole barrel of bad experience. And yet, Kerry can’t shake the feeling that she and the crusty cop were meant to be . . .</description>

  <description>A historical novel of love and survival inspired by real resistance workers during World War II Austria, and the mysterious love letter that connects generations of Jewish families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Austria, 1938. &lt;/i&gt;Kristoff is a young apprentice to a master Jewish stamp engraver. When his teacher disappears during Kristallnacht, Kristoff is forced to engrave stamps for the Germans, and simultaneously works alongside Elena, his beloved teacher's fiery daughter, and with the Austrian resistance to send underground messages and forge papers. As he falls for Elena amidst the brutal chaos of war, Kristoff must find a way to save her, and himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles, 1989&lt;/i&gt;. Katie Nelson is going through a divorce and while cleaning out her house and life in the aftermath, she comes across the stamp collection of her father, who recently went into a nursing home. When an appraiser, Benjamin, discovers an unusual World War II-era Austrian stamp placed on an old love letter as he goes through her dad's collection, Katie and Benjamin are sent on a journey together that will uncover a story of passion and tragedy spanning decades and continents, behind the just fallen Berlin Wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A romantic, poignant and addictive novel, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Letter&lt;/i&gt; shows the lasting power of love.</description>

  <description>The most checked-out book in the Hogwarts Library, and a volume no Quidditch player or Harry Potter fan should be without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever asked yourself where the Golden Snitch came from, how the Bludgers came into existence, or why the Wigtown Wanderers have pictures of meat cleavers on their robes, you need QUIDDITCH THROUGH THE AGES. This invaluable volume is consulted by young Quidditch fans on an almost daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceeds from the sale of this book will go to Comic Relief, who will use your money to continue improving and changing lives -- work that is even more important and astonishing than the three-and-a-half-second capture of the Golden Snitch by Roderick Plumpton in 1921.</description>

      <![CDATA[DNF.. <br /><br />I'm not sure what I expect before reading this book, but I guess I didn't expect it to read like a boring history book. Though "Through the Ages" is a dead giveaway. I do like that there's humor. The book started out slow but got better at the Golden Snitch chapter. I like the illustrations...]]>

  <description>High school student Chloe Snow chronicles another year in her life while she navigates the highs and lows of family, friendship, school, and love in her diary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Chloe Snow’s sophomore year of high school, and life has only grown more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, Chloe was the star of the musical. This year, after an audition so disastrous she runs off the stage in tears, she’s cast as a lowly member of the ensemble. Will she be able to make it through the show knowing everyone’s either pitying her or reveling in her downfall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe’s best friend, Hannah, is no help: she’s been sucked into the orbit of Lex, the velvet-gloved, iron-fisted ruler of the sophomore class. Chloe’s dad is busy falling in love with Miss Murphy, and Chloe is no longer speaking to her mother, who is sending her increasingly desperate and unhinged emails from Mexico. As her parents’ divorce negotiations unravel, a custody battle looms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only Chloe could talk to Grady about it: his parents are divorced, and he’s easy to talk to. Or he was, until he declared his love for Chloe, and she turned him down because despite all her rational brain cells she can’t seem to get over Mac, and then Grady promptly started going out with Lex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the performance of the show approaches, Chloe must find a way to navigate all the messy elements of her life and make it through to the end of the year.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>Cottonwood Hollow, Kansas, is a strange place. For the past century, every girl has been born with a special talent, like the ability to Fix any object, Heal any wound, or Find what is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best friends Rome, Lux, and Mercy all have similar talents, but to them, their abilities often feel like a curse. Rome may be able to Fix anything she touches, but that won’t help her mom pay rent or make it any easier to confide in Lux and Mercy about what’s going on at home. And Rome isn’t the only one. Lux has been hiding bigger, more dangerous secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rome struggles to keep her friendships close, she discovers the truth about life in Cottonwood Hollow—that friends are stronger than curses, that trust is worth the risk, and sometimes, what you’ve been looking for has been under your feet the whole time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Something bad has happened to Alison Taylor.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her &lt;b&gt;Saturday night&lt;/b&gt; started normally. Recently separated from her husband, Ali has been persuaded by her friends to go on a date with a new man. She is ready, she is nervous, she is excited. She is about to take a step into her new future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By &lt;b&gt;Sunday morning&lt;/b&gt;, Ali’s life is unrecognisable. She wakes, and she knows that something is wrong. She is home, she is alone, she is hurt and she has no memory of what happened to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Worse still, when she looks in the mirror, &lt;b&gt;Ali doesn’t recognise the face staring back at her&lt;/b&gt;. She can’t recognise her friends and family. And she can’t recognise the person who is trying to destroy her… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Albert Einstein + James Patterson = A Must Read!&lt;br /&gt;The world's #1 bestselling author has teamed up with the world's most famous genius to entertain, educate and inspire a generation of kids – with the first and only kids' book series officially approved by the Albert Einstein Archives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old orphan Max Einstein (like Albert Einstein himself) is not your typical genius. Max hacks the computer system at NYU in order to attend college courses (even though she hates tests), builds homemade inventions to help the homeless, and plays speed chess in the park. Her not-so-normal life is crazy but predictable until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max is recruited by a mysterious organization! Their mission: solve some of the world's toughest problems using science. She's helped by a diverse group of young geniuses from around the globe as they invent new ways to power the farthest reaches of the planet. But that's only if the sinister outfit known only as The Corporation doesn't get to her first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Max Einstein is a heroine for the modern age and will be looked up to by readers for generations to come.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Avalon James and Atticus Brightwell have a secret--one that they aren't allowed to discuss with anyone. This secret is shared between two best friends. When you and your best friend turn ten years old magical things are said to happen. You both will receive some kind of magical power. It can be a power you can call on time and time again. Or it can be a power that comes once when you need it most. It's your Infinity Year and the possibilities are endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past year hasn't been great with her family being torn apart and bullying at school, so Avalon is depending on her magical ability to appear soon and help. With the clock ticking and her eleventh birthday approaching, which would be the end of her powers, Avalon's hopes are running high. Will she and Atticus get the powers they so desperately want and need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Middleton's debut novel is a wonderfully enchanting story of the possibility of magic and the even more magical bond between two best friends.</description>

  <description>Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if they can’t quite nail a first date . . . or a second first date . . . or a third?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work . . . and Ben doesn’t try hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if it is?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A life-affirming anthem to kindness and self-sacrifice, &lt;i&gt;The Travelling Cat Chronicles &lt;/i&gt;shows how the smallest things can provide the greatest joy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We take journeys to explore exotic new places and to return to the comforts of home, to visit old acquaintances and to make new friends. But the most important journey is the one that shows us how to follow our hearts . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An instant international bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Travelling Cat Chronicles&lt;/i&gt; has charmed readers around the world. With simple yet descriptive prose, this novel gives voice to Nana the cat and his owner, Satoru, as they take to the road on a journey with no other purpose than to visit three of Satoru's longtime friends. Or so Nana is led to believe . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his crooked tail--a sign of good fortune--and adventurous spirit, Nana is the perfect companion for the man who took him in as a stray. And as they travel in a silver van across Japan, with its ever-changing scenery and seasons, they will learn the true meaning of courage and gratitude, of loyalty and love.</description>

  <description>Echo Ridge is small-town America. Ellery's never been there, but she's heard all about it. Her aunt went missing there at age seventeen. And only five years ago, a homecoming queen put the town on the map when she was killed. Now Ellery has to move there to live with a grandmother she barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is picture-perfect, but it's hiding secrets. And before school even begins for Ellery, someone's declared open season on homecoming, promising to make it as dangerous as it was five years ago. Then, almost as if to prove it, another girl goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellery knows all about secrets. Her mother has them; her grandmother does too. And the longer she's in Echo Ridge, the clearer it becomes that everyone there is hiding something. The thing is, secrets are dangerous--and most people aren't good at keeping them. Which is why in Echo Ridge, it's safest to keep your secrets to yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twenty-five exceptional comic book creators join forces to share the heroic story of Gandhi in this inspiring graphic novel biography.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a young man in India, Gandhi saw firsthand how people were treated unfairly. Refusing to accept injustice, he came up with a brilliant way to fight back through quiet, peaceful protest. He used his methods in South Africa and India, where he led a nonviolent revolution that freed his country from British rule. Through his calm, steady heroism, Gandhi changed the lives of millions and inspired civil rights movements all over the world, proving that the smallest of us can be the most powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galvanized by Gandhi's example of gentle, peaceful activism, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Brad Meltzer asked his friends in the comic book world to help him make a difference by creating this philanthropic graphic novel. Twenty-four illustrators--including many of the most acclaimed artists in comics today--enthusiastically joined the project, agreeing to donate their work so that their royalties can go to Seeds of Peace, a non-profit organization that inspires and cultivates new generations of global leaders. This extraordinary biography is a glorious team effort that truly exemplifies Gandhi's selflessness and love for humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The illustrators included are: Art Adams, John Cassaday, Jim Cheung, Amanda Connor, Carlos D'Anda, Michael Gaydos, Gene Ha, Stephanie Hans, Bryan Hitch, Phil Jimenez, Siddharth Kotian, David LaFuente, David Mack, Alex Maleev, Francis Manapul, David Marquez, Steve McNiven, Rags Morales, Saumin Patel, Nate Powell, Stephane Roux, Marco Rudy, Kamome Shirahama, Bill Sienkiewicz, and Abhishek Singh.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's an election season gone wild in this "irresistible" (&lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/i&gt;) and "whip-smart" (&lt;i&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) novel about a delicious cast of characters who forge an unlikely friendship while their significant others are out on the campaign trail.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cady Davenport is living the American dream...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least she's supposed to be. She's in a new city, with a new job and even a new fiancé . But when her husband-to-be hits the road for the upcoming presidential election, Cady realizes she's on her own--and that her dream life might not be all she'd imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she finds herself thrust straight into the heart of the most influential inner circle in Washington, DC: the campaign widows. As friends, they're an unlikely group--a fabulous Georgetown doyenne, a speechwriter turned mommy blogger, an artsy website editor and a First Lady hopeful who's not convinced she wants the job. But they share one undeniable bond: their spouses are all out on the trail during a hotly contested election season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cady is unsure of her place in their illustrious group, but with the pressures of the unprecedented election mounting, the widows' worlds keep turning, faster than ever, as they hold down the fort while running companies, raising babies, racking up page views and even reinventing themselves. And their friendship might be just what Cady needs to find the strength to pursue her own happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the “compelling” (&lt;i&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/i&gt;, Minneapolis) and critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Everything You Want Me to Be&lt;/i&gt;, a riveting and suspenseful thriller about the mysterious disappearance of a boy and his stunning return ten years later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a place in Minnesota with hundreds of miles of glacial lakes and untouched forests called the Boundary Waters. Ten years ago a man and his son trekked into this wilderness and never returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search teams found their campsite ravaged by what looked like a bear. They were presumed dead until a decade later...the son appeared. Discovered while ransacking an outfitter store, he was violent and uncommunicative and sent to a psychiatric facility. Maya Stark, the assistant language therapist, is charged with making a connection with their high-profile patient. No matter how she tries, however, he refuses to answer questions about his father or the last ten years of his life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Maya, who was abandoned by her own mother, has secrets, too. And as she’s drawn closer to this enigmatic boy who is no longer a boy, she’ll risk everything to reunite him with his father who has disappeared from the known world.</description>

  <description>Brynn Haper's life has one steadying force--Rachel Maddow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She watches her daily, and after writing to Rachel for a school project--and actually getting a response--Brynn starts drafting e-mails to Rachel but never sending them. Brynn tells Rachel about breaking up with her first serious girlfriend, about her brother Nick's death, about her passive mother and even worse stepfather, about how she's stuck in remedial courses at school and is considering dropping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Brynn is confronted with a moral dilemma. One student representative will be allowed to have a voice among the administration in the selection of a new school superintendent. Brynn's archnemesis, Adam, and ex-girlfriend, Sarah, believe only Honors students are worthy of the selection committee seat. Brynn feels all students deserve a voice. When she runs for the position, the knives are out. So she begins to ask herself: What Would Rachel Maddow Do?</description>

      <![CDATA[I started reading Dear Rachel Maddow on 2/7/2019 and finished it on 2/11/2019 at 12:45AM. This book is an excellent read! I enjoyed the romance in this book. It’s fun to follow how Brynn pines over her ex Sarah and then being such a klutz when around the new girl she likes. Girl love is such a cu...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Bold, graphic art by indie rocker Chris Gorman of Belly captures the thrill and challenges of marching to your own beat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet a pogo-dancing, punk-rock-loving kid who loves to express himself in his own unique way. His clothes, hairstyle, music, and just the way he hears the world, all set him apart. Not everyone understands him, but he likes being one of a kind--even though it's lonely sometimes. Fortunately, it's a wide world out there, and if he looks around a kid is sure to find other one-of-a-kinds with common interests.</description>

  <description>4 Hours and 21 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mayim Bialik, star of&lt;i&gt; The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt; and author of the #1 bestseller &lt;i&gt;Girling Up, &lt;/i&gt; puts her Ph.D. to work to talk to teen boys about the science and pressures of growing up male in today's world. A must-have book for all teenage boys!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does my voice crack like that? What should I eat to build muscle? How do I talk to someone I have a crush on? What do I do if someone calls me names or bullies me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing from a boy to a man is no easy task. Bodies are changing, social circles are evolving, hair is appearing in places it never was before -- and on top of it all, there's the ever-present pressure to conform to the typical idea of what it means to be "manly" and masculine. But it's easier to do if you're armed with facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using personal anecdotes as an overly observant mother of two boys and plenty of scientific information from her life as a neuroscientist, Mayim Bialik, PhD, star of &lt;i&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt;, talks directly to teen boys about what it means to grow from a boy to a man biologically, psychologically, and sociologically. Using the same cool, fun, and friendly tone that she took in &lt;i&gt;Girling Up&lt;/i&gt;, Mayim takes boys--and their parents!--through the challenges and triumphs of Boying Up today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In six sections (How Boys Bodies Work; How Boys Grow; How Boys Learn; How Boys Cope; How Boys Love; and How Boys Make a Difference), she takes a look at what it means for boys to come of age in today's world, how can they take control of their paths, and what can they do to help shape the types of futures they want for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Boying Up&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A matter-of-fact mirror that reflects reality and respect, not bewildered embarrassment." --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Boying Up hits all the hot spots and should be included in tween and teen library collections." --&lt;i&gt;VOYA&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Plum wants a pet. Plum's dad wants NO pets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Plum never takes no for an answer. So she gets the only pet she can: a pet dad. He loves playtime, tummy rubs, and scratches behind the ears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he won't sit or fetch or chase. How will Plum train her perfect pet? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilariously relatable and with ultra-cute art, &lt;i&gt;Pet Dad&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for kids who love or want pets--or who already have the perfect parents to make up for it.</description>

  <description>Mariana the Mermaid is not like the other mermaids. Abandoned by a careless mother on the ocean floor, she has never laughed or played, and can barely even swim. She feels useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Muriel the Turtle, who welcomes her into her family and teaches her to sing her own mighty song, making her feel confident and ready to join in with the other mermaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written for children aged 4+, this picture book uses a simple metaphor to show how children who have experienced neglect or who lack confidence can learn to find a sense of self-worth. It will help children explore their feelings and encourage communication.</description>

  <description>'When I am ready, I need you to talk to me and help me understand my feelings...'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reassuring story helps children aged 5+ with attachment issues to understand their feelings, open up to a caring adult and learn how to choose positive behaviours. Ben is made up of lots of different 'parts' - to name a few, he has happy, caring, angry, excited, hugging and yelling parts. Ben explains how all these parts are okay, and that a caring adult can help you to understand and manage them more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book also features activities to help children talk about their feelings, and a simple introduction to attachment theory for adults.</description>

  <description>In a star system dominated by the brutal Vathek empire, eighteen-year-old Amani is a dreamer. She dreams of what life was like before the occupation; she dreams of writing poetry like the old-world poems she adores; she dreams of receiving a sign from Dihya that one day, she, too, will have adventure, and travel beyond her isolated moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when adventure comes for Amani, it is not what she expects: she is kidnapped by the regime and taken in secret to the royal palace, where she discovers that she is nearly identical to the cruel half-Vathek Princess Maram. The princess is so hated by her conquered people that she requires a body double, someone to appear in public as Maram, ready to die in her place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Amani is forced into her new role, she can’t help but enjoy the palace’s beauty—and her time with the princess’ fiancé, Idris. But the glitter of the royal court belies a world of violence and fear. If Amani ever wishes to see her family again, she must play the princess to perfection...because one wrong move could lead to her death.</description>

In Japanese, when you're lazy, you are referred to as gude gude. And that's where our new friend gets its name. Gudetama (tama from "tamago," egg in Japanese) is the lazy egg. Gudetama likes soy sauce and being left alone. Sometimes, Gudetama wonders if we are born only to suffer. And here, in Eggsistential Thoughts, are Gudetama's musings on life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A perfectly pitched bedtime story and counting book for sleepy train lovers, illustrated in dramatic 3D sculptures!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little boy climbs into bed with a book and starts counting the train cars in it, between the engine and caboose. "Ten sleepy cars going clickety-clack," reads the refrain. But as the boy counts cars and gets sleepier and sleepier, his room looks more and more like one of the train cars from his book--the sleeping car, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhythmically told by the author of the Froggy books, &lt;i&gt;Sleep Train&lt;/i&gt; is also stunning to look at. 3D illustrator, Lauren Eldridge, has sculpted an entire train full of intricate details. Part bedtime story, part counting book, part children's fantasy, &lt;i&gt;Sleep Train&lt;/i&gt; is a magical ride to dreamland.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the creator of &lt;i&gt;Splat!&lt;/i&gt; comes more playful, irreverent, kid-empowering fun--with a rhyming twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this buoyant rhyming romp, words have gone mysteriously missing: Who stole Marlow's happy smile, and replaced it with a crocodile? Who swiped Dingle's sneeze--aaaaachooo!--and left a stinky cheese? The thief took Tumble's orange, and switched it with a . . . with a . . . Hey, does anything rhyme with orange? No? Aha! Could this be the rhyming robber's undoing? Guided by bright, clever artwork, kids are empowered to put the final clues together for themselves to solve this silly rhyme crime, then guess at the name-nabber's next sneaky move. Splendid, satisfying, inspiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Rhyming wordplay. . . [and] even more hysterical laughter." &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The creator of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Splat! &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A status-obsessed senior unexpectedly falls for a freshman because of his Danny Zuko audition in their high school's production of &lt;i&gt;Grease&lt;/i&gt; in this epistolary novel set in 1991.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1991, and Tara Maureen Murphy is finally on top. A frightening cross between Regina George and Tracy Flick, Tara Maureen Murphy is any high school's worst nightmare, bringing single-minded ambition, narcissism, manipulation, and jealousy to new extremes. She's got a hot jock boyfriend in Christopher Patrick Caparelli, her best friend Stef Campbell by her side, and she's a SENIOR, poised to star as Sandy in South High's production of &lt;i&gt;Grease&lt;/i&gt;. Cinching the role is just one teensy step in Tara's plot to get out of her hometown and become the Broadway starlet she was born to be. She's grasping distance from the finish line--graduation and college are right around the corner--but she has to remain vigilant. It gets trickier with the arrival of freshman Matthew Bloom, whose dazzling audition for the role of Danny Zuko turns Tara's world upside down. Freshmen belong in the chorus, not the spotlight! But Tara's outrage is tinged with an unfamiliar emotion, at least to her: adoration. And what starts as a conniving ploy to "mentor" young Matt quickly turns into a romantic obsession that threatens to topple Tara's hard-won status at South High....</description>

  <description>Emma Gatewood’s life was far from easy. In rural Ohio, she managed a household of 11 kids alongside a less-than-supportive husband. One day, at age 67, she decided to go for a nice long walk . . . and ended up completing the Appalachian Trail.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With just the clothes on her back and a pair of thin canvas sneakers on her feet, Grandma Gatewood hiked up ridges and down ravines. She braved angry storms and witnessed breathtaking sunrises. When things got particularly tough, she relied on the kindness of strangers or sheer luck to get her through the night. When the newspapers got wind of her amazing adventure, the whole country cheered her on to the end of her trek, which came just a few months after she set out. A story of true grit and girl power at any age, &lt;i&gt;Grandma Gatewood&lt;/i&gt; proves that no peak is insurmountable.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Malin’s mission to avenge her mother's murder has uncovered dangerous secrets. As a Valkyrie-in-training, Malin must slay immortals who’ve had their time, to maintain balance between humans and immortals. But her quest could destroy earth’s stability – and unleash chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when she needs to focus, her friend Asher is in grave danger. He’s been dragged into the underworld, where vengeful immortals plot revolution. Malin believes her feelings mustn’t distract from her goal – but is desperate to rescue him. So she ventures into the darkest of realms, knowing she may not survive. With new allies at her side and new enemies ahead, Malin will face terrible choices. She’ll have to keep her head – or be ruled by her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Be careful who you let in . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Caroline and Francis receive an offer to house swap--from their city flat to a townhouse in a leafy, upscale London suburb--they jump at the chance for a week away from home, their son, and the tensions that have pushed their marriage to the brink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the couple settles in, the old problems that permeate their marriage--his unhealthy behaviors, her indiscretions--start bubbling to the surface. But while they attempt to mend their relationship, their neighbor, an intense young woman, is showing a little too much interest in their activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Caroline slowly begins to uncover some signs of life in the stark house--signs of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; life. The flowers in the bathroom or the music might seem innocent to anyone else--but to her they are clues. It seems the person they have swapped with is someone who knows her, someone who knows the secrets she's desperate to forget...</description>

  <description>*** YA Winner National Indie Excellence Awards ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millington Valley is a quintessential small Pennsylvania town: families go back generations. Football rules. Kids drink while adults look the other way. High school is a whirlwind of aspiration and rivalry, friendship and jealousy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When smart and pretty Molly Hanover moves to town and attracts the attention of the football team’s hero, Wade Thornton—a nice guy with a bad drinking habit—longtime friendships are threatened and a popular cheerleader tries to turn the school against Molly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young couple’s future is shattered when Wade, drunk, wrecks his truck and Molly is thrown through the windshield. She wakes from a coma to find her beauty marred and her memory full of holes. As she struggles to heal, she becomes sure that something terrible happened before the accident. And there is somebody in the valley who doesn’t want her to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prologue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Hanover lifted her chin and the pain was so sharp her head slammed down onto the muddy gravel. Her teeth gashed her tongue and the copper taste of blood filled her mouth. She closed her eyes and the thump of her heartbeat pounded in her ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn’t happening. She had to get up and find him. She needed to tell him something—something important—and her mother, she had decided she would tell her mother, too. They would help her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the edge of the field where she had fallen, a few un-harvested corn stalks jutted skyward. Late autumn grass sprouted in the weedy undergrowth. She lay splayed facedown, her arm twisted behind her back, raw pain searing through her right shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where was he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, she tried to raise her head and tiny spurts of light exploded against the darkness. Chilly rain stung her cheek and blurred her vision. Her hair stuck to her neck matted with bits of glass, dirt, and blood. The ground smelled fresh and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help, she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to concentrate, but she listened carefully and heard the soft ping of rain hitting her nylon jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay awake, she warned herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She rolled and saw the wet road sparkle in a vehicle’s headlights. Maybe it was a bad dream. But the pain, the pain was real. Hot blood burned through the cut in her cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mind raced and the sharp edge of panic pierced her memory. There was a secret, a thing unspeakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever she wanted to tell them had vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her world went black.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ladybug Girl and her friends help at a dog-adoption fair and discover that even the littlest things can make a big difference in this tenth hardcover in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Ladybug Girl series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lulu is excited to meet all the rescue dogs when the pet-adoption fair comes to her local farmers' market. She wants to take all of them home--but she already has Bingo, and Mama says one dog is enough for their family. That doesn't mean Lulu can't help, though. It's time for Ladybug Girl and the Bug Squad--her friends Grasshopper Girl and Bumblebee Boy--to step in! The Bug Squad can do all kinds of little but important things, like brush the dogs, play with them, and bring them water and food. And then Lulu comes up with the perfect plan to help the dogs find their forever homes. Her idea is such a success that the Bug Squad knows they'll be back again next week. Together, they can help every dog get adopted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beloved series is celebrated for its gentle, authentic, and imaginative exploration of kid-emotions and -truths.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A magical story about a boy's love for his dying father and his journey to the mythic Train of Lost Things, where beloved lost objects are rescued and protected until they can be returned. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth, The Bridge to Terabithia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Lost in the Sun&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty cherishes the extra-special birthday present his dad gave him -- a jean jacket on which he's afixed numerous buttons -- because it's a tie to his father, who is sick and doesn't have much time left. So when his jacket goes missing, Marty is devastated. When his dad tells him the story of the Train of Lost Things, a magical train that flies through the air collecting objects lost by kids, Marty is sure that the train must be real, and that if he can just find the train and get his jacket back, he can make his dad better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the train &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; real -- and it's gone out of control! Instead of just collecting things that have been accidentally lost, the train has been stealing things. Along with Dina and Star, the girls he meets aboard the train, Marty needs to figure out what's going on and help set it right. As he searches for his jacket, and for a way to fix the train, Marty begins to wonder whether he's looking for the right things after all. And he realizes that sometimes you need to escape reality in order to let it sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this achingly beautiful adventure, it is the power of memories, and the love between a father and son, that ultimately save the day.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Few words are needed in this inventive and fun transportation adventure!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bus! Stop!" a boy yells, as his bus pulls away one early morning. He must wait for the next bus. But the next one does NOT look like his bus at all. And neither does the next one, or the next. At first, the boy is annoyed. Then he is puzzled. Then intrigued. The other buses look much more interesting than his bus. Maybe he should try a different bus after all, and he's glad he does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a book with few words and delightful illustrations that shows very young children that trying something a little different can be a lot of fun.</description>

  <description>James Patterson presents this emotionally resonant novel that shows that while some broken things can't be put back exactly the way they were, they can be repaired and made even stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kira's Twelve Steps To A Normal Life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Accept Grams is gone.&lt;br /&gt;2. Learn to forgive Dad.&lt;br /&gt;3. Steal back ex-boyfriend from best friend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between 1 and 12, realize that when your parent's an alcoholic, there's no such thing as "normal."&lt;br /&gt;When Kira's father enters rehab, she's forced to leave everything behind--her home, her best friends, her boyfriend...everything she loves. Now her father's sober (again) and Kira is returning home, determined to get her life back to normal...exactly as it was before she was sent away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is that what Kira really wants?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This sweet companion to David Ezra Stein's award-winning &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leaves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; celebrates the joy of savoring something you love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear is ravenous when he wakes up from his winter sleep and has one thing on his mind: honey! Alas, it is too soon for honey, so Bear tries hard to be patient. The world around him is waking up, too, and he soon remembers all the other things he loves, like warm grass, berries, and rain. He's almost content, until, one day, he hears a welcome buzzing sound . . . and finally it is time for Bear to delight in the thing he relishes above all others--and it is as warm, golden, sweet, and good as he remembered.</description>

Not the kitchen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hercules is only trying to be helpful but he’s just hopeless. It’s time to send this dim demigod home before Tim becomes ancient history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Friendship, sharing, generosity. These morals are all about to be tested as Rexy meets his neighbor Trixie. &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rexy is a dinosaur who’s very friendly and easily gets excited. His excitement reached an all-time high after his parents bought him a new gift – a shiny red bicycle. Eager to try it out, Rexy put on his helmet and rode around his yard enjoying himself to the fullest. While riding, Rexy encountered his neighbor Trixie. Rexy’s shiny bike immediately caught Trixie’s attention and wanted to ride it for herself. Overly protective with his brand new bike, Rexy refused. He didn’t want to share! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Find out exactly how Trixie handled Rexy’s attitude and what influenced him to open up to his neighbor. Did Rexy realize his selfishness shortly after? Did his parents have anything to do with it? What surprise awaited Rexy for showing that sharing is caring? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rexy the Dinosaur and a New Bike&lt;/i&gt; is a terrific story that highlights the value of sharing. Tell it in front of a class or read it as a nice bedtime story to your children. Witness Rexy, his bicycle, and his lush yard in detailed, hand-drawn watercolor illustrations by notable picture books artist Nadin Solntseva. The story and dialogue are written for kids ages 3-5 in mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Add Rexy’s story to your dinosaur books collection right now for access to Rexy’s coloring book. This completely FREE coloring book comes with 5 full-sized printable pages featuring Rexy, Trixie, and the shiny red bicycle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sharing is a very important trait to have and is best to teach them while they are young. You are sure to win friends like Rexy did and more. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.</description>

  <description>Nancy is a beautiful dragonfly. In fact, her friends say that she is the most beautiful dragonfly ever! Her friends are Freddy Tree Frog and Little Blue Baron. Together, they are best friends, and they always have fun. Nancy thought her life would be perfect forever, until one day ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While diving to catch a mosquito, Nancy doesn't notice Blackie the Widow Spider's web. Her wing gets caught, and in a panic, Nancy pulls herself loose. A piece of her beautiful wing is left behind, so she flies away and hides. She doesn't think her friends will like her, so she remains hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She expects her friends to laugh, but her best friends make her realize something important. They don't love Nancy because she's beautiful on the outside but because of a different reason altogether!</description>

When a foreign airliner is forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airport, the Iranians quickly become suspicious. American businessman Jake Keller is separated from the other passengers and secretly arrested on charges of espionage. Alone and against overwhelming odds, he soon finds himself battling for his life as he attempts to fight his way to freedom and return home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The electrifying conclusion to the &lt;i&gt;Dividing Eden&lt;/i&gt; series by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Testing&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, Joelle Charbonneau.&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trials of Virtuous Succession have ended. Prince Andreus is king—and Princess Carys is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as he’s haunted by what he did to win the throne, Andreus discovers that his dream of ruling only brings new problems. The people love his twin even more in death than they did when she was alive. The Elders treat him as a figurehead. And worst of all, the winds of Eden are faltering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite what everyone believes, Carys is alive. Exiled to the wilderness, Carys struggles to control the powers that have broken free inside her. And as she grows stronger, so does her conviction that she must return to the Palace of Winds, face her twin and root out the treachery that began long before the first Trials started. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kingdom of Eden is growing darker with each passing day. Brother and sister, former foes, must decide whether some betrayals cut too deep to be forgiven—and whether one will wear the crown or both will lose everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harriet Tubman's heroic and pivotal role in the fight against slavery is the subject of the fourteenth picture book in this &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling biography series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves. Each book tells the story of one of America's icons in a lively, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers and that always includes the hero's childhood influences. At the back are an excellent timeline and photos. This volume focuses on Harriet Tubman's brave heroism as part of the movement to abolish slavery. As one of the key players in the Underground Railroad, she helped enslaved African Americans escape and find freedom.</description>

  <description>Le Grand’s Carnival Fantastic isn’t like other traveling circuses. It’s bound by a charm, held together by a centuries-old curse, that protects its members from ever growing older or getting hurt. Emmaline King is drawn to the circus like a moth to a flame…and unwittingly recruited into its folds by a mysterious teen boy whose kiss is as cold as ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to travel through Texas as the new Girl in the Box, Emmaline is completely trapped. Breaking the curse seems like her only chance at freedom, but with no curse, there’s no charm, either—dooming everyone who calls the Carnival Fantastic home. Including the boy she’s afraid she’s falling for. 	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything—including his life—could end with just one kiss.</description>

  <description>Gabe and Elyse have never met. But they both have something to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, shy Elyse can't believe it when she's cast as the lead in her Portland high school's production of Romeo and Juliet. Her best friend, Brynn, is usually the star, and Elyse isn't sure she's up to the task. But when someone at rehearsals starts to catch her eye--someone she knows she absolutely shouldn't be with--she can't help but be pulled into the spotlight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin native Gabe is contemplating the unthinkable--breaking up with Sasha, his headstrong, popular girlfriend. She's not going to let him slip through her fingers, though, and when rumors start to circulate around school, he knows she has the power to change his life forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe and Elyse both make the mistake of falling for the wrong person, and falling hard. Told in parallel narratives, this twisty, shocking story shows how one bad choice can lead to a spiral of unforeseen consequences that not everyone will survive.</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>Meet Hanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He’s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she’ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Suzette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna’s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette's husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there’s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn’t the best place for their baby girl after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One fugitive. A deadly plot. No rules. Thus begins an ingenious and lightning-fast thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Sergeant Matthew Ryan wants to clear the name of his former boss, who stands accused of official corruption. But before he can do so, his boss disappears. Did he escape from police custody, or was he kidnapped? Or did something even worse happen to him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Silent Room&lt;/i&gt; has everything a good thriller should have—compelling characters, a gripping plot and storyline, superb pacing, and a strong sense of place. In addition it has heart, something many thrillers sorely lack. Add some truly scary villains, vast uncertainty about whom to trust, and a loudly ticking clock, and we have ourselves a thriller that will grip readers from the first pages and never let go.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;His scandal. Her secret&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Angela met Jason Powell while catering a dinner party in East Hampton, she assumed their romance would be a short-lived fling, like so many relationships between locals and summer visitors. To her surprise, Jason, a brilliant economics professor at NYU, had other plans, and they married the following summer. For Angela, the marriage turned out to be a chance to reboot her life. She and her son were finally able to move out of her mother’s home to Manhattan, where no one knew about her tragic past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, thanks to a bestselling book and a growing media career, Jason has become a cultural lightning rod, placing Angela near the spotlight she worked so carefully to avoid. When a college intern makes an accusation against Jason, and another woman, Kerry Lynch, comes forward with an even more troubling allegation, their perfect life begins to unravel. Jason insists he is innocent, and Angela believes him. But when Kerry disappears, Angela is forced to take a closer look at the man she married. And when she is asked to defend Jason in court, she realizes that her loyalty to her husband could unearth old secrets.</description>

  <description>Mr. Tweed is back with a brand new adventure, and he needs your help once more! He’s come to the zoo to see his favorite ten-piece band perform, but they can’t find each other—can you spot them amongst all the other animals?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautifully illustrated search-and-find book from the wacky imagination of Jim Stoten. Children are encouraged to participate in the hunt for the missing band members, who are cleverly hidden within Stoten’s wonderfully whimsical and brightly colored drawings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jim Stoten&lt;/b&gt; is an illustrator based in London, UK. He frequently exhibits his work in galleries around the globe.</description>

  <description>This is the story of three best friends: one who was murdered, one who went to prison, and one who's been searching for the truth all these years . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she was sixteen years old, Angela Wong—one of the most popular girls in school—disappeared without a trace. Nobody ever suspected that her best friend, Georgina Shaw, now an executive and rising star at her Seattle pharmaceutical company, was involved in any way. Certainly not Kaiser Brody, who was close with both girls back in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fourteen years later, Angela Wong's remains are discovered in the woods near Geo's childhood home. And Kaiser—now a detective with Seattle PD—finally learns the truth: Angela was a victim of Calvin James. The same Calvin James who murdered at least three other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the authorities, Calvin is a serial killer. But to Geo, he's something else entirely. Back in high school, Calvin was Geo's first love. Turbulent and often volatile, their relationship bordered on obsession from the moment they met right up until the night Angela was killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fourteen years, Geo knew what happened to Angela and told no one. For fourteen years, she carried the secret of Angela's death until Geo was arrested and sent to prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While everyone thinks they finally know the truth, there are dark secrets buried deep. And what happened that fateful night is more complex and more chilling than anyone really knows. Now the obsessive past catches up with the deadly present when new bodies begin to turn up, killed in the exact same manner as Angela Wong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far will someone go to bury her secrets and hide her grief? How long can you get away with a lie? How long can you live with it?</description>

  <description>When debut novelist Eliza Fontaine is found at the bottom of a hotel pool, her family at first assumes that it’s just another failed suicide attempt. But Eliza swears she was pushed, and her rescuer is the only witness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find out who attacked her, Eliza takes it upon herself to investigate. But as the publication date for her novel draws closer, Eliza finds more questions than answers. Like why are her editor, agent, and family mixing up events from her novel with events from her life? Her novel is completely fictional, isn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeper Eliza goes into her investigation while struggling with memory loss, the closer her life starts to resemble her novel until the line between reality and fiction starts to blur and she can no longer tell where her protagonist’s life ends and hers begins.</description>

  <description>Defense lawyer Andy Carpenter usually tries to avoid taking on new cases at all costs. But this time, he’s happy—eager, even—to take the case that’s just come his way. Andy’s long-time friend Martha “Pups” Boyer takes in stray puppies that the local dog rescue center can’t handle, raises them until they’re old enough to adopt, and then finds good homes for them. Not everyone admires the work Pups does as much as Andy does, however. With Christmas just around the corner, one of Pups’s neighbors has just reported Pups to the city for having more than the legal number of pets in her home under the local zoning laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy happily takes Pups’s case, and he feels confident in a positive outcome. Who could punish someone for rescuing puppies, after all, especially at Christmastime? But things get a lot more complicated when Randy Hennessey, the neighbor who registered the complaint against Pups, turns up dead. Pups had loudly and publicly threatened Hennessey after he filed his complaint, and Pups was also the one to find his body. All the evidence seems to point to Pups as the killer, and suddenly Andy has a murder case on his hands. He doesn’t believe Pups could be guilty, but as he starts digging deeper into the truth behind Hennessey’s murder, Andy may find himself facing a killer more dangerous than he ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his trademark wit, larger-than-life characters, and clever plotting, David Rosenfelt delivers another gripping mystery.</description>

  <description>Ellery Hathaway knows a thing or two about serial killers, but not through her police training. She's an officer in sleepy Woodbury, MA, where a bicycle theft still makes the newspapers. No one there knows she was once victim number seventeen in the grisly story of serial killer Francis Michael Coben. The only victim who lived. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When three people disappear from her town in three years, all around her birthday—the day she was kidnapped so long ago—Ellery fears someone knows her secret. Someone very dangerous. Her superiors dismiss her concerns, but Ellery knows the vanishing season is coming and anyone could be next. She contacts the one man she knows will believe her: the FBI agent who saved her from a killer’s closet all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agent Reed Markham made his name and fame on the back of the Coben case, but his fortunes have since turned. His marriage is in shambles, his bosses think he's washed up, and worst of all, he blew a major investigation. When Ellery calls him, he can’t help but wonder: sure, he rescued her, but was she ever truly saved? His greatest triumph is Ellery’s waking nightmare, and now both of them are about to be sucked into the past, back to the case that made them...with a killer who can't let go.</description>

  <description>When two young sisters disappear from a strip mall parking lot in a small Pennsylvania town, their devastated mother hires an enigmatic bounty hunter, Alice Vega, to help find the girls. Immediately shut out by a local police department already stretched thin by budget cuts and the growing OxyContin and meth epidemic, Vega enlists the help of a disgraced former cop, Max Caplan. Cap is a man trying to put the scandal of his past behind him and move on, but Vega needs his help to find the girls, and she will not be denied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With little to go on, Vega and Cap will go to extraordinary lengths to untangle a dangerous web of lies, false leads, and complex relationships to find the girls before time runs out, and they are gone forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Between the Blade and the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a brilliant new young adult fantasy duology inspired by Norse mythology by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Amanda Hocking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of Odin's Valkyries, Malin's greatest responsibility is to slay immortals and return them to the underworld. The balance of the world rests on her ability to carry out orders. But when Malin discovers that her mother spared the life of an immortal who was destined to die, her world is thrown into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Malin wrestles with the knowledge that her mother might not be who she thought, she’s also thrust into the path of a gorgeous blue-eyed guy named Asher who needs her help slaying the rogue immortal who destroyed his family. Malin, along with her best friend and her ex-girlfriend, must decide where her loyalties lie...and whether helping Asher enact his revenge is worth the risk—to the world and to her heart.</description>

  <description>Four suburban mothers and friends conspire to cover up a deadly crime in this heart-stopping novel of suspense in the tradition of Lisa Scottoline and Lisa Unger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alison, Julie, Sarah, Heather. Four friends living the suburban ideal. Their jobs are steady, their kids are healthy. They’re as beautiful as their houses. But each of them has a dirty little secret, and hidden behind the veneer of their perfect lives is a crime and a mystery that will consume them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything starts to unravel when Alison spots a nasty bruise on Heather’s wrist. She shares her suspicions with Julie and Sarah, compelling all three to investigate what looks like an increasingly violent marriage. As mysterious injuries and erratic behavior mount, Heather can no longer deny the abuse, but she refuses to leave her husband. Desperate to save her, Alison and the others dread the phone call telling them that she’s been killed. But when that call finally comes, it’s not Heather who’s dead. In a moment they’ll come to regret, the women must decide what lengths they’ll go to in order to help a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Between Us is a thrilling glimpse into the underbelly of suburbia, where not all neighbors can be trusted, and even the closest friends keep dangerous secrets. You never really know what goes on in another person’s mind, or in their marriage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this genre-bending novel, there is no such thing as chance and every action is carefully executed by highly trained agents. You’ll never looks at coincidences the same way again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if the drink you just spilled, the train you just missed, or the lottery ticket you just found was not just a random occurrence? What if it’s all part of a bigger plan? What if there’s no such thing as a chance encounter? What if there are people we don’t know determining our destiny? And what if they are even planning the fate of the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Coincidence Makers—Guy, Emily, and Eric—three seemingly ordinary people who work for a secret organization devoted to creating and carrying out coincidences. What the rest of the world sees as random occurrences, are, in fact, carefully orchestrated events designed to spark significant changes in the lives of their targets—scientists on the brink of breakthroughs, struggling artists starved for inspiration, loves to be, or just plain people like you and me…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an assignment of the highest level is slipped under Guy’s door one night, he knows it will be the most difficult and dangerous coincidence he’s ever had to fulfill. But not even a coincidence maker can see how this assignment is about to change all their lives and teach them the true nature of fate, free will, and the real meaning of love.</description>

  <description>They were six university students from Oxford--friends and sometimes more than friends--spending an idyllic week together in a French farmhouse. It was supposed to be the perfect summer getaway--until they met Severine, the girl next door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Kate Channing, Severine was an unwelcome presence, her inscrutable beauty undermining the close-knit group's loyalties amid the already simmering tensions. And after a huge altercation on the last night of the holiday, Kate knew nothing would ever be the same. There are some things you can't forgive, and there are some people you can't forget, like Severine, who was never seen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a decade later, the case is reopened when Severine's body is found in the well behind the farmhouse. Questioned along with her friends, Kate stands to lose everything she's worked so hard to achieve as suspicion mounts around her. Desperate to resolve her own shifting memories and fearful she will be forever bound to the woman whose presence still haunts her, Kate finds herself buried under layers of deception with no one to set her free.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Lengard is a secret government facility for extraordinary people,” they told me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believed them. That was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn’t anyone else in the world like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m different. I’m an anomaly. I’m a monster. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, six months, fourteen days, eleven hours and sixteen minutes, Subject Six-Eight-Four — ‘Jane Doe’ — has been locked away and experimented on, without uttering a single word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jane’s resolve begins to crack under the influence of her new — and unexpectedly kind — evaluator, she uncovers the truth about Lengard’s mysterious ‘program’, discovering that her own secret is at the heart of a sinister plot … and one wrong move, one wrong &lt;i&gt;word&lt;/i&gt;, could change the world.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where, two centuries ago, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters’ return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only Penny sees what others cannot. And she will be forced to choose: save Bo, or save herself.</description>

Let’s find out ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tovi books are designed in a simple animated way to give young readers the impression of watching a short film where Tovi and his friends play out their adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The books are aimed at children aged 2-6 (picturebooks), who hopefully will join Tovi in his mini-adventures, and learn something about life and the world around them.

Let's find out ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tovi books are designed in a simple animated way to give young readers the impression of watching a short film where Tovi and his friends play out their adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The books are aimed at children aged 2-6 (picturebooks), who hopefully will join Tovi in his mini-adventures, and learn something about life and the world around them. As the lovable characters in these books share a whole range of experiences, they learn about sharing, about helping each other, and most important, they learn the value of friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll be surprised what an exciting time little penguins can have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tovi the Penguin is a children's book series. Also available to buy on Amazon: Tovi the Penguin - goes camping (Volume 1), Tovi the Penguin - goes away for Christmas (Volume 2), Tovi the Penguin - goes to London (Volume 3) and Tovi the Penguin - goes into space (Volume 4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.tovithepenguin.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.tovithepenguin.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>When young lawyer Lily marries Ed, she’s determined to make a fresh start and leave the secrets of the past behind. But then she takes on her first murder case and meets Joe, a convicted murderer to whom Lily is strangely drawn—and for whom she will soon be willing to risk almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lily is not the only one with secrets. Her next-door neighbor Carla may be only nine, but she has already learned that secrets are powerful things. That they can get her whatever she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lily finds Carla on her doorstep twelve years later, a chain of events is set in motion that can end only one way.</description>

  <description>In the thrilling sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Fourth Monkey&lt;/i&gt;, a new serial killer stalks the streets of Chicago, while Detective Porter delves deeper into the dark past of the Four Monkey Killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Porter and the team have been pulled from the hunt for Anson Bishop, the Four Monkey Killer, by the feds. When the body of a young girl is found beneath the frozen waters of Jackson Park Lagoon, she is quickly identified as Ella Reynolds, missing three weeks. But how did she get there? The lagoon froze months earlier. More baffling? She’s found wearing the clothes of another girl, missing less than two days. While the detectives of Chicago Metro try to make sense of the quickly developing case, Porter secretly continues his pursuit of 4MK, knowing the best way to find Bishop is to track down his mother. When the captain finds out about Porter’s activities, he’s suspended, leaving his partners Clair and Nash to continue the search for the new killer alone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Obsessed with catching Bishop, Porter follows a single grainy photograph from Chicago to the streets of New Orleans and stumbles into a world darker than he could have possibly imagined, where he quickly realizes that the only place more frightening than the mind of a serial killer is the mind of the mother from which he came.</description>

  <description>The ancient land of Éirinn is mired in war. Ciara, Princess of Mide, has never known a time when Éirinn’s kingdoms were not battling for power, or Northmen were not plundering their shores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Mide have thankfully always been safe because of Ciara’s unearthly ability to control her enemies’ minds and actions. But lately, a mysterious crow has been appearing to Ciara, whispering warnings of an even darker threat. Although her clansmen dismiss her visions as pagan nonsense, Ciara fears this coming evil will destroy not just Éirinn, but the entire world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the crow leads Ciara to Leif, a young Northman leader. Leif should be Ciara’s enemy, but when Ciara discovers that he, too, shares her prophetic visions, she knows he’s something more. Leif is mounting an impressive army, and with Ciara’s strength in battle the two might have a chance to save their world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With evil rising around them, they’ll do what it takes to defend the land they love…even if it means making the greatest sacrifice of all.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Abby Turner’s summer isn’t going the way she’d planned. She has a not-so-secret but definitely unrequited crush on her best friend, Cooper. She hasn’t been able to manage her mother’s growing issues with anxiety. And now she’s been rejected from an art show because her work “has no heart.” So when she gets another opportunity to show her paintings Abby isn’t going to take any chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is where the list comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby gives herself one month to do ten things, ranging from face a fear (#3) to learn a stranger’s story (#5) to fall in love (#8). She knows that if she can complete the list she’ll become the kind of artist she’s always dreamed of being. But as the deadline approaches, Abby realizes that getting through the list isn’t as straightforward as it seems… and that maybe—just maybe—she can’t change her art if she isn’t first willing to change herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first in a set of three standalone books with crossover characters.</description>

  <description>Hannah McCauley doesn’t look at herself in the mirror anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a rebellious past, she now attends a strict private school in a new town, where her recently divorced mother has put her on social lockdown. No driving. No bad grades. No skipping classes. No unapproved friends. No makeup. No boys. And the subject of her best friend from her old school is definitely forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah is being punished for something that happened a year earlier, something that she would like to put behind her. But strange occurrences frighten her, and she’s accused of breaking rules and doing other terrible things without any recollection of them. No one believes her, so she starts distrusting everything, even her own reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is she being haunted by her past? Stalked by someone with a grudge? Or is it all in her head? If she doesn’t figure out what’s happening fast, her existence could end up irreparably shattered.</description>

  <description>Kissing Max Holden was a terrible idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his father has a life-altering stroke, Max Holden isn't himself. As his long-time friend, Jillian Eldridge only wants to help him, but she doesn't know how. When Max climbs through her window one night, Jill knows that she shouldn't let him kiss her. But she can't resist, and when they're caught in the act by her dad, Jill swears it'll never happen again. Because kissing Max Holden is a terrible idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new baby sibling on the way, her parents fighting all the time, and her dream of culinary school up in the air, Jill starts spending more and more time with Max. And even though her father disapproves and Max still has a girlfriend, not kissing Max is easier said than done. Will Jill follow her heart and allow their friendship to blossom into something more, or will she listen to her head and stop kissing Max Holden once and for all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A suspense novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Maddy Clare...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 1950. &lt;/b&gt;There's a place for the girls whom no one wants--the troublemakers, the illegitimate, the too smart for their own good. It's called Idlewild Hall. And in the small town where it's located, there are rumors that the boarding school is haunted. Four roommates bond over their whispered fears, their budding friendship blossoming--until one of them mysteriously disappears. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 2014.&lt;/b&gt; As much as she's tried, journalist Fiona Sheridan cannot stop revisiting the events surrounding her older sister's death. Twenty years ago, her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. And though her sister's boyfriend was tried and convicted of murder, Fiona can't shake the suspicion that something was never right about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona discovers that Idlewild Hall is being restored by an anonymous benefactor, she decides to write a story about it. But a shocking discovery during the renovations will link the loss of her sister to secrets that were meant to stay hidden in the past--and a voice that won't be silenced. . . .</description>

Their daughter Anna is struggling to come to terms with her parents' deaths, unable to accept the verdict of suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with a young baby herself, she feels her mother's presence keenly and is determined to find out what really happened to her parents. But as Anna digs up the past, someone is trying to stop her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it's safer to let things lie . . .</description>

  <description>Audrey Rose Wadsworth and her partner-in-crime-investigation, Thomas Cresswell, are en route to New York to help solve another blood-soaked mystery. Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they’re delighted to discover a traveling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, privileged young women begin to go missing without explanation, and a series of brutal slayings shocks the entire ship. The disturbing influence of the Moonlight Carnival pervades the decks as the murders grow ever more freakish, with nowhere to escape except the unforgiving sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to Audrey Rose and Thomas to piece together the gruesome investigation as even more passengers die before reaching their destination. But with clues to the next victim pointing to someone she loves, can Audrey Rose unravel the mystery before the killer's horrifying finale?</description>

  <description>In this New York Times bestselling sequel to Kerri Maniscalco's haunting #1 debut Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer...or has the depraved prince been brought back to life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper's true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe's best schools of forensic medicine...and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her life's dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school's forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</description>

  <description>Skye Thorn has given tarot card readings for years, and now her psychic visions are helping the police find the town’s missing golden girl. It’s no challenge—her readings have always been faked, but this time she has some insider knowledge. The kidnapping was supposed to be easy—no one would get hurt and she’d get the money she needs to start a new life. But a seemingly harmless prank has turned dark, and Skye realizes the people she’s involved with are willing to kill to get what they want and she must discover their true identity before it’s too late.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;Children will fall in love with Snowman Paul! He is energetic and playful, he has big dreams and he is not afraid to be different. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Wonderful watercolor illustrations complement the narrative and bring the stories alive. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Join Dan and his playful best friend, Snowman Paul, on their fun winter adventures! &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Alaska, 1974.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.&lt;br /&gt;For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The Great Alone is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.</description>
