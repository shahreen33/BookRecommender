  <description>&lt;i&gt;Billy Winston’s family is going to see him happy and in love if it’s the last thing they do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one deserves a happily-ever-after quite as much as the second oldest Winston brother and his lady love, Claire McClure (aka Scarlet St. Claire). Cruelty and circumstance tore them apart almost twenty years ago. Secrecy and bitterness kept them separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know who's tired of their separation and stubbornness? Everyone. Especially Billy Winston’s family. And now they're going to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well-meaning interference means the star-crossed lovers can’t stop tripping over each other in the hills of Tuscany, the catacombs of Rome, and the waterways of Venice. Billy and Claire find themselves thrown together and at the mercy of the Winston siblings’ shenanigans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will their forced proximity bring them together? Or push them even further apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This second-chance romance brings back the entire Winston gang, playing cupid in one last story of love, hi-jinks, and family collusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;BEARD NECESSITIES is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, and can be read as a stand-alone, but it’s probably best read after books 0.5, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the Winston Brothers series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fiercely funny, queer romantic comedy about two girls who can't stand each other, but join forces in a grand feminist plan to expose harassment and inequality at their elite private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Harriet Price is the perfect student: smart, dutiful, over-achieving. Will Everhart is a troublemaker who's never met an injustice she didn't fight. When their swim coach's inappropriate behavior is swept under the rug, the unlikely duo reluctantly team up to expose his misdeeds, pulling provocative pranks and creating the instantly legendary Amelia Westlake--an imaginary student who helps right the many wrongs of their privileged institution. But as tensions burn throughout their school--who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Amelia Westlake?--and between Harriet and Will, how long can they keep their secret? How far will they go to make a difference? And when will they realize they're falling for each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning author Erin Gough's &lt;i&gt;Amelia Westlake Was Never Here&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, smart, and all-too-timely story of girls fighting back against power and privilege--and finding love while they're at it.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Melanie has spent her entire life working her way up in the world. By day, she studies at law school, and by night, she serves drinks at an exclusive club to afford her tuition. But the hard-working Melanie will never admit her true desire: to escape from her fast-paced, high-pressure life, if only for a moment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Melanie meets Vanessa, a glamorous executive and a regular at the club, she is drawn to the enigmatic black-haired woman. Vanessa is relentless in pursuing what she wants—and what she wants is Melanie. Soon, Melanie finds herself caught up in Vanessa’s sensual games of submission, power and control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Melanie insists that her affair with Vanessa remains purely physical. But as her limits are tested, so is the line between lust and love. When ghosts from the past reappear, both women must face their deepest fears. Can Melanie surrender her everything to Vanessa, or will old wounds prove too great?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;People lived because she killed.&lt;br /&gt;People died because he lived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the king. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya—but neither wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the king on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds—and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a richly detailed world inspired by ancient Arabia, &lt;i&gt;We Hunt the Flame&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Alisha Rai’s second novel in her Modern Love series, a live-tweet event goes viral for a camera-shy ex-model, shoving her into the spotlight—and into the arms of the bodyguard she’d been pining for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;OMG! Wouldn’t it be adorable if he’s her soulmate???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t see any wedding rings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breaking: #CafeBae and #CuteCafeGirl went to the bathroom AT THE SAME TIME!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute, Katrina King’s enjoying an innocent conversation with a hot guy at a coffee shop; the next, a stranger has live-tweeted the entire episode with a romantic meet-cute spin and #CafeBae is the new hashtag-du-jour. The problem? Katrina craves a low-profile life, and going viral threatens the peaceful world she’s painstakingly built. Besides, #CafeBae isn’t the man she’s hungry for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;He’s got a to die for. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the internet on the hunt for the identity of #CuteCafeGirl, Jas Singh, bodyguard, friend, and possessor of the most beautiful eyebrows Katrina’s ever seen, comes to the rescue and whisks her away to his family’s home. Alone in a remote setting with the object of her affections? It’s a recipe for romance. But after a long dating dry spell, Katrina isn’t sure she can trust her instincts when it comes to love—even if Jas’ every look says he wants to be more than just her bodyguard…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic and living off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: &lt;i&gt;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&lt;/i&gt; His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible union—holy matrimony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse than fire. Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love makes fools of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780062878021.

  <description>Audrey Rose Wadsworth and her partner-in-crime-investigation, Thomas Cresswell, are en route to New York to help solve another blood-soaked mystery. Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they’re delighted to discover a traveling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, privileged young women begin to go missing without explanation, and a series of brutal slayings shocks the entire ship. The disturbing influence of the Moonlight Carnival pervades the decks as the murders grow ever more freakish, with nowhere to escape except the unforgiving sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to Audrey Rose and Thomas to piece together the gruesome investigation as even more passengers die before reaching their destination. But with clues to the next victim pointing to someone she loves, can Audrey Rose unravel the mystery before the killer's horrifying finale?</description>

  <description>Reagan Cooper has been an out and proud lesbian since high school, but can't say no when her gay best friend, Jamie Miller, asks her to pretend to be his girlfriend for his family reunion. Jamie has been there for her through everything. Plus, she's interested in learning more about the family he never speaks of.&lt;br /&gt;Living in California for eight years, Charlie Miller has been able to live authentically, but being back in her small Maryland hometown with her conservative family means going back into the closet. What she didn't expect was to be so attracted to her brother's girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;54,300 words</description>

  <description>Things are going great for Sutton Kay, or at least they were. Her yoga studio is doing well, she’s living with her best friend, and she just got two kittens named Mocha and Cappuccino. Sure, she doesn’t have a girlfriend, but her life is full and busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her building is sold and the new landlord turns out to be the woman putting in a gym downstairs who doesn’t seem to understand the concepts “courtesy” and “don’t be rude to your tenants.” Sutton can’t get a read on Tuesday Grímsdóttir, but she can appreciate her muscles. Seriously, Tuesday is ripped. Not that that has anything to do with anything since she’s too surly to have a conversation with, and won’t stop pissing Sutton off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sutton’s life gets interesting after she dares Tuesday to make it through one yoga class, and then Tuesday gives Sutton the same dare. Soon enough they’re spending time working out together and when the sweat starts flowing, the sparks start flying. How is it possible to be so attracted to a person you can barely stand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when someone from Tuesday’s past shows up and Sutton sees a whole new side of Tuesday, will she change her mind about her grumpy landlord? Can she?</description>

  <description>Grab your dancing shoes and put on your prettiest dress. It's prom season in Blackwood Keep and forever can't wait any longer! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four Archer was the toughest girl around. Just ask anyone. She’s the street racing daredevil who brought the King of Brynwood Academy to his knees. But watching her boyfriend fawn over his childhood playmate—even though it was just an act—would be her toughest challenge yet. When jealousy rears its ugly head, Four questions if she can handle playing the sideline. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever McNamara has the world at his fingertips, but not even a private jet and a seven-figure trust fund can get him out of this rock and a hard place. When a childhood pact puts their fairytale in peril, Ever must risk it all to keep her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is strongly advised that you read The Peer and the Puppet and The Moth and the Flame before diving in. However, this 15K bonus novella is not a required reading to continue the When Rivals Play series. Content suitable for 18+.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘Beard With Me’ is the origin story of Billy Winston and Scarlet St. Claire (aka Claire McClure) and is just the beginning of their epic love story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at surviving than Scarlet St. Claire and making the best out of circumstances beyond her control is Scarlet’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, she’d be the last person on earth, hermitting like a pro, singing along to her CD Walkman, and dancing like no one is watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet is clever, Scarlet is careful, and Scarlet is smart . . . except when it comes to Billy Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at fighting than Billy Winston and raging against his circumstances—because nothing is beyond his control—is Billy’s specialty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an apocalyptic situation, he’d be the first person on earth to lead others to safety, overcome catastrophe, or die trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy is fearless, Billy is disciplined, and Billy is honorable . . . except when it comes to Scarlet St. Claire.</description>

  <description>Kinsley Scott is a lesbian romance author who doesn’t actually believe in love. While her alter ego, Laurel Lake, loves happy endings and epic love stories, Kinsley has a more cynical view of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Grace Harper is a hopeless romantic hanging on every word of the lesbian romance novels she reads. She believes her happy ending is right around the corner if she can just move on from the ex who cheated on her. When Grace's childhood best friend, Leah, suggests that she comes to Philly to get space from her ex, it seems like the perfect opportunity to start over, especially since Leah's roommate is none other than Laurel Lake - Grace's favorite romance author. &lt;br /&gt;Grace quickly learns that people aren't always how they appear online and is disappointed to find that Kinsley Scott is nothing like Laurel Lake. She's rude and vulgar and, unfortunately, irresistibly sexy. There is also much more to her than meets the eye, and as the two grow closer, her tough exterior is quickly stripped away, revealing much more than Grace ever bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;67,000 words</description>

  <description>Bea is on the run. And then, she runs into Lou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chance encounter sends them on a journey through West Texas, where strange things follow them wherever they go. The landscape morphs into an unsettling world, a mysterious cat joins them, and they are haunted by a group of threatening men. To stay safe, Bea and Lou must trust each other as they are driven to confront buried truths. The two women share their stories of loss and heartbreak—and a startling revelation about sexual assault—culminating in an exquisite example of human connection.</description>

  <description>I'm a wolf in wolf’s clothing, and I’ll consume her if she lets me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ambition. Passion. Betrayal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rita Award-winning author Kennedy Ryan delivers the epic first installment of the All the King's Men Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised to rule, bred to lead and weaned on a diet of ruthless ambition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world of haves and have nots, my family has it all, and I want nothing to do with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My path takes me far from home and paints me as the black sheep. At odds with my father, I'm determined to build my own empire. I have rules, but Lennix Hunter is the exception to every one of them. From the moment we meet, something sparks between us. But my family stole from hers and my father is the man she hates most. I lied to have her, and will do anything to keep her. Though she tries to hate me, too, the inexorable pull between us will not be denied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And neither will I.</description>

  <description>It was the same every morning. Wake up, grab the ice skates, and head to the rink while the world was still dark.&lt;p&gt;Weekends were spent in glitter and tights at competitions. Perform. Smile. And do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was good. She won. And she hated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten years, figure skating was Tillie Walden’s life. She woke before dawn for morning lessons, went straight to group practice after school, and spent weekends competing at ice rinks across the state. Skating was a central piece of her identity, her safe haven from the stress of school, bullies, and family. But as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls. The more Tillie thought about it, the more Tillie realized she’d outgrown her passion—and she finally needed to find her own voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Not all love stories are written the same way.

She doesn’t need his protection anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When life throws a curveball at All Saints’ golden boy, he’s forced to realize not all knights are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the greatest love stories flourish in tragedy.</description>

  <description>When Charlie transfers to the Georgia O’Keeffe College of Arts and Subtle Dramatics, she struggles to find her feet, but winds up exactly where she belongs...in the school’s (terrible) basketball team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a transfer student to the Georgia O’Keeffe College for Arts and Subtle Dramatics, former sports star Charlie is struggling to find her classes, her dorm, and her place amongst a student body full of artists who seem to know exactly where they’re going. When the school’s barely-a-basketball-team unexpectedly attempts to recruit her, Charlie’s adamant that she’s left that life behind…until she’s won over by the charming team captain, Liv, and the ragtag crew she’s managed to assemble. And while Charlie may have left cut-throat competition in in the dust, sinking these hoops may be exactly what she needs to see the person she truly wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From Carly Usdin (Heavy Vinyl) and artist Noah Hayes (Wet Hot American Summer, Goldie Vance) comes an ensemble comedy series that understands that it’s the person you are off the court that matters most.</description>

  <description>Kip Carmichael is no pretty boy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's a rough. Dirty. Giant. Hair so unruly, and a beard so thick, his friends on the team call him Sasquatch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time Sasquatch lays eyes on Theodora "Teddy" Johnson across the keg at a party one night on Jock Row, she'd been relegated to the sidelines by her jock-hungry "friends." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Week-after-week, he watches beautiful but bashful Teddy getting overshadowed, and overlooked. Sasquatch finally broad shoulders his way through the crowd, offering to to be her hairy godmother. But the minute their eyes meet? He's a goner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Teaching her the RULES for winning a jock will be the easy part. Not falling in love with her is going to be a losing game.</description>

  <description>Erika grew up with a set of expectations that she could never meet. She wasn't smart enough for her dad and she wasn't a good enough dancer for her mom. At college, she's retreated into a shell--dancing at night and avoiding people. The one person she can't escape is a local boxer named Tank. He's determined to show her that everything she's dreamed of can be hers if she would only see herself through his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tank believed boxing and babes didn't mix until he met Erika. He can't get enough of the the shy girl who rules his every thought, but she's wary of relationships. This is one fight he can't lose.</description>

  <description>Sara Walker’s life is going nowhere fast: she has a job she enjoys but doesn’t love, friends who are too busy to hang out with her, and no boyfriend in sight. Then a phone call on a lonely Friday night changes everything, and suddenly she’s spending her weekends with Laura. Newly single and openly bisexual, Laura makes Sara think decidedly not-straight thoughts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Laura Murphy, with her red hair, freckles, and killer curves, is any guy’s wet dream. But Laura’s done with guys for now, and it’s Sara who can’t stop dreaming about her. When Sara finally gives in to the curiosity, Laura blows her mind and pushes her further than she’s ever gone before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Laura makes it very clear that this is only a rebound fling, and she’s still planning to move to California. She’s more than happy to tie Sara up, but she’s not ready to be tied down. If Sara wants to keep her, she’s going to have to work hard to convince Laura that New York is worth staying for . . . and so is she.</description>

  <description>Susan, Esther, and Daisy started at university three weeks ago and became fast friends. Now, away from home for the first time, all three want to reinvent themselves. But in the face of handwringing boys, “personal experimentation,” influenza, mystery-mold, nu-chauvinism, and the willful, unwanted intrusion of “academia,” they may be lucky just to make it to spring alive. Going off to university is always a time of change and growth, but for Esther, Susan, and Daisy, things are about to get a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues #1-4.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Part-Time Grim Reaper. Full-Time Cutie!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most university students, Kim works a part-time job to make ends meet. Unlike most university students, Kim's job is pretty cool: she's a grim reaper, tasked with guiding souls into the afterlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most university students, Becka has a super intense crush. Unlike most university students, Becka's crush is on a beautiful gothic angel that frequents the underworld. Of course, she doesn't know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unaware of the ghoulish drama she's about to step into, Becka finally gathers up the courage to ask Kim on a date! But when she falls into a ghostly portal and interrupts Kim at her job, she sets off a chain of events that will pit the two of them against angry cat-dads, vengeful zombies, and perhaps even the underworld itself. But if they work together, they just might make it... and maybe even get a smooch in the bargain.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Two girls. One Kiss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person Riya Johnson expected to run into at her new summer camp is Courtney Chastain—her childhood best friend and the girl who broke her heart after a secret, mind-blowing, life-altering kiss. She definitely didn’t expect to be sharing a bunk bed with her for four long weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney has what every girl wants—she’s beautiful, rich, and the object of every boy’s desire at Camp Pine Ridge. Too bad none of them make her feel an iota of what Riya’s kiss did all those years ago. But Courtney needs to uphold appearances at all costs—even if it means instigating an all-out prank war with Riya as her main target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither girl can stop thinking about the other…but that doesn’t mean they can give up past hurts and take a chance on a future together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains drinking, sexual situations, and a fairy-tale romance sure to make your heart melt.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Return to the sensual and feral stirrings of the Phoenix Pack as a woman who’s already bound to one man is tempted by a wolf who’s bound only to his nightly desires.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cat shifter Mila Devereaux can’t help but see it as a betrayal. That her one true mate imprinted himself on another female was hard enough to accept. Struggling to be at peace with her loveless fate, she doesn’t fight the suggestion of entering an arranged mating. Then she meets Dominic, a pack enforcer with a notorious reputation. It’s in his very scent. This irresistible playboy—and delicious badass wolf—is making Mila’s fantasies come alive again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarming, compelling, and heady with sensual energy, Dominic is an expert at making women shed their inhibitions. Now everything about him—his killer smile, his perfectly sculpted body, and his smooth-as-honey voice—is drawing in a captivating new catch. But for the first time in his life, Dominic is feeling more than a fling. He finds himself tantalized by a female who makes him think of forever. He wants all of Mila and won’t be satisfied until he has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the passion grows wild, so does the risk. They’re falling in love in the shadows and secrets of their pasts. And it’s threatening to destroy everything Mila and Dominic are fighting for. And are destined for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Helloooo, Internet Land. Bitty here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y’all... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;not be ready for this. I may be a former junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;talented amateur pâtissier, but being a freshman on the Samwell University hockey team is a whole new challenge. It’s nothing like co-ed club hockey back in Georgia! First of all? There’s &lt;em&gt;checking.&lt;/em&gt; And then, there is Jack—our very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the megapopular webcomic series of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Check, Please!: #Hockey&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>Frankie Bellisario knows she can get anyone she sets her sights on, but just because she can doesn't mean she should—not when the person she's eyeing is Samara Kazarian, the daughter of a southern Republican senatorial candidate. No matter how badly Frankie wants to test her powers of persuasion, even she recognizes some lines aren't meant to be crossed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Frankie learns she's been on Samara's mind too, the idea of hooking up with her grows too strong to resist. Only Sam's not looking for a hookup; she wants—needs—the real thing, and she's afraid she'll never find it as long as Frankie's in her head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to choose between her first relationship and losing the girl who's been clawing her way under her skin, Frankie opts to try monogamy...under her own condition: 30 days of keeping things on the down low and remaining abstinent. If she fails as hard at girlfriending as she's afraid she might, she doesn't want to throw Samara's life into upheaval for nothing. But when neither the month nor Frankie's heart go according to plan, she may be the one stuck fighting for the happily ever after she never knew she wanted.</description>

  <description>Graphic Novel. "Amanda can’t figure out what’s so exciting about kissing. It’s just a lot of teeth clanking, germ swapping, closing of eyes so you can’t see that godzilla-sized zit just inches from your own hormonal monstrosity. All of her seven kisses had been horrible in different ways, but nothing compared to the awfulness that followed Kiss Number Eight. An exploration of sexuality, family, and faith, Kiss Number Eight is a coming-of-age tale filled with humor and hope." [First Second Books]</description>

  <description>I brought them to the wilderness because we couldn’t cope with our reality.&lt;br /&gt;The plan was to make a new life that didn’t include heartache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No people. No technology. No interference.&lt;br /&gt;Just us.&lt;br /&gt;A chance to piece together what was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wilderness is untamed and harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Brutal and unforgiving.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t give a damn about your feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tragedy lives there too.&lt;br /&gt;No escaping the truths that won’t let you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you can do is survive where love, no matter how beastly, is the only thing you can truly count on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confusing. Wrong. Twisted. Beautiful. Sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is wild.&lt;br /&gt;And we’re going to set it free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:&lt;br /&gt;The Wild is an extremely taboo story. Most will find that the themes in this book will make you incredibly uncomfortable. This book is only for the brave, the open-minded, and the ones who crave love in even the most dismal of situations. Extreme sexual themes and violence in certain scenes, which could trigger emotional distress, are found in this story. If you are sensitive to heavy taboo themes, then this story is not for you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a tragic accident takes the life of 17-year-old Raven Roth's foster mom--and Raven's memory--she moves to New Orleans to recover and finish her senior year of high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over isn't easy. Raven remembers everyday stuff like how to solve math equations and make pasta, but she can't remember her favorite song or who she was before the accident. And when impossible things start happening, Raven begins to think it might even be better not to know who she was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she grows closer to her new friends, her foster sister, Max, and Tommy Torres, a guy who accepts her for who she is now, Raven has to decide if she's ready to face what's buried in the past...and the darkness building inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kami Garcia and first-time graphic novel artist Gabriel Picolo comes this riveting tale of finding the strength to face who you are and learning to trust others--and yourself.</description>

  <description>Laura Dean, the most popular girl in high school, was Frederica Riley's dream girl: charming, confident, and SO cute. There's just one problem: Laura Dean is maybe not the greatest girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from her latest break up, Freddy's best friend, Doodle, introduces her to the Seek-Her, a mysterious medium, who leaves Freddy some cryptic parting words: break up with her. But Laura Dean keeps coming back, and as their relationship spirals further out of her control, Freddy has to wonder if it's really Laura Dean that's the problem. Maybe it's Freddy, who is rapidly losing her friends, including Doodle, who needs her now more than ever. Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnists like Anna Vice to help her through being a teenager in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O’Connell bring to life a sweet and spirited tale of young love that asks us to consider what happens when we ditch the toxic relationships we crave to embrace the healthy ones we need.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Award-winning author Alyssa Cole’s Reluctant Royals series continues with a woman on a quest to be the heroine of her own story and the duke in shining armor she rescues along the way…&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City socialite and perpetual hot mess Portia Hobbs is tired of disappointing her family, friends, and—most importantly—herself. An apprenticeship with a struggling swordmaker in Scotland is a chance to use her expertise and discover what she’s capable of. Turns out she excels at aggravating her gruff silver fox boss…when she’s not having inappropriate fantasies about his sexy Scottish burr&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavish McKenzie doesn’t need a rich, spoiled American telling him how to run his armory…even if she is infuriatingly good at it. Tav tries to rebuff his apprentice—and his attraction to her—but when Portia accidentally discovers that he’s the secret son of a duke, rough-around-the-edges Tav becomes her newest makeover project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forging metal into weapons and armor is one thing, but when desire burns out of control and the media spotlight gets too hot to bear, can a commoner turned duke and his posh apprentice find lasting love?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Neil Josten is the newest addition to the Palmetto State University Exy team. He's short, he's fast, he's got a ton of potential—and he's the runaway son of the murderous crime lord known as The Butcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signing a contract with the PSU Foxes is the last thing a guy like Neil should do. The team is high profile and he doesn't need sports crews broadcasting pictures of his face around the nation. His lies will hold up only so long under this kind of scrutiny and the truth will get him killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Neil's not the only one with secrets on the team. One of Neil's new teammates is a friend from his old life, and Neil can't walk away from him a second time. Neil has survived the last eight years by running. Maybe he's finally found someone and something worth fighting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'You look the type to break your father’s heart.'&lt;br /&gt;'Yeah, but he broke mine first.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rosie Gennaro first meets Jimmy Hailler, she has walked away from life in Sydney, leaving behind the place on Dalhousie that her father, Seb, painstakingly rebuilt for his family but never saw completed. Two years later, Rosie returns to the house and living there is Martha, whom Seb Gennaro married less than a year after the death of Rosie’s mother. Martha is struggling to fulfil Seb’s dream, while Rosie is coming to terms with new responsibilities. And so begins a stand-off between two women who refuse to move out of the home they both lay claim to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the battle lines are drawn, Jimmy Hailler re-enters Rosie’s life. Having always watched other families from the perimeters, he’s now grappling, heartbreakingly, with forming one of his own . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unforgettable story about losing love and finding love; about the interconnectedness of lives and the true nature of belonging, from one of our most acclaimed writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will Dimple and Rishi find their happily ever after? Find out in this funny, romantic, endlessly charming e-novella sequel to the New York Times bestseller When Dimple Met Rishi!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple Shah has a lot of opinions about marriage, but they boil down to this: It’s not for her. Sure, she loves her boyfriend, Rishi, but why does she need to validate that with an institution that has historically never favored the woman? Why go through all that hassle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel deeply disagrees. He believes in the power that comes with combining love and tradition, and when the time comes, wants nothing more than to honor those things in a huge celebration with his friends and family. He knows Dimple loves him, but in hearing her rant about how marriage is a “construct of hegemonic masculinity” for the millionth time, a small, niggling part of him worries that it’s not the institution of marriage Dimple has a problem with; maybe it’s him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lovebirds find themselves at a philosophical impasse. Can they find a way to work it out, or does kismet have other plans?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Debut author Sarah Smith nails this fun and sexy multicultural romance where two office foes hammer out their differences to build a love that will last...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmie Echavarre is a professional faker. She has to be to survive as one of the few female employees at Nuts &amp;amp; Bolts, a power tool company staffed predominantly by gruff, burly men. From nine to five, Monday through Friday, she's tough as nails--the complete opposite of her easy-going real self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing she doesn't have to fake? Her disdain for coworker Tate Rasmussen. Tate has been hostile to her since the day they met. Emmie's friendly greetings and repeated attempts to get to know him failed to garner anything more than scowls and terse one-word answers. Too bad she can't stop staring at his Thor-like biceps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emmie and Tate are forced to work together on a charity construction project, things get...heated. Emmie's beginning to see that beneath Tate's chiseled exterior lies a soft heart, but it will take more than a few kind words to erase the past and convince her that what they have is real.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tessa Bailey returns with a unique, sexy romantic comedy about a young married couple whose rocky relationship needs a serious renovation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie and Dominic Vega are the perfect couple: high school sweethearts, best friends, madly in love. Well, they used to be anyway. Now Rosie’s lucky to get a caveman grunt from the ex-soldier every time she walks in the door. Dom is faithful and a great provider, but the man she fell in love with ten years ago is nowhere to be found. When her girlfriends encourage Rosie to demand more out of life and pursue her dream of opening a restaurant, she decides to demand more out of love, too. Three words: marriage boot camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never in a million years did Rosie believe her stoic, too-manly-to-emote husband would actually agree to relationship rehab with a weed-smoking hippy. Dom talking about feelings? Sitting on pillows? Communing with nature? Learning love languages? Nope. But to her surprise, he’s all in, and it forces her to admit her own role in their cracked foundation. As they complete one ridiculous—yet surprisingly helpful—assignment after another, their remodeled relationship gets stronger than ever. Except just as they’re getting back on track, Rosie discovers Dom has a secret... and it could demolish everything.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The award-winning author of Finnikin of the Rock and Jellicoe Road pens a raw, compelling novel about a family’s hard-won healing on the other side of trauma.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning author Melina Marchetta reopens the story of the group of friends from her acclaimed novel Saving Francesca - but five years have passed, and now it’s Thomas Mackee who needs saving. After his favorite uncle was blown to bits on his way to work in a foreign city, Tom watched his family implode. He quit school and turned his back on his music and everyone that mattered, including the girl he can’t forget. Shooting for oblivion, he’s hit rock bottom, forced to live with his single, pregnant aunt, work at the Union pub with his former friends, and reckon with his grieving, alcoholic father. Tom’s in no shape to mend what’s broken. But what if no one else is either? An unflinching look at family, forgiveness, and the fierce inner workings of love and friendship, The Piper’s Son redefines what it means to go home again.</description>

  <description>The year is 2380, and the graduating cadets of Aurora Academy are being assigned their first missions. Star pupil Tyler Jones is ready to recruit the squad of his dreams, but his own boneheaded heroism sees him stuck with the dregs nobody else in the Academy would touch…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cocky diplomat with a black belt in sarcasm&lt;br /&gt;A sociopath scientist with a fondness for shooting her bunkmates&lt;br /&gt;A smart-ass techwiz with the galaxy’s biggest chip on his shoulder&lt;br /&gt;An alien warrior with anger management issues&lt;br /&gt;A tomboy pilot who’s totally not into him, in case you were wondering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ty’s squad isn’t even his biggest problem—that’d be Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley, the girl he’s just rescued from interdimensional space. Trapped in cryo-sleep for two centuries, Auri is a girl out of time and out of her depth. But she could be the catalyst that starts a war millions of years in the making, and Tyler’s squad of losers, discipline-cases and misfits might just be the last hope for the entire galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody panic.</description>

  <description>Jack and I, we did everything backward. The day he lured me into his office-which was also the first day we met-he proposed. You'd think a guy who looked like him-a bit cold maybe, but still striking and very unattainable-would only ask the love of his life to marry him, right? You'd think he must be madly in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. It was me he asked. A complete stranger who had never even heard of him. A stranger who had been dumped by her fiancé only weeks before. You'd think I'd laugh in his face, call him insane-and a few other names-then walk away as quickly as possible. Well…I did all those things except the walking away part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took him only minutes to talk me into a business deal…erm, I mean marriage, and only days for us to officially tie the knot. Happiest day of my life. Magical. Pop the champagne… Not. It was the worst day. Jack Hawthorne was nothing like what I'd imagined for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I blamed him for my lapse in judgment. I blamed his eyes, the ocean blue eyes that looked straight into mine unapologetically, and that frown on his face I had no idea I would become so fascinated with in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long after he said I was the biggest mistake of his life that things started to change. No, he still didn't talk much, but anyone can string a few words together. His actions spoke the loudest to me. And day after day my heart started to get a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One second he was no one. The next he became everything. &lt;br /&gt;One second he was unattainable. The next he seemed to be completely mine.&lt;br /&gt;One second I thought we were in love. The next it was still nothing but a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, I was Rose and he was Jack. We were doomed from the very beginning with those names. Did you expect anything else?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Alyssa Cole returns with a fun, sexy romance novella in the Reluctant Royals series! &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her boss the prince was busy wooing his betrothed, Likotsi had her own love affair after swiping right on a dating app. But her romance had ended in heartbreak, and now, back in NYC again, she’s determined to rediscover her joy—so of course she runs into the woman who broke her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Likotsi and Fabiola meet again on a stalled subway train months later, Fab asks for just one cup of tea. Likotsi, hoping to know why she was unceremoniously dumped, agrees. Tea and food soon leads to them exploring the city together, and their past, with Fab slowly revealing why she let Likotsi go, and both of them wondering if they can turn this second chance into a happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Shane has been doing college all wrong. Pre-med, stellar grades, and happy parents…sounds ideal -- but Shane's made zero friends, goes home every weekend, and romance…what’s that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her life has been dorm, dining hall, class, repeat. Time's a ticking, and she needs a change -- there's nothing like moving to a new country to really mix things up. Shane signs up for a semester abroad in London. She's going to right all her college mistakes: make friends, pursue boys, and find adventure! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done. She is soon faced with the complicated realities of living outside her bubble, and when self-doubt sneaks in, her new life starts to fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane comes to find that, with the right amount of courage and determination one can conquer anything. Throw in some fate and a touch of magic - the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From enemies to lovers and back to enemies, they’ve been on again/off again for years. Things come to a head when Callum gets into an altercation with a rival for Leanne’s affections. Their management decide enough is enough and give them both an ultimatum: sign the contract or leave the show. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unwilling to give up their livelihoods, Callum and Leanne sign on the dotted line. However, like always, they can’t resist making a bet. Callum thinks it’s only a matter of time before they break the agreement, while Leanne is determined to see it through. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can she resist him for an entire month without losing her sanity? And what if this is the one bet that finally breaks them both? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Off the Air is a contemporary romance and Book One in L.H. Cosway’s brand new “Running on Air” Series.

  <description>From the international bestselling author of DATING YOU, HATING YOU comes a new, unmissable standalone novel. 'A smart, sexy romance for readers who thrive on girl power' Kirkus Reviews on DATING YOU, HATING YOU For two sworn enemies, anything can happen during the Hawaiian trip of a lifetime -in this witty and swoonworthy romance from the New York Times bestselling duo behind JOSH AND HAZEL'S GUIDE TO NOT DATING. Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in . . . well, everything. Her identical twin sister Amy, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiance is something out of a romantic comedy (ugh) and she's managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of online contests (double ugh). Worst of all, she's forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man. Olive just has to get through twenty-four hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party - except for Olive and Ethan - gets food poisoning, there's an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs. Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him becomes a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds. But the weird thing is that she doesn't mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of . . . lucky. THE UNHONEYMOONERS is a heartwarming and hilarious romance perfect for anyone who has ever felt unlucky in love. Author BiographyChristina Lauren is the combined pen name of longtime writing partners/besties/soulmates and brain-twins Christina Hobbs and Lauren Billings, the New York Times, USA TODAY, and #1 international bestselling authors of the Beautiful and Wild Seasons series, Sublime, The House, and Autoboyography.</description>

It’s a powerful magic that many would kill to have on their side, especially amongst the nobility to which Safi was born. So Safi must keep her gift hidden, lest she be used as a pawn in the struggle between empires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iseult, a Threadwitch, can see the invisible ties that bind and entangle the lives around her—but she cannot see the bonds that touch her own heart. Her unlikely friendship with Safi has taken her from life as an outcast into one of reckless adventure, where she is a cool, wary balance to Safi’s hotheaded impulsiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safi and Iseult just want to be free to live their own lives, but war is coming to the Witchlands. With the help of the cunning Prince Merik (a Windwitch and ship’s captain) and the hindrance of a Bloodwitch bent on revenge, the friends must fight emperors, princes, and mercenaries alike, who will stop at nothing to get their hands on a Truthwitch.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;In which experienced West End actress Freddy Carlton takes on an Austen-inspired play, a scandal at a country estate, an enthusiastic search for a passion outside of acting…and the (some people might say icy*) heart of London’s most feared theater critic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*if those people were being nice&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddy Carlton knows she should be focusing on her lines for &lt;em&gt;The Austen Playbook&lt;/em&gt;, a live-action TV event where viewers choose the outcome of each scene, but her concentration’s been blown. The palatial estate housing the endeavor is now run by the rude (brilliant) critic who’s consistently slammed her performances of late. James “Griff” Ford-Griffin has a penchant for sarcasm, a majestic nose and all the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can’t take her eyes off him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griff can hardly focus with a contagious joy fairy flitting about near him, especially when Freddy looks at him like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. His only concern right now should be on shutting down his younger brother’s well-intentioned (disastrous) schemes—or at the very least on the production (not this one) that might save his family home from the banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead all he can think of is soft skin and vibrant curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he’s reluctantly dragged into her quest to rediscover her passion for the stage and Freddy is drawn into his research on a legendary theater star, the adage about appearances being deceiving proves abundantly true. It’s the unlikely start of something enormous…but a single revelation about the past could derail it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 99,000 words&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days&lt;/i&gt; gets a millennial makeover in this romantic comedy by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Andie J. Christopher.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Nolan is a gentleman, a journalist, and unlucky in love. His viral success has pigeon-holed him as the how-to guy for a buzzy, internet media company instead of covering hard-hitting politics. Fed up with his fluffy articles and the app-based dating scene as well, he strikes a deal with his boss to write a final piece de resistance: How to Lose a Girl. Easier said than done when the girl he meets is Hannah Mayfield, and he's not sure he wants her to dump him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah is an extremely successful event planner who's focused on climbing the career ladder. Her firm is one of the most prestigious in the city, and she's determined to secure her next promotion. But Hannah has a bit of an image problem. She needs to show her boss that she has range, including planning dreaded, romantic weddings. Enter Jack. He’s the perfect man to date for a couple weeks to prove to her boss that she’s not scared of feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Jack and Hannah know it, their fake relationship starts to feel all too real—and neither of them can stand to lose each other.</description>

  <description>Leanne Simmons and Callum Davidson are complete opposites. As soon as they meet they know they won’t get along. However, for the sake of their TV show they agree to put their differences aside, but it’s not as easy as they think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, there’s the unexplainable physical attraction they can’t seem to shake. And for two, everything out of their mouths seems to rub the other the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leanne wonders how she can be attracted to such a careless, narcissistic playboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callum wonders why he can’t get a girl who dresses like a boy out of his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Air Kiss&lt;/i&gt; readers will get to experience first-hand the trials and tribulations of the pair during the early days of &lt;i&gt;Running on Air&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3 weeks. 5 cities. 15 impossible stunts. One reality show.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Cross came into Reya Cabrera’s world with a bang and faded out with a whimper. They vowed to make it work, but life had other plans. After chasing his TV dreams for years, Trev finally became the UK’s next big reality star, but he alienated his family and friends in the process. Now he finally has everything he ever wanted. Women. Money. Fame. But none of it means anything when he doesn’t have the one thing that matters most: love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money leaves a gaping hole. Fame surrounds him with loneliness. And no woman makes him feel like Reya used to before the whirlwind of success pulled them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has a plan to get her back. However, with a hectic filming schedule looming, the only way to do that is to convince her to come on the road with him. Reya has been stuck in a rut for a while, and the opportunity to travel across Europe and play her music for new audiences seems like heaven. The only catch? She has to do it with the one boy who ever got close enough to break her heart. But he’s not a boy anymore, and as she gets to know him again she can’t deny her respect for the man he’s become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time she’s around him her heart feels full of air, like a balloon about to pop. Little does she know, Trev’s feelings are just as tumultuous as hers. One thing’s for sure, these three weeks on the road together will either make them whole again or break them irrevocably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Hearts on Air&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary romance and book #6 in the &lt;i&gt;Hearts&lt;/i&gt; series, however it can also be read as a complete standalone.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Trevor Cross had been my best friend for the better part of the last three years. He was also the most unique and unpredictable person I knew. Being around him often felt like trying to circumnavigate a minefield, and yet, I wouldn’t change him for the world. He was addictive, destructive, frustrating, fascinating. Too full of energy to ever pin down. Our friendship had been on a steady path until one wild and epic night that changed everything. He convinced me to throw caution to the wind, to stay out until the break of dawn and embrace new experiences. I never expected where the night would end, nor how it would alter our relationship for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Epic Night&lt;/i&gt; is a prequel story to the final &lt;i&gt;Hearts&lt;/i&gt; novel, &lt;i&gt;Hearts on Air&lt;/i&gt;.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey launches a super sexy new series featuring the blue collar men who work for a HGTV-esq house flipping business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an injury ends Travis Ford’s major league baseball career, he returns home to start over. He just wants to hammer out his frustrations at his new construction gig and forget all about his glory days. But he can’t even walk through town without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there’s Georgie, his buddy’s little sister, who is definitely not a kid anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle has crushed on her older brother’s best friend for years. The grumpy, bear of a man working for her family’s house flipping business is a far cry from the charming sports star she used to know. But a moody scowl doesn’t scare her and Georgie’s determined to show Travis he’s more than a pretty face and a batting average, even if it means putting her feelings aside to be “just friends.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis wants to brood in peace. But the girl he used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman who makes him feel whole again. And he wants her. So damn bad. Except Georgie’s off limits and he knows he can’t give her what she deserves. But she’s becoming the air he breathes and Travis can’t stay away, no matter how hard he tries...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;--- When a match meets gasoline. ---&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mona. &lt;/b&gt;Mafia princess. Rebellious Italian beauty. Runaway bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rain. &lt;/b&gt;Motorcycle club president’s daughter. Androgynous biker goddess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her sister was forced into an arranged marriage, Mona vowed she would never suffer the same fate. She would do whatever she had to, even set the church on fire, catch the first bus to nowhere without a dollar in her pocket while still wearing her wedding dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Away from her controlling family, Mona intends to fight for her financial independence on the stripping pole at the Smoke Valley Motorcycle Club. Her plan is to earn enough cash for further travels, but once she gets closer to Rain, and becomes more comfortable on the back of her bike than she ever was in the world of privilege, staying in the middle of Nowhere, Nevada no longer sounds so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain doesn’t do girlfriends. Her biker lifestyle means secrecy and unsavory deeds no girl she’s met would roll with. Her only goal is to smash the glass ceiling of her family-run biker gang and become the first female member. She does do flings though, and the Italian beauty who crashes her birthday party is perfect for one of those. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mona sticks around. Rain can’t stay away, and all rules go out the window when Rain finds out Mona is the runaway daughter of a mafioso. Maybe she could just be the kind of woman who understands living outside the law&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the mafia comes after Mona, Rain has to choose between loyalty to the club and the woman of her dreams. One thing is certain - there will be no escape without mayhem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Themes: mafia, organized crime, marriage, forbidden love, danger, motorcycle club, biker chick, family, rebellion, independence, first relationship, self-discovery&lt;br /&gt;Genre: F/F romance, suspense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic content: Explicit scenes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: ~60,000 words (STANDALONE novel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Adult content. Contains violence, distressing scenes, offensive language, and morally ambiguous protagonists.</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naked surfer. Habitual pothead. A con, a liar, a thief and a fraud. &lt;br /&gt;Last I heard, he was extorting the rich and screwing their wives for a living. &lt;br /&gt;Which is why I’m more than a little surprised to find him at my threshold, looking for my friendship, my services, and most puzzling of all—looking humbled. &lt;br /&gt;Thing is, I’m on a boycott. Literally—I cut boys from my life. Permanently. &lt;br /&gt;Problem is, Bane is not a boy, he is all man, and I’m falling, crashing, drowning in his sweet, perfect lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Carter&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hot as hell, cold as ice. &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t aware of her existence until a fat, juicy deal landed in my lap. &lt;br /&gt;She’s a part of it, a little plaything to kill some time. &lt;br /&gt;She is collateral, a means to an end, and a side-bonus for striking a deal with her oil tycoon stepdad. &lt;br /&gt;More than anything, Jesse Carter is a tough nut to crack. &lt;br /&gt;Little does she know, I have the teeth for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book contains material that might be offensive for some or elicit a strong emotional response. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Shouji has a girlfriend but is seeing Mako on the side. Unable to continue pretending she feels less for him than she does, she breaks it off with him. Shortly before that happens, Mako is hit on by Mika, who tells Mako that she's interested in both men and women. Mika wants to pursue a relationship with Mako, but is Mako's relationship with Shouji really over?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/i&gt; comes a romantic novel about love that crosses international borders and all boundaries of the heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions — like grief. And love. He thinks he's defective. His family knows better— that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can't turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn't go as planned. Esme's lessons in love seem to be working... but only on herself. She's hopelessly smitten with a man who's convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With Esme's time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he's been wrong all along. And there's more than one way to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rosie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that life is a beautiful lie and death a painful truth. They're right. &lt;br /&gt;No one has ever made me feel more alive than the guy who serves as a constant reminder that my clock is ticking. &lt;br /&gt;He is my forbidden, shiny apple. &lt;br /&gt;The striking fallacy to my blunt, raw, truth. &lt;br /&gt;He is also my sister's ex-boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;One thing you should know before you judge me; &lt;br /&gt;I saw him first. I craved him first. I loved him first. &lt;br /&gt;Eleven years later, he waltzed into my life, demanding a second chance. &lt;br /&gt;Dean Cole wants to be my bronze horseman. My white knight has finally arrived. Hopefully, he isn’t too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dean&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the brightest stars burn out the fastest. They’re right. &lt;br /&gt;She sets my mind on fire. &lt;br /&gt;All smart mouth, snarky attitude and a huge heart. &lt;br /&gt;In a world where everything is dull, she shines like fucking Sirius. &lt;br /&gt;Eleven years ago, fate tore us apart. &lt;br /&gt;This time, I dare it to try. &lt;br /&gt;Getting to her is a battlefield, but man, that’s why they call me Ruckus. &lt;br /&gt;Rosie LeBlanc is about to find out how hard I can fight. &lt;br /&gt;And conquering her will be the sweetest victory. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A smart young Muslim Canadian woman navigates the complexities of career, love, and family in this lively homage to a Jane Austen classic. "While it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single Muslim man must be in want of a wife, there's an even greater truth: To his Indian mother, his own inclinations are of secondary importance." With that nod to Pride and Prejudice firmly in place, Jalaluddin lays the groundwork for a raucous story that mixes a zany cast of characters with a tightly wound plot.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Forced to lie to protect her sister . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times Bestselling Author, Penny Reid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week.&lt;br /&gt;Home alone.&lt;br /&gt;Girl genius.&lt;br /&gt;Unrepentant slacker.&lt;br /&gt;Big lie.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona is a smart girl and figured everything out a long time ago. She had to. She didn’t have a choice. When your parents are uber-celebrities and you graduate from high school at fifteen, finish college at eighteen, and start your PhD program at nineteen, you don’t have time for distractions outside of your foci. Even fun is scheduled. Which is why Abram, her brother’s best friend, is such an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abram is a talented guy, a supremely gifted musician, and has absolutely nothing figured out, nor does he seem to care. He does what he feels, when he feels, and—in Mona’s opinion—he makes her feel entirely too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laws of Physics is the second trilogy in the Hypothesis series; Laws of Physics parts 1 (MOTION) &amp;amp; 2 (SPACE) end with a cliffhanger.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tess Bailey: the galaxy's Most Wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Tess Bailey is in deep trouble. She and her crew are on the run, pursued by a tyrant who'll take them dead or alive. Tess's best hope is a tall, dark, and much-too-appealing stranger, Shade Ganavan, who says he can help her. But his motivations are far from clear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shade Ganavan: arrogance, charm...and that special something that makes you want to kick him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the dreaded Dark Watch closing in, what Tess and Shade don't know about each other might get them killed...unless they can set aside their differences and learn to trust each other before it's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this daring and romantic fantasy debut perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; and Latinx authors Zoraida Córdova and Anna-Marie McLemore, society wife-in-training Dani has a great awakening after being recruited by rebel spies and falling for her biggest rival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Medio School for Girls, distinguished young women are trained for one of two roles in their polarized society. Depending on her specialization, a graduate will one day run a husband’s household or raise his children. Both paths promise a life of comfort and luxury, far from the frequent political uprisings of the lower class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniela Vargas is the school’s top student, but her pedigree is a lie. She must keep the truth hidden or be sent back to the fringes of society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And school couldn’t prepare her for the difficult choices she must make after graduation, especially when she is asked to spy for a resistance group desperately fighting to bring equality to Medio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Dani cling to the privilege her parents fought to win for her, or will she give up everything she’s strived for in pursuit of a free Medio—and a chance at a forbidden love?</description>

  <description>The thrilling second installment in New York Times bestselling author Tahereh Mafi’s Shatter Me series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have taken Juliette a single touch to kill Warner. But his mysterious immunity to her deadly power has left her shaken, wondering why her ultimate defense mechanism failed against the person she most needs protection from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and Adam were able to escape Warner’s clutches and join up with a group of rebels, many of whom have powers of their own. Juliette will finally be able to actively fight against The Reestablishment and try to fix her broken world. And perhaps these new allies can help her shed light on the secret behind Adam’s—and Warner’s—immunity to her killer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s world is packed with high-stakes action and tantalizing romance, perfect for fans of the Red Queen series by Victoria Aveyard and the Darkest Minds trilogy by Alexandra Bracken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ransom Riggs, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, raved: "A thrilling, high-stakes saga of self-discovery and forbidden love, the Shatter Me series is a must-read for fans of dystopian young-adult literature—or any literature!"</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HOW CAN IT BE WRONG &lt;br /&gt;IF IT FEELS SO &lt;i&gt;GOOD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dating an American princess comes with a massive amount of baggage–all of which I’m willing to carry strapped on my back in quicksand and through seven hells. But Jane Cobalt’s baggage, I’m unprepared for. It comes in the form of her five equally famous and notoriously hard-to-please brothers.  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;I want Jane.  &lt;br /&gt;Completely.  &lt;br /&gt;Unconditionally.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when there’s a trip scheduled that I can’t be a part of, I only have one option. It’s immoral.  &lt;br /&gt;Something I’d never consider until now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, hell, there’s got to be some perks to being a twin. So I’m doing it. I’m switching places with my brother.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Done and done.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There were little consequences.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until the storm hit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them. It must be read in the following order: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Like Us Series Reading Order:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Damaged Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow) &lt;br /&gt;2. Lovers Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow) &lt;br /&gt;3. Alphas Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow) &lt;br /&gt;4. Tangled Like Us (Jane &amp;amp; Thatcher) &lt;br /&gt;5. Sinful Like Us (Jane &amp;amp; Thatcher) &lt;br /&gt;6. Headstrong Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow) &lt;br /&gt;7. Charming Like Us (Oscar &amp;amp; Jack) &lt;br /&gt;8.

  <description>Scarlett is always the sensible one: The sober driver. The planner. The one holding your hair back while you're worshiping the porcelain gods. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Week-after-week, she visits Jock Row with her friends—the universities hottest party scene and breeding ground for student athletes. And if keeping her friends out of trouble, and guys out of their pants, was a sport, she'd be the star athlete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a well known jock-blocker gets her noticed for all the wrong reasons; just like that, she's banned from Jock Row. NO GUY WANTS A GIRL AROUND WHO KEEPS THEIR JOCK FRIENDS FROM GETTING LAID. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Rowdy" Wade is the hot shot short-stop for the universities baseball team—and the unlucky bastard who drew the short straw: keep little Miss Goody Two-Shoes out of the Baseball House. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But week-after-week Scarlett returns, determined to get inside. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They may not be made for each other, but animal instincts are impossible to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madisyn Drake is a rare breed of cat shifter…a loner, unpredictably wild, and emotionally distant. A recent betrayal has left her ready to sharpen her claws on the next man she sees…until a prowling wolf with steel-gray eyes and a brooding dark edge challenges her distrust. No matter how fully he satisfies her touch-hunger, Madisyn’s not ready to open up again, even if it is oh so gratifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracken Slater has earned his reputation as an indomitable predator. Once broken by grief and guilt, Brack is feeling alive again, thanks to the heady scent of this independent feline. Convincing her that they’re meant for each other is going to take more than branding Madisyn’s beautiful neck. She’s not interested in joining an unfamiliar pack, much less answering to an alpha. But when threats from both their pasts take shape, their unexpected destiny may be the only thing that can save them.</description>

  <description>Broadway hotshot Nik Kovalenko is a confirmed bachelor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ballroom champion Jess Davenport is a bona fide Scrooge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Last year, they shared a midnight kiss at a New Year’s Eve party that made both of them believe—briefly—in the magic of the holiday season. The magic was cut short when Nik went on tour the next day, but he never stopped thinking about that kiss—or Jess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the holidays roll back around, Nik runs into Jess again. He doesn’t want to spend another year pining for the Scrooge who got away, so he tells Jess he’ll stay if she’ll give him a shot at being her Christmas Present. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jess thinks he’s full of it, but she agrees to three dates. If Nik can make her believe in holiday magic in a place as un-wintery as Los Angeles—and convince her that he’s ready to stick around—she’ll give him a chance. But he won’t know until New Year’s Eve. If she kisses him at midnight, he’ll have his answer… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Alexis Daria: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“An author who clearly adores the world she’s developed—and the characters she’s matched.”—Sarah MacLean, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&amp;gt; bestselling author, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A charming and authentic voice.”—Sonali Dev, author of A Distant Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

He’s as prickly—and hot—as rumors paint him, but Kaya is unfazed…until she discovers that he’s a vampire!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaya quickly accustoms herself to scheduling his “dinner dates” and working odd hours, but can she handle it when Kyohei’s smoldering gaze starts turning her way?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reads R to L (Japanese Style) for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fate and fortune. Power and passion. What does it take to be the queen of a kingdom when you’re only seventeen?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maya is cursed. With a horoscope that promises a marriage of death and destruction, she has earned only the scorn and fear of her father’s kingdom. Content to follow more scholarly pursuits, her whole world is torn apart when her father, the Raja, arranges a wedding of political convenience to quell outside rebellions. Soon Maya becomes the queen of Akaran and wife of Amar. Neither roles are what she expected: As Akaran’s queen, she finds her voice and power. As Amar’s wife, she finds something else entirely: Compassion. Protection. Desire…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Akaran has its own secrets—thousands of locked doors, gardens of glass, and a tree that bears memories instead of fruit. Soon, Maya suspects her life is in danger. Yet who, besides her husband, can she trust? With the fate of the human and Otherworldly realms hanging in the balance, Maya must unravel an ancient mystery that spans reincarnated lives to save those she loves the most…including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 22 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh continues her Hard Play series with a sweet, sexy romance featuring big, fat, OTT weddings, a meddling grandma, and a too-serious hero who needs to be unbuttoned…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nayna Sharma agreed to an arranged marriage in the hope it would heal the fractures in her beloved family… only to realize too late that a traditional marriage is her personal nightmare. Panicked, she throws caution to the winds, puts on the tiniest dress she can find, and ends up in the arms of a tall, rough-edged hunk of a man who has abs of steel—and who she manages to mortally insult between one kiss and the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned as a child, then adopted into a loving family, Raj Sen believes in tradition, in continuity. Some might call him stiff and old-fashioned, but he knows what he wants—and it’s a life defined by rules… yet he can’t stop thinking about the infuriating and sexy woman who kissed him in the moonlight then disappeared. When his parents spring an introduction on him, the last woman he expects is her. Beautiful. Maddening. A rulebreaker in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s all wrong for her. She’s all wrong for him. And love is about to make rebels of them both.</description>

  <description>A bad boy can change a good girl forever. Rei is the school delinquent. Kira is shy and studious. What they see in each other is a mystery to their friends. What they find in each other is a miracle to themselves. With a style that is artistic and chic, this tale of restless and confused high school love will appeal to young women everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kira and Rei might as well be from different planets. She's a shy art student, afraid of boys and hated by her classmates. He's a rebellious motorcycle racer with girls dropping left and right just to talk to him. Their lives become intertwined when Kira asks Rei to model for her and, to everyone's surprise, he agrees. As these two battle their personal demons and the pressures of their classmates, they learn not only to love each other, but themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alisha Rai returns with the first book in her sizzling new Modern Love series, in which two rival dating app creators find themselves at odds in the boardroom but in sync in the bedroom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhiannon Hunter may have revolutionized romance in the digital world, but in real life she only swipes right on her career—and the occasional hookup. The cynical dating app creator controls her love life with a few key rules: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nude pics are by invitation only &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If someone stands you up, block them with extreme prejudice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Protect your heart &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only there aren't any rules to govern her attraction to her newest match, former pro-football player Samson Lima. The sexy and seemingly sweet hunk woos her one magical night... and disappears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhi thought she'd buried her hurt over Samson ghosting her, until he suddenly surfaces months later, still big, still beautiful—and in league with a business rival. He says he won't fumble their second chance, but she's wary. A temporary physical partnership is one thing, but a merger of hearts? Surely that’s too high a risk…</description>

  <description>Maddie and Theo have two things in common:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Alexa is their best friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They hate each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an “Oops, we made a mistake” kiss, neither one can stop thinking about the other. With Alexa’s wedding rapidly approaching, Maddie and Theo both share bridal party responsibilities that require more interaction with each other than they’re comfortable with. Underneath the sharp barbs they toss at each other is a simmering attraction that won’t fade. It builds until they find themselves sneaking off together to release some tension when Alexa isn’t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as with any engagement with a nemesis, there are unspoken rules that must be abided by. First and foremost, don’t fall in love.</description>

  <description>For as long as Josephine Alibrandi can remember, it’s just been her, her mom, and her grandmother. Now it’s her final year at a wealthy Catholic high school. The nuns couldn’t be any stricter—but that doesn’t seem to stop all kinds of men from coming into her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught between the old-world values of her Italian grandmother, the nononsense wisdom of her mom, and the boys who continue to mystify her, Josephine is on the ride of her life. This will be the year she falls in love, the year she discovers the secrets of her family’s past—and the year she sets herself free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with unmatched depth and humor, this novel—which swept the pool of Australian literary awards and became a major motion picture—is one to laugh through and cry with, to cherish and remember.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They came to earth—Pestilence, War, Famine, Death—four horsemen riding their screaming steeds, racing to the corners of the world. Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The day Jerusalem falls, Miriam Elmahdy knows her life is over. Houses are burning, the streets run red with blood, and a traitorous army is massacring every last resident. There is no surviving this, especially not once Miriam catches the eye of War himself. But when the massive and terrifying horseman corners Miriam, he calls her his wife, and instead of killing her, he takes her back to his camp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Miriam faces a terrifying future, one where she watches her world burn town by town, and the one man responsible for it all is her seemingly indestructible “husband”. But there’s another side to him, one that’s gentle and loving and dead set on winning her over, and she might not be strong enough to resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, if there’s one thing Miriam has learned, it’s that love and war cannot coexist. And so she must make the ultimate choice: surrender to War and watch humankind fall, or sacrifice everything and stop him.</description>

  <description>Dr. Russell has a bad reputation around our hospital. The scrub techs say he’s cold-blooded, the nurses say he’s too cocky for his own good, and the residents say he’s the best surgeon in the world—&lt;i&gt;really, just a swell guy!&lt;/i&gt;—on the off chance he’s within earshot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid him and his temper at all costs. It’s just as easy to admire his sexy, grip-it-while-he’s ravishing-you hair and chiseled jaw from a healthy distance, preferably from the other end of the hallway half-hidden behind a plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my plan crumbles when my trusty ol’ boss decides to swap his white coat for a Hawaiian shirt. His retirement leaves me with two terrible options: switch specialties and spend months retraining, or take an open position as Dr. Russell’s surgical assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means I have to stand near him in the OR for hours on end and anticipate his every need without letting his biting words and bad attitude intimidate me. Oh, and as if that’s not difficult enough, my silly crush on him—the one I’ve tried to stomp on until it disappears—might just be &lt;i&gt;reciprocated&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m fine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my job seriously. There will be no smoldering bedroom eyes across the operating table, no angry almost-kisses in the storage closet. (Well, no &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; of those.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s the phrase? An apple a day keeps the doctor away?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should go for a whole damn bushel.</description>

  <description>** Hoops Holiday consists of FULL-COURT PRESS, a HOOPS novella originally published in the TEAM PLAYER Anthology. It has been expanded with all-new, never-before-published content &amp;amp; epilogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes Christmas-themed bonus material for LONG SHOT (Iris &amp;amp; August) and BLOCK SHOT (Banner &amp;amp; Jared).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟-𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗥𝗧 𝗣𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗦*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MacKenzie Decker was a question Avery never got to ask, much less answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They met when she was a young reporter fueled by ambition, and the ink on Deck's first NBA contract was barely dry. Years later, they've climbed so high and lost so much, but one thing hasn't changed. The attraction that simmered between them in a locker room before is still there. With success like theirs, everything has been possible . . . except them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was then . . . but what about now?</description>

In the wake of the tragic death of Livia Blackthorn, the Clave teeters on the brink of civil war. One fragment of the Blackthorn family flees to Los Angeles, seeking to discover the source of the disease that is destroying the race of warlocks. Meanwhile, Julian and Emma take desperate measures to put their forbidden love aside and undertake a perilous mission to Faerie to retrieve the Black Volume of the Dead. What they find in the Courts is a secret that may tear the Shadow World asunder and open a dark path into a future they could never have imagined. Caught in a race against time, Emma and Julian must save the world of Shadowhunters before the deadly power of the &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt; curse destroys them and everyone they love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would you trade your soul mate for your soul?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Shadowhunter’s life is bound by duty. Constrained by honor. The word of a Shadowhunter is a solemn pledge, and no vow is more sacred than the vow that binds &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, warrior partners—sworn to fight together, die together, but never to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Carstairs has learned that the love she shares with her &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, Julian Blackthorn, isn’t just forbidden—it could destroy them both. She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it. Spurred on by a dark bargain with the Seelie Queen, Emma; her best friend, Cristina; and Mark and Julian Blackthorn journey into the Courts of Faerie, where glittering revels hide bloody danger and no promise can be trusted. Meanwhile, rising tension between Shadowhunters and Downworlders has produced the Cohort, an extremist group of Shadowhunters dedicated to registering Downworlders and “unsuitable” Nephilim. They’ll do anything in their power to expose Julian’s secrets and take the Los Angeles Institute for their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Downworlders turn against the Clave, a new threat rises in the form of the Lord of Shadows—the Unseelie King, who sends his greatest warriors to slaughter those with Blackthorn blood and seize the Black Volume. As dangers close in, Julian devises a risky scheme that depends on the cooperation of an unpredictable enemy. But success may come with a price he and Emma cannot even imagine, one that will bring with it a reckoning of blood that could have repercussions for everyone and everything they hold dear.</description>

  <description>The problem with secrets is that they’re too easy to keep collecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Allen has done some things she would rather no one ever know about. She also knows that, if she could go back in time, she wouldn’t change a single thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three sisters she loves, a job she (mostly) adores, and a family built up of friends she’s made over the years, Luna figures everything has worked out the way it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one of those secrets involves the man who signs her paycheck, she can’t find it in her to regret it. Despite the fact that he’s not the friendliest man in the world. Or the most patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes there are things you’re better off keeping to yourself.</description>

  <description>Gwen Miller may be a human, but she has no problem taking a stand against her own kind. She’s going to testify against the teenage boy she saw viciously assault a lone shifter female—and no amount of pressure from the boy’s wealthy family will make her back down. But when the harassment turns violent, help comes in the form of a lean, toned wolf with winter-gray eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guest at Gwen’s inn, shifter enforcer Zander Devlin can’t help but notice that the fierce and leggy brunette is in serious trouble. Since she’s putting herself at risk for one of his kind, keeping her safe is the least he can do. That’s not the only reason Zander wants her close. He desires her, even as the wolf inside him backs away from her. But his feral instincts are hard to keep down, and as they take shape, they’re harder for Gwen to resist. Then again, embracing them could be the only thing that could save her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE FLAME&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here lies Louchana Valentine. She was a homeless, orphaned virgin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never cared what my gravestone would say until I landed in deep with a powerful gangster. Lucky for me, my best friend happens to be ruthless too. I should feel guilty that he’s forced to turn on the man who’s been a father to him. Except I’ve always known that Wren’s soul wasn’t as black as he claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was good.&lt;br /&gt;He was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;He was mine.&lt;br /&gt;He just didn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with Wren keeping me safe, I’ve got time left to rewrite the end of my story. But if he has his way, &lt;i&gt;virgin&lt;/i&gt; is already carved in stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MOTH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never known anyone as alluring as Lou. Or as frustrating. Since the night she saved my life and stole my wallet for her troubles, I couldn’t stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She became my onus.&lt;br /&gt;My light.&lt;br /&gt;My…anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nowhere to run, I’m forced to trust someone I never expected. At least with Lou safe in Blackwood Keep—&lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; away from me—I’ll die with my conscience intact. Because she no longer looks at me with friendship in her eyes. Those iridescent blues shine with a different need entirely, and I’ve never been able to deny her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Moth and the Flame returns to the world of Blackwood Keep, rival gangs, and deliciously flawed yet completely addicting characters! This second installment in the When Rivals Play series is a continuation of the events that occurred in The Peer and the Puppet. &lt;/b&gt; Content suitable for ages 18+.</description>

  <description>In this New York Times bestselling sequel to Kerri Maniscalco's haunting #1 debut Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer...or has the depraved prince been brought back to life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper's true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe's best schools of forensic medicine...and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her life's dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school's forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Emilia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it’s true.The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares. He is a brilliant lawyer. A skilled criminal. A beautiful liar. A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn’t leaving until he takes me with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vicious&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a starving artist. Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom. Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down. She paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend’s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate. That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn’t. So she hates me. Big fucking deal. She better get used to me.</description>

A bottle of Jameson and a cracked skull gets my problem shipped to reform school, but I didn't bank on her returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four's out to get even, and she almost had the perfect plan: &lt;i&gt;expose the privileged kid moonlighting as a gangbanger.&lt;/i&gt; She's smart, but she'll have to be smarter. Sending her away won't be good enough this time. I'm going to have to tame the little troublemaker.

  <description>After an awkward first encounter, Birdie and Daniel are forced to work together in a Seattle hotel where a famous author leads a mysterious and secluded life in this romantic contemporary novel from the author of Alex, Approximately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystery-book aficionado Birdie Lindberg has an overactive imagination. Raised in isolation and homeschooled by strict grandparents, she’s cultivated a whimsical fantasy life in which she plays the heroic detective and every stranger is a suspect. But her solitary world expands when she takes a job the summer before college, working the graveyard shift at a historic Seattle hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new job, Birdie hopes to blossom from introverted dreamer to brave pioneer, and gregarious Daniel Aoki volunteers to be her guide. The hotel’s charismatic young van driver shares the same nocturnal shift and patronizes the waterfront Moonlight Diner where she waits for the early morning ferry after work. Daniel also shares her appetite for intrigue, and he’s stumbled upon a real-life mystery: a famous reclusive writer—never before seen in public—might be secretly meeting someone at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To uncover the writer’s puzzling identity, Birdie must come out of her shell…discovering that the most confounding mystery of all may be her growing feelings for the elusive riddle that is Daniel.</description>

I've yet to read a book from her that I haven't loved and I honestly don't think that will change any time soon. <br /><br />I don't feel like writing a full, normal formatted review right now so I'm going to give yo...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beware of the woods and the dark, dank deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: the new girl. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

      <![CDATA[<b>3.5 stars</b><br /><br />This is the perfect Halloween/spooky read filled with gore, female badassery and soft romances. Loved that we got not only a f/f romance but a MC who is asexual as well!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brady…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell do I know about raising a baby? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet here I am, the sole guardian of my niece. I’d be lost if it weren’t for Katherine, the beautiful girl who seems to have all the answers. Katherine, who’s slowly finding her way into my cynical heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep reminding myself that I can’t fall for someone when we don’t have a future. But telling myself this lie and believing it are two different things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katherine…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Brady shows up on a Harley, looking like an avenging angel—six feet, three inches of chiseled muscle, eyes the color of wild sage, and sun-kissed skin emblazoned with tattoos—I’m not sure if I should fall at his feet or run like hell. Because if I tell him what happened the night his family died, he might hate me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don’t count on are the nights we spend together trying to forget the heartache that brought us here. I promise him it won’t mean anything, that I won’t fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t make promises I can’t keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Author's note: Due to mature situations and sexual content, Shameless is recommended for readers 18+.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the popular Black Dagger Brotherhood series comes a brand-new novel about arson investigator, Anne Ashburn, who is consumed by her troubled past, her family’s scorched legacy, and her current case: chasing a deadly killer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Ashburn is a woman consumed...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By her bitter family legacy, by her scorched career as a firefighter, by her obsession with department bad-boy Danny McGuire, and by a new case that pits her against a fiery killer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strong-willed Anne was fearless and loved the thrill of fighting fires, pushing herself to be the best. But when one risky decision at a warehouse fire changes her life forever, Anne must reinvent not only her job, but her whole self.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shattered and demoralized, Anne finds her new career as an arson investigator a pale substitute for the adrenaline-fueled life she left behind. She doesn't believe she will ever feel that same all-consuming passion for her job again--until she encounters a string of suspicious fires setting her beloved city ablaze.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Danny McGuire is a premiere fireman, best in the county, but in the midst of a personal meltdown. Danny is taking risks like never before and seems to have a death wish until he teams up with Anne to find the fire starter. But Danny may be more than a distraction, and as Anne narrows in on her target, the arsonist begins to target her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the creator of the bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood, get ready for a new band of brothers. And a firestorm.</description>

Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a very public breakup with a media-hungry politician, fitness trainer Tori Alvarez escapes to Aruba for rest, relaxation, and copious amounts of &lt;i&gt;sex on the beach&lt;/i&gt;—the cocktail, that is. She vows to keep her vacation a man-free zone but when a cute guy is seated next to her on the plane, Tori can’t resist a little harmless flirting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood heartthrob Carter Stone underwent a dramatic physical transformation for his latest role and it’s clear his stunning seat mate doesn’t recognize the man beneath the shaggy beard and extra lean frame. Now Carter needs help rebuilding his buff physique and Tori is perfect for the job. It doesn’t hurt that she makes his pulse pound in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks are flying, until a pesky paparazzo reveals Carter’s identity. Tori is hurt and &lt;i&gt;pissed&lt;/i&gt;. She wants nothing to do with another man in the limelight, but she’s still got to whip him into shape. Can Carter convince Tori he’s worth the threat to her privacy that comes with dating a famous actor, or will Tori chisel him down to nothing before he even gets the chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grab the popcorn…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a really cute read! I've been meaning to read this one for a long while and I'm happy I finally took the time to give it a chance. I really loved Carter and I loved how sweet he is. He's what you would call a beta-male and honestly I am 100% here for more of those kind of heroes because...]]>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge and a &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;-like podcast following the clues she's left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray—a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America—overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. &lt;em&gt;Sadie&lt;/em&gt; is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

Which ok, obviously based off the synopsis you can tell this isn’t supposed to be a light read. But I don’t know, I guess I thought this...]]>

  <description>Five years after the destruction of the so-called rehabilitation camps that imprisoned her and countless other Psi kids, seventeen-year-old Suzume "Zu" Kimura has assumed the role of spokesperson for the interim government, fighting for the rights of Psi kids against a growing tide of misinformation and prejudice. But when she is accused of committing a horrifying act, she is forced to go on the run once more in order to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to clear her name, Zu finds herself in an uncomfortable alliance with Roman and Priyanka, two mysterious Psi who could either help her prove her innocence or betray her before she gets the chance. But as they travel in search of safety and answers, and Zu grows closer to the people she knows she shouldn't trust, they uncover even darker things roiling beneath the veneer of the country's recovery. With her future-and the future of all Psi-on the line, Zu must use her powerful voice to fight back against forces that seek to drive the Psi into the shadows and save the friends who were once her protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 New York Times best-selling author Alexandra Bracken comes a harrowing story of resilience, resistance, and reckoning that will thrill loyal fans and new readers alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Ruby can't look back. Fractured by an unbearable loss, she and the kids who survived the government's attack on Los Angeles travel north to regroup. Only Ruby can keep their highly dangerous prisoner in check. But with Clancy Gray, there's no guarantee you're fully in control, and everything comes with a price. &lt;br /&gt;When the Children's League disbands, Ruby rises up as a leader and forms an unlikely allegiance with Liam's brother, Cole, who has a volatile secret of his own. There are still thousands of other Psi kids suffering in government "rehabilitation camps" all over the country. Freeing them--revealing the governments unspeakable abuses in the process--is the mission Ruby has claimed since her own escape from Thurmond, the worst camp in the country.&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone is supportive of the plan Ruby and Cole craft to free the camps. As tensions rise, competing ideals threaten the mission to uncover the cause of IANN, the disease that killed most of America's children and left Ruby and others with powers the government will kill to keep contained. With the fate of a generation in their hands, there is no room for error. One wrong move could be the spark that sets the world on fire.</description>

He’d also like to forget her entirely, but that’s never going to happen. Roscoe remembers everything—every look, every word, every single unrequited second—and the last thing he needs is another memory of Simone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after one chance encounter, Simone keeps popping up everywhere he happens to be . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after Roscoe Winston dropped out of her life, all Simone Payton wants is to exploit him. She’d also like some answers from her former best friend about why he ghosted her, but if she never gets those answers, that’s a-okay. Simone let go of the past a long time ago. Seriously, she has. She totally, totally has. She is definitely not still thinking about Roscoe. Nope. She’s more than happy to forget he exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, she needs just one teeny-tiny favor . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Strange Beard is a full-length romantic comedy novel, can be read as a stand-alone, and is the fifth book in the USA TODAY bestselling Winston Brothers series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book two in the hit series that's soon to be a major motion picture!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby never asked for the abilities that almost cost her her life. Now she must call upon them on a daily basis, leading dangerous missions to bring down a corrupt government and breaking into the minds of her enemies. Other kids in the Children's League call Ruby "Leader", but she knows what she really is: a monster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ruby is entrusted with an explosive secret, she must embark on her most dangerous mission yet: leaving the Children's League behind. Crucial information about the disease that killed most of America's children-and turned Ruby and the others who lived into feared and hated outcasts-has survived every attempt to destroy it. But the truth is only saved in one place: a flashdrive in the hands of Liam Stewart, the boy Ruby once believed was her future-and who now wouldn't recognize her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ruby sets out across a desperate, lawless country to find Liam-and answers about the catastrophe that has ripped both her life and America apart-she is torn between old friends and the promise she made to serve the League. Ruby will do anything to protect the people she loves. But what if winning the war means losing herself?</description>

  <description>Ever since last year’s homecoming dance, best friends-turned-best enemies Zorie and Lennon have made an art of avoiding each other. It doesn’t hurt that their families are the modern-day Californian version of the Montagues and Capulets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a group camping trip goes south, Zorie and Lennon find themselves stranded in the wilderness. Alone. Together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no one but each other for company, Zorie and Lennon have no choice but to hash out their issues via witty jabs and insults as they try to make their way to safety. But fighting each other while also fighting off the forces of nature makes getting out of the woods in one piece less and less likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the two travel deeper into Northern California’s rugged backcountry, secrets and hidden feelings surface. But can Zorie and Lennon’s rekindled connection survive out in the real world? Or was it just a result of the fresh forest air and the magic of the twinkling stars?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>Hannah wants to spend her senior year of high school going to football games and Mardi Gras parties with her tight-knit group of friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing she wants is to fall in love with a girl--especially when that girl is her best friend, Baker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah knows she should like Wally, the kind, earnest boy who asks her to prom. She should cheer on her friend Clay when he asks Baker to be his girlfriend. She should follow the rules of her conservative Louisiana community--the rules that have been ingrained in her since she was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Hannah longs to be with Baker, who cooks macaroni and cheese with Hannah late at night, who believes in the magic of books as much as Hannah does, and who challenges Hannah to be the best version of herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Baker might want to be with Hannah, too--if both girls can embrace that world-shaking, yet wondrous, possibility.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Could you sacrifice the person you love to save your world?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is an immortal bad girl. With a mischievous smirk and a strike of her arrow, she pins human hearts together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Love has never loved. Not until she wreaks havoc in a frostbitten forest, hunting for the perfect mortal amusement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Andrew isn’t an easy target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t care that she’s a goddess. He’s a defiant loner who refuses to be toyed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer Love knows Andrew, the more she craves his touch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s forbidden. Worse, it’s fatal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans don’t have the power to annihilate deities. But Andrew is different. He wields a magic greater than he knows, a force strong enough to eradicate her kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By order of the Fates, Love has only two choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, destroy Andrew before he destroys her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or two, contain his power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price: In order to weaken him, she must seal his heart with someone else’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Mature young adult/new adult: sexual content and language. For readers 17 and older.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*New alternative cover edition. Original ASIN: B00OE7SWFA*</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Alyssa Cole comes the tale of a city Cinderella &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;and her Prince Charming in disguise . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between grad school and multiple jobs, Naledi Smith doesn’t have time for fairy tales…or patience for the constant e-mails claiming she’s betrothed to an African prince. Sure. Right. &lt;em&gt;Delete! &lt;/em&gt;As a former foster kid, she’s learned that the only things she can depend on are herself and the scientific method, and a silly e-mail won’t convince her otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Thabiso is the sole heir to the throne of Thesolo, shouldering the hopes of his parents and his people. At the top of their list? His marriage. Ever dutiful, he tracks down his missing betrothed. When Naledi mistakes the prince for a pauper, Thabiso can’t resist the chance to experience life—and love—without the burden of his crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and flirty friendship quickly evolves into passionate nights. But when the truth is revealed, can a princess in theory become a princess ever after?</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>THERE ARE NO DOUCHEBAGS IN THIS STORY. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, there are, but they’re not who this story is about. &lt;br /&gt;This story is about me—the coach’s daughter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I moved to Iowa to live with my dad, the university's take-no-prisoners wrestling coach, I thought transferring would be easy as pie—living with my father would be temporary, and he'd make sure his douchebag wrestlers left me alone. &lt;br /&gt;Wrong on both counts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ASSHOLES ALWAYS COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A bet is placed, and I'm on the table. After one humiliating night and too much alcohol, I find the last nice guy on campus. And when he offers to rent me his spare bedroom, I go all in. It’s time for the nice guy to finish first. &lt;br /&gt;Midnight chats and spilling my problems turn to lingering touches. Lingering touches turn to more. &lt;br /&gt;And the ultimate good guy has the potential do more damage than any douchebags ever could. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her story is a phenomenon. Her life is a disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, she’s LadyConstellation, the anonymous creator of the wildly popular webcomic &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves the online one, and she has no desire to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Wallace Warland, &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;’s biggest fanfiction writer, transfers to her school. Wallace thinks Eliza is just another fan, and as he draws her out of her shell, she begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.</description>

  <description>Film and TV director Carly Usdin (Suicide Kale, RuPaul's Drag Race) teams up with breakout artist Nina Vakueva for a new series that’s music to our ears! New Jersey, 1998. Chris has just started the teen dream job: working at Vinyl Mayhem, the local record store. She's prepared to deal with anything—misogynistic metalheads, grunge wannabes, even a crush on her wicked cute co-worker, Maggie. But when Rory Gory, the staff's favorite singer, mysteriously vanishes the night before her band’s show in town, Chris finds out her co-workers are doing more than just sorting vinyl...her local indie record store is also a front for a teen girl vigilante fight club!</description>

  <description>Alannah Ryan is plagued by an old face haunting her dreams, turning her waking hours into a mess of worry. Talking it out with the person she loves the most isn’t a possibility, not when the same face haunts him, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To protect the love of her life from another burden, she keeps her fear to herself, even as that fear begins to consume her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damien Slater has the life he always wanted with the woman he adores by his side, but there’s a problem. His woman is keeping a secret, and they swore they would never let another secret come between them again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Breaking Alannah’s guard will be Damien’s greatest challenge yet as he proves once and for all that he is in it for the long haul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alannah admires Damien, and what Alannah admires, Alannah watches over.</description>

  <description>Though DarkRiver sentinel Mercy is feeling the pressure to mate, she savagely resists when Riley Kincaid, a lieutenant from the SnowDancer pack, tries to possess her. The problem is not simply that he pushes her buttons; the problem is that he’s a wolf, she’s a cat, and they’re both used to being on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a brilliant changeling researcher is kidnapped from DarkRiver territory, Mercy and Riley must work together to track the young man—before his shadowy captors decide he’s no longer useful. Along the way, the two dominants may find that submitting to one another uncovers not just a deadly conspiracy, but a passion so raw that it’ll leave them both branded by fire…</description>

      <![CDATA[I've been on such a paranormal/fantasy/sci-fi kick recently, it seems to be the only thing I've been reading. And it was while I was looking through my books that I realized that I hadn't read a Psy-Changeling book in a really long time and on a random whim I decided that I needed to change that....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Time is running out. Together, they can save the world. But are they each other's worst nightmare?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova's double life is about to get a lot more complicated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Insomnia, she is a full-fledged member of the Renegades, a syndicate of powerful and beloved superheroes. She works with Adrian's patrol unit to protect the weak and maintain order in Gatlon City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nightmare, she is an Anarchist—a group of villains who are determined to destroy the Renegades. Nova wants vengeance against the so-called heroes who once failed her when she needed them the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Nova, her feelings for Adrian are deepening, despite the fact that he is the son of her sworn enemies and, unbeknownst to Nova, he has some dangerous secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this second installment of the Renegades trilogy, Nova, Adrian, and the rest of their crew—Ruby, Oscar, and Danna—are faced with escalating crime in Gatlon City, while covert weapons and conflicting missions have Nova and Adrian questioning not only their beliefs about justice but also the feelings they have for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line between good and evil has been blurred, but what's clear to them both is that too much power could mean the end of their City—and the world—as they know it.</description>

  <description>For fans of GILMORE GIRLS and TO ALL THE BOYS I'VE LOVED BEFORE, this effervescent love story from debut author Nina Moreno will sweep you away. Rosa Santos is cursed by the sea—at least, that's what they say. Dating her is bad news, especially if you're a boy with a boat. But Rosa feels more caught than cursed. Caught between cultures and choices. Between her abuela, a beloved healer and pillar of their community, and her mother, an artist who crashes in and out of her life like a hurricane. Between Port Coral, the quirky South Florida town they call home, and Cuba, the island her abuela refuses to talk about. As her college decision looms, Rosa collides—literally—with Alex Aquino, the mysterious boy with tattoos of the ocean whose family owns the marina. With her heart, her family, and her future on the line, can Rosa break a curse and find her place beyond the horizon?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36053955-stalking-jack-the-ripper" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presented by James Patterson's new children's imprint, this deliciously creepy horror novel has a storyline inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this dazzling debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They came to earth—Pestilence, War, Famine, Death—four horsemen riding their screaming steeds, racing to the corners of the world. Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Pestilence comes for Sara Burn’s town, one thing is certain: everyone she knows and loves is marked for death. Unless, of course, the angelic-looking horseman is stopped, which is exactly what Sara has in mind when she shoots the unholy beast off his steed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad no one told her Pestilence can’t be killed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the horseman, very much alive and very pissed off, has taken her prisoner, and he’s eager to make her suffer. Only, the longer she’s with him, the more uncertain she is about his true feelings towards her … and hers towards him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, well, Sara might still be able to save the world, but in order to do so, she'll have to sacrifice her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Author of &lt;i&gt;Act Like It&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pretty Face&lt;/i&gt; Lucy Parker returns readers to the West End, where it’s fireworks onstage and off in a sexy enemies-to-lovers showdown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, circus artist Trix Lane was the best around. Her spark vanished with her confidence, though, and reclaiming either has proved…difficult. So when the star of The Festival of Masks is nixed and Trix is unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight, it’s exactly the push she needs. But the joy over her sudden elevation in status is cut short by a new hire on the makeup team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo Magasiva: disgraced wizard of special effects. He of the beautiful voice and impressive beard. Complete dickhead and—in an unexpected twist—an enragingly good kisser. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Leo, something about Trix is…different. Lovely. Beautiful, even though the pint-size, pink-haired former bane of his existence still spends most of her waking hours working to annoy him. They’ve barely been able to spend two minutes together for years, and now he can’t get enough of her. On stage. At home. In his bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to commitment, Trix has been there, done that, never wants to do it again. Leo’s this close to the job of a lifetime, which would take him away from London—and from Trix. Their past is a constant barrier between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly impossible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 82,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the Carina Press Romance Promise: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carina Press acknowledges the editorial services of Deborah Nemeth</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Highly acclaimed, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Act Like It&lt;/i&gt; Lucy Parker returns readers to the London stage with laugh-out-loud wit and plenty of drama&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The play's the fling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not actress Lily Lamprey's fault that she's all curves and has the kind of voice that can fog up a camera lens. She wants to prove where her real talents lie—and that's not on a casting couch, thank you. When she hears esteemed director Luc Savage is renovating a legendary West End theater for a lofty new production, she knows it could be her chance—if only Luc wasn't so dictatorial, so bad-tempered and so incredibly sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luc Savage has respect, integrity and experience. He also has it bad for Lily. He'd be willing to dismiss it as a midlife crisis, but this exasperating, irresistible woman is actually a very talented actress. Unfortunately, their romance is not only raising questions about Lily's suddenly rising career, it's threatening Luc's professional reputation. The course of true love never did run smooth. But if they're not careful, it could bring down the curtain on both their careers…</description>

  <description>When half–wolf shifter Frankie Newman receives an e-mail from a family member she didn’t know existed, a secret is revealed: as a child, Frankie witnessed her father killing her mother…and then himself. Frankie was torn from her pack by her mother’s human relatives, and the trauma was erased from her memory. Realizing that she’s been lied to her entire life, she’s never felt more alone. Until she catches the scent of an old friend—warmly familiar and intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick Hardy, alpha wolf of the Phoenix Pack, can sense the rush of mutual attraction when he sees Frankie again. He knows immediately that she’s his true mate. But he also knows that, given her fragile state, he needs to tread with care—no matter how fierce his surging desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As aroused as Frankie is by Trick’s darkly dominant air and simmering desire, her priority right now is her past—not her future, no matter how tempting. But as more secrets emerge and Frankie’s life is threatened, Trick must do everything he can to keep her close and safe. After all, it’s their destiny.</description>

  <description>The climax of four years of X-Men stories is the X-Event of 2010! What started in &lt;i&gt;House of M&lt;/i&gt; with the Decimation of mutantkind and erupted with the first new mutant birth in &lt;i&gt;Messiah CompleX&lt;/i&gt; finishes here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the epic crossover &lt;i&gt;Second Coming&lt;/i&gt;, Cyclops' faith pays off when Cable returns to the present with Hope, the girl he believes to be the mutant messiah. But will she be the savior or destroyer of mutantkind? We may never know, as she is the target of an initiative for mutant eradication unlike anything the X-Men have ever experienced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many will be wounded. Several will die. Is Hope worth it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Second Coming&lt;/i&gt;: Prepare, 1-2; &lt;i&gt;Uncanny X-Men&lt;/i&gt; 523-525; &lt;i&gt;New Mutants&lt;/i&gt; 12-14; &lt;i&gt;X-Men Legacy&lt;/i&gt; 235-237; &lt;i&gt;X-Force&lt;/i&gt; 26-28</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Prelude in the &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young. Wealthy. Elite. Attractive. The gentlemen’s secret society at Yale was filled with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Nathaniel Radcliffe, the bane of my existence, was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the right hand of the American Gods, he was conceited and arrogant. A dangerously handsome man in a tailored custom suit and shiny black oxford loafers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classroom was our battlefield. We made a sport out of arguing and debating, ready to do anything in order to win over the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly opponents, deadlier minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd sworn I'd never give him the upper hand, until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret I’ve been hiding for the last three years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He just discovered it… and now he has all the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*35k Novella</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Hotheaded Prisoner&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Kingdom of Summer, they say she's wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked in a cage by the sea, Flare dreams of escape. She dreams of a lost world, known only in legends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The island is calling to her. And she won't let anyone keep her from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially not him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Coldhearted Prince&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say he's cruel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeryn has crossed the ocean for the Trade, to bargain for those fierce, imprisoned creatures that make his skin crawl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By law, they're subjects meant for experimentation. And easy to despise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One girl in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Mythical Shipwreck&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the cusp of transport, the tide rages. That uncharted island awaits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranded, the prince and prisoner must fight to survive. In this mysterious rainforest, they must band together...if they don't slay one another first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or become something more to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something just as dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Mature young adult/new adult: sexual content and language. For readers 17 and older.*</description>

  <description>In an unknown time and place, there's a war going on in space and mankind has developed a system of fighting that includes two sides of a team. One person is the fighter who pilots the spacecraft and his partner is the navigator who directs the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigators come from higher society and are mostly seen as privileged and intelligent. Fighters are men that are known for their violent tendancies, skills in combat, and anger issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abel didn't want to follow his politican father into his world and instead chose his own path as a navigator. He's gay and has always had strong desires that he's hidden... until he's partnered with his fighter, Cain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cain is unpredictable, violent, possessive, and very skilled at what he does. He goes through navigators faster then any other fighter so he's developed the reputation that he's impossible to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cain meets Abel, he marks him and possessives him in every way possible unknowingly giving Abel exactly what he's been craving for years. Now the only question is, will their relationship grow to benefit them both in this time of war or with Cain's reputation and violent tendancies end up destroying Abel?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was ok but I don't like how...rapey (is that a word?) this felt between the two main characters. It honestly made me a little uncomfortable because Cain acts like a possessive and complete over the top alpha male but in the most unhealthiest way. ]]>

One dollar . . . and I'm out. &lt;br /&gt;I've moved on. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve found success in a field ruled by men. &lt;br /&gt;Anything they can do, I have done better. &lt;br /&gt;They can keep the field while I call the shots, blocking them when I have to. &lt;br /&gt;And Jared has the nerve to think he gets a second chance? &lt;br /&gt;Boy, please. Go sit down. Have several seats. &lt;br /&gt;I'll just be over here ignoring the man carved from my fantasies with a lust-tipped chisel. &lt;br /&gt;Oh, I didn't say the struggle wasn't real. &lt;br /&gt;But I've got that one dollar, and Jared won't have me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There is a rule amongst his kind: A jester doesn’t lie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Kingdom of Spring, Poet is renowned. He’s young and pretty, a lover of men and women. He performs for the court, kisses like a scoundrel, and mocks with a silver tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet allow him this: It’s only the most cunning, most manipulative soul who can play the fool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Poet guards a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One the Crown would shackle him for. One that he’ll risk everything to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, it will take more than clever words to deceive Princess Briar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that he’s juggling lies as well as verse, this righteous nuisance of a girl is determined to expose him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all falsehoods are fiendish. Poet's secret is delicate, binding the jester to the princess in an unlikely alliance—and kindling a breathless attraction, as alluring as it is forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Mature young adult/new adult: sexual content and language. For readers 17 and older.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*New alternative cover edition. Original ASIN: B0175PMU8W.*</description>

  <description>THE PRINCE OF NO VALUE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brishen Khaskem, prince of the Kai, has lived content as the nonessential spare heir to a throne secured many times over. A trade and political alliance between the human kingdom of Gaur and the Kai kingdom of Bast-Haradis requires that he marry a Gauri woman to seal the treaty. Always a dutiful son, Brishen agrees to the marriage and discovers his bride is as ugly as he expected and more beautiful than he could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE NOBLEWOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ildiko, niece of the Gauri king, has always known her only worth to the royal family lay in a strategic marriage. Resigned to her fate, she is horrified to learn that her intended groom isn’t just a foreign aristocrat but the younger prince of a people neither familiar nor human. Bound to her new husband, Ildiko will leave behind all she’s known to embrace a man shrouded in darkness but with a soul forged by light. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two people brought together by the trappings of duty and politics will discover they are destined for each other, even as the powers of a hostile kingdom scheme to tear them apart.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was such a great book! I loved the friendship/relationship between Brishen and Ildiko the most. I love how even though it was an arranged marriage that neither really wanted, they started immediately as friends and decided "hey, if I'm going to have to marry you and spend the rest of my life...]]>

  <description>Siren and soulmate to the King of Night, Callypso Lillis survived the clutches of Karnon, the mad king, and his twisted prison. But the nightmare isn’t over. Callie wears the physical reminders of her time as a captive, and mounting evidence suggests the Thief of Souls is still out there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a fae celebration thrusts Callie and her mate, Desmond Flynn, into the Kingdom of Flora, they take their investigation with them. But under the bright lights and striking blooms of the realm, they find there are more immediate issues to deal with. No place is more uniquely savage than the great fae halls, and no amount of bargains can save Callie from royal intrigues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fairies play dangerous games. Some want love, some want vengeance, some want flesh, and some want things too unspeakable to utter. One thing is for sure: no one is who they appear to be. Not even Des, who only grows more enigmatic with every passing secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the Kingdom of Flora has its own secrets, from bleeding trees to branded slaves and missing guards. Something is stirring in the land of all that grows, and if Callie isn’t careful, it will claim everything and everyone she loves—and her along with it.</description>

  <description>Ryann Bird dreams of traveling across the stars. But a career in space isn’t an option for a girl who lives in a trailer park on the wrong side of town. So Ryann becomes her circumstances and settles for acting out and skipping school to hang out with her delinquent friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day she meets Alexandria: a furious loner who spurns Ryann’s offer of friendship. After a horrific accident leaves Alexandria with a broken arm, the two misfits are brought together despite themselves—and Ryann learns her secret: Alexandria’s mother is an astronaut who volunteered for a one-way trip to the edge of the solar system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night without fail, Alexandria waits to catch radio signals from her mother. And its up to Ryann to lift her onto the roof day after day until the silence between them grows into friendship, and eventually something more . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In K. Ancrum’s signature poetic style, this slow-burn romance will have you savoring every page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Imprint Book</description>

  <description>Callypso Lillis is a siren with a very big problem, one that stretches up her arm and far into her past. For the last seven years she’s been collecting a bracelet of black beads up her wrist, magical IOUs for favors she’s received. Only death or repayment will fulfill the obligations. Only then will the beads disappear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that if you need a favor, you go to the Bargainer to make it happen. He’s a man who can get you anything you want … at a price. And everyone knows that sooner or later he always collects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But for one of his clients, he’s never asked for repayment. Not until now. When Callie finds the fae king of the night in her room, a grin on his lips and a twinkle in his eye, she knows things are about to change. At first it’s just a chaste kiss—a single bead’s worth—and a promise for more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the Bargainer, it’s more than just a matter of rekindling an old romance. Something is happening in the Otherworld. Fae warriors are going missing one by one. Only the women are returned, each in a glass casket, a child clutched to their breast. And then there are the whispers among the slaves, whispers of an evil that’s been awoken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the Bargainer has any hope to save his people, he’ll need the help of the siren he spurned long ago. Only, his foe has a taste for exotic creatures, and Callie just happens to be one.</description>

  <description>Alannah Ryan had always suffered in silence, until that silence became so deafening she spilled secrets that she never intended to. At one point in her life, she yearned for adventure, a nail biting journey … something other than the mundane life she led. Her pleas were answered in the form of a tall, handsome heart breaker with a mop of white hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alannah’s dreams for an exciting twist in her life were shattered because of a teenage mistake. One that has haunted her for over five years, and left her in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damien Slater was the reason for every bad thing in the lives of those he loved most. A decision he made when he was just fifteen destroyed his brothers’ lives, and there was nothing he could do to change the things they had endured. Ruining them hurt, but ruining the only woman who wanted him for more than one night hurt a hell of a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running away helped Damien heal, and returning to Ireland only caused Alannah more pain. Pain he intended to eradicate and replace with the passion he knew they both shared. Breaking down her walls was not the only challenge Damien faced. Another had plans of his own, and his intentions weren’t for physical vengeance, but something far worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damien values Alannah above all else, and what Damien values, Damien fights for.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Branna Murphy is a survivor, a wife, a friend, a sister, and a soon-to-be-mother. She doesn’t have time to linger on anything, especially on a silly argument about how many children she will bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryder Slater is a hardass, a husband, a friend, a brother, and a soon-to-be-father. Unlike his wife, he has nothing but time to argue his case about how many children they will have… until that time is threatened to be taken away from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprise honeymoon deep in a beautiful forest for a secluded getaway was supposed to be fun, romantic and peaceful – until the storm of the century hits and both Branna and Ryder face a new enemy that has means to harm their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branna is consumed by her love for Ryder, and will fight to the end to keep her family safe. Branna treasures Ryder, and what Branna treasures, Branna defends.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Branna Murphy is broken. For months now she has been a part of a one-sided relationship to a man she loves more than life itself. She prayed for a miracle, and hoped something would change, but found that was wishful thinking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Talking didn’t work. Shouting didn’t work. Crying didn’t work. Nothing bloody worked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryder Slater is furious. For months now he has been lying to a woman he would take a bullet for in order to protect her. He is involved in something that goes deeper than his old past, and if he strays off target, people will start to die. People he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He couldn’t talk. He couldn’t slip up. He couldn’t lose focus. He couldn’t do a damn thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things between Ryder and Branna are at rock bottom, and Ryder knows it. Not only will he be taking on a force that could destroy his whole family, but he will be battling tooth and nail to save his relationship and keep the love of his life by his side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryder targeted Branna from the first moment he saw her, and what Ryder targets, Ryder dominates.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow this was soo good! I think Branna and Ryder might be my favorite couple! I usually don't like when books have flashbacks but it really worked in this book and I really enjoyed getting to see how their relationship first started all the way back from the first book.

  <description>Aideen Collins is fed up. She is at her wits’ end with her eon long pregnancy, her new-found paranoia, but mostly she is fed up with her boyfriend’s constant hovering and nit-picking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kane Slater is happier than ever. He is about to become a father for the first time with the woman he loves. Little does he know that Aideen is both literally and figuratively a ticking time bomb. He just has to survive a few more weeks of murderous hormonal outbursts, and all will be well… or so he hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re both caught up with the expected arrival of their little one, but in the back of their minds is a shadow that won’t fade away. Neither of them talk about it, but the shadow’s lingering presence casts doubt over their relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Phil worked his way into their minds many weeks ago and rooted himself as the haunting figure. Without even trying, he ruins things and causes problems. He watches them from afar, hoping he can break their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aideen’s instincts to protect her own are stronger than ever. If Big Phil wants to hurt those dearest to her, he is going to have one hell of a fight on his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aideen worships Kane, and what Aideen worships, Aideen shelters.</description>

  <description>Aideen Collins is a free spirit. She is outspoken and tough as nails, but she has to be after growing up in a house full of men. Family means everything to Aideen. Her family consists of her four brothers, her father, and her group of wild friends. Aideen is protective of her family, there is not a lot she wouldn’t do to keep them safe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kane Slater is a tortured soul. Literally. He is misunderstood by people, even feared by them thanks to the scars that mar his face and body. He relishes in their fear because people who fear you, won’t want to know you. He likes his circle limited to his brothers and their girlfriends, but a thorn from an Irish rose is dug deep into Kane’s side, and her name is Aideen Collins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aideen and Kane don’t get along… at all. Aideen is the only woman who stands up to Kane and throws his bullshit back at him without fear of hurting him. Kane is the only man who can see right through Aideen's tough exterior. He knows her deepest, and darkest secrets. They can’t stand each other, but they want each other. Badly. They hide their need behind arguments, and banter, but when Kane drops his guard for all to see, and succumbs to an illness within his body, it’s Aideen who steps up to the plate to take care of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An illness is the least of their worries when a devil from Kane’s past comes back to play with him. Everybody in Kane’s life is threatened, and with his body fighting against him, he doesn’t know if the luck of the Irish is enough to keep his family safe and his demons at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kane needs Aideen, and what Kane needs, Kane takes.</description>

  <description>All-American wide receiver Kyler Tate’s life is about to change. A fairytale college career skyrocketed him to the NFL draft. Adoration and opportunity are thrown in his direction wherever he goes, thanks to being chosen in the first round by the Los Angeles Rage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the accolades mean anything, though, without his high school sweetheart, Bree Sutton, by his side. Four years ago, she walked away from Kyler, choosing a quiet life over the flash and notoriety his career would someday bring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s back in their Indiana hometown, refusing to leave for Los Angeles without her. Demanding she give their life together a shot. Her heart never stopped bleeding for the love of her life, but Bree’s decision was final. Too bad their wild attraction has only been amplified by their separation, and Kyler won’t quit until Bree is wearing his ring.</description>

  <description>It seems the things worth keeping are often the hardest to hold... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KAI &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had two things in life that mattered. My mother and my music. &lt;br /&gt;Mama was taken from me too soon, and now music is all I have left. It’s the thing that’s pushed me right out of backwoods Georgia into Los Angeles, where the line between fantasy and reality shimmers and blurs. I’m finally making my way, making my mark. I can’t afford to fall for one of music's brightest stars. Not now. Music is all I have left, and I’m holding on tight with both hands. I won’t let go, not even for Rhyson Gray. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RHYSON &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had one thing in my life that mattered – music. The only constant, it’s taken me to heights most people only dream about; a gift dropped in my lap at birth. I thought it was enough. I thought it was everything until I met Kai. Now she’s all I think about, like a song I can't get out of my head. If I have to chase her, if I have to give up everything - I will. And once she's mine, I won't let go.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Twenty Boy Summer&lt;/i&gt; comes a “compelling and original” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) novel about a talented singer that loses her ability to speak after a tragic accident, leading her to a postcard-perfect seaside town to find romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The youngest of six talented sisters, Elyse d’Abreau was destined for stardom—until a boating accident took everything from her. Now, the most beautiful singer in Tobago &lt;i&gt;can’t&lt;/i&gt; sing. She can’t even speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking quiet solitude, Elyse accepts a friend’s invitation to Atargatis Cove. Named for the mythical first mermaid, the Oregon seaside town is everything Elyse’s home in the Caribbean isn’t: an ocean too cold for swimming, parties too tame for singing, and people too polite to pry—except for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian Kane is a notorious playboy—insolent, arrogant, and completely charming. He’s also the only person in Atargatis Cove who doesn’t treat Elyse like a glass statue. He challenges her to express herself, and he admires the way she treats his younger brother, Sebastian, who believes Elyse is the legendary mermaid come to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Christian needs a first mate for the Cove’s high-stakes Pirate Regatta, Elyse reluctantly suppresses her fear of the sea and climbs aboard. The ocean isn’t the only thing making waves, though—swept up in Christian’s seductive tide and entranced by the Cove’s charms, Elyse begins to wonder if a life of solitude isn’t what she needs.

I love how diverse this book was, and that it was a sex positive YA book but most importantly I love how realistic and at times, painful this book was to read. <br /><br />These characters aren't perfect and while we do see some character development,...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He's not a douchebag; but that doesn't stop his friends from turning him into one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MY FRIENDS WANT ME TO GET LAID.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much so that they plastered my ugly mug all over campus, in bold printed letters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you the lucky lady who's going to break our roommate's cherry?&lt;br /&gt;Him: socially awkward man with average-sized penis looking for willing sexual partner. You: must have a pulse. He will reciprakate with oral. Text him at: 555-254-5551&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morons can't even spell. And the texts I've been receiving are what wet dreams are made of. But I'm not like these douchebags, no matter how hard they try to turn me into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF ATTENTION I WANT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One text stands out from hundreds. One number I can't bring myself to block. She seems different. Hotter, even in black and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after seeing her in person, I know she's not the girl for me. But my friends won't let up--they just don't get it. Douchebags or not, there's one thing they'll never understand: &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;GIRLS DON'T WANT ME.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially her.</description>

  <description>Zeke Daniels isn't just a douchebag; he's an a**hole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total and complete jerk, Zeke keeps people at a distance. He has no interest in relationships—most a**holes don’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating?  &lt;br /&gt;Being part of a couple? Nope. Not for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's never given any thought to what he wants in a girlfriend, because he's never had any intention of having one. Shit, he barely has a relationship with his family, and they're related; his own friends don’t even like him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why does he keep thinking about Violet DeLuca? &lt;br /&gt;Sweet, quiet Violet—his opposite in every sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;The light to his dark, even her damn name sounds like rays of sunshine and happiness and shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that pisses him off, too.</description>

  <description>CRUDE. ARROGANT. A**HOLE.&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it, Sebastian ‘Oz’ Osborne is the university’s most celebrated student athlete—and possibly the biggest douchebag. A walking, talking cliché, he has a filthy mouth, a fantastic body, and doesn’t give a sh*t about what you or anyone else thinks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SMART. CLASSY. CONSERVATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, Jameson Clarke may be the university’s most diligent student—but she is no prude. Spending most of her time in the hallowed halls of the library, James is wary of pervs, jocks, and douchebags—and Oz Osborne is all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s smart, sarcastic—and not what he expected.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;…EVERY DOUCHBAG HAS HIS WEAKNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to be friends.&lt;br /&gt;He wants to spend time with her.&lt;br /&gt;He wants to drive her crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her.</description>

  <description>If someone were to ask Jasmine Santos to describe the last few years of her life with a single word, it would definitely be a four-letter one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seventeen years—and countless broken bones and broken promises—she knows her window to compete in figure skating is coming to a close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the offer of a lifetime comes in from an arrogant idiot she’s spent the last decade dreaming about pushing in the way of a moving bus, Jasmine might have to reconsider everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including Ivan Lukov.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How to protect your heart: &lt;br /&gt;Let your bodyguard have it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Cobalt is an American princess. The loyal and painfully curious twenty-three-year-old has inherited immense pressure to preserve the Cobalt legacy. But for Jane — sex, love, and life have been a series of royal failures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friends-with-benefits ended in disaster, she's sworn to a “no sex” hiatus for, well, eternity — and she has no intention of letting anyone in her bed and definitely not her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight-year-old Thatcher Moretti is painfully professional. As the stern 24/7 bodyguard to Jane, thinking about unbridled sex with his sweet client is a sin. One that he keeps committing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real act is a hard line he’d never cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a family member betrays Jane's trust, the media becomes obsessed with matchmaking the perpetually “single” Jane Cobalt and unwanted attention suddenly compromises her safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thatcher would do anything to protect her, and one solution may level the threats: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become the fake boyfriend to an American princess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwined together with boiling chemistry, new “professional” parameters, and an oath, unsaid feelings threaten to rise and change everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;​​The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Like Us Series Reading Order:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Damaged Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;2. Lovers Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;3. Alphas Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;4.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46690050-marriage-of-inconvenience" rel="nofollow"&gt;B075VVRTJ7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wall Street Journal and USA Today Bestseller&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Kat Tanner (aka Kathleen Tyson. . . and yes, she is *that* Kathleen Tyson): 1) She’s determined to make good decisions, 2) She must get married ASAP, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a billionaire heiress isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, it sucks. Determined to live a quiet life, Kat Tanner changed her identity years ago and eschewed her family’s legacy. But now, Kat’s silver spoon past has finally caught up with her, and so have her youthful mistakes. To avoid imminent disaster, she must marry immediately; it is essential that the person she chooses have no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and be completely trustworthy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, she knows exactly who to ask. Dan O’Malley checks all the boxes: single, romantically indifferent to her, completely trustworthy. Sure, she might have a wee little crush on Dan the Security Man, but with clear rules, expectations, and a legally binding contract, Kat is certain she can make it through this debacle with her sanity—and heart—all in one piece. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except, what happens when Dan O’Malley isn’t as indifferent—or as trustworthy—as she thought? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dimple Shah has it all figured out. With graduation behind her, she’s more than ready for a break from her family, from Mamma’s inexplicable obsession with her finding the “Ideal Indian Husband.” Ugh. Dimple knows they must respect her principles on some level, though. If they truly believed she needed a husband right now, they wouldn’t have paid for her to attend a summer program for aspiring web developers…right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel is a hopeless romantic. So when his parents tell him that his future wife will be attending the same summer program as him—wherein he’ll have to woo her—he’s totally on board. Because as silly as it sounds to most people in his life, Rishi wants to be arranged, believes in the power of tradition, stability, and being a part of something much bigger than himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shahs and Patels didn’t mean to start turning the wheels on this “suggested arrangement” so early in their children’s lives, but when they noticed them both gravitate toward the same summer program, they figured, Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple and Rishi may think they have each other figured out. But when opposites clash, love works hard to prove itself in the most unexpected ways.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;KINGDOMS WILL RISE AND FALL FOR HER…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cat” Catalia Fisa lives disguised as a soothsayer in a traveling circus. She is perfectly content avoiding the danger and destiny the Gods—and her homicidal mother—have saddled her with. That is, until Griffin, an ambitious warlord from the magic-deprived south, fixes her with his steely gaze and upsets her illusion of safety forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUT NOT IF SHE CAN HELP IT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin knows Cat is the Kingmaker, the woman who divines the truth through lies. He wants her as a powerful weapon for his newly conquered realm—until he realizes he wants her for much more than her magic. Cat fights him at every turn, but Griffin’s fairness, loyalty, and smoldering advances make him increasingly hard to resist and leave her wondering if life really does have to be short, and lived alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47170476-happily-ever-ninja" rel="nofollow"&gt;B016YOCL02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full length, 100k word novel, and is the 5th book in the Knitting in the City Series. All books in the series can be read as a standalone except book #1.5 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Fiona Archer… I would tell you what they are, but then I’d have to kill you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you that Fiona’s husband—the always irrepressible and often cantankerous Greg Archer—is desperately in love with his wife. He aches for her when they are apart, and is insatiable when they are together. Yet as the years pass, Greg has begun to suspect that Fiona is a ninja. A ninja mom. A ninja wife. A ninja friend. After fourteen years of marriage, Greg is trying not to panic. Because Fiona’s talent for blending in is starting to resemble fading away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, when unexpected events mean Fiona must take center stage to keep her family safe, her response stuns everyone—Greg most of all. It seems like Greg’s wish has come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except… not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done, can Greg handle this new version of his wife? Will his irrepressible cantankerousness push her away? Or can the couple find a way forward without either being forced to step back into the shadows?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This just in: romance takes center stage as West End theatre's Richard Troy steps out with none other than castmate Elaine Graham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Troy used to be the hottest actor in London, but the only thing firing up lately is his temper. We all love to love a bad boy, but Richard's antics have made him Enemy Number One, breaking the hearts of fans across the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have the tides turned? Has English rose Lainie Graham made him into a new man?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources say the mismatched pair has been spotted at multiple events, arm in arm and hip to hip. From fits of jealousy to longing looks and heated whispers, onlookers are stunned by this blooming romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could the rumors be right? Could this unlikely romance be the real thing? Or are these gifted stage actors playing us all?</description>

  <description>Book #2 in explosive new series from bestselling author Kit Rocha...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ana has trained most of her life to achieve one goal: to prove that anything men can do, she can do better. Now she’s Sector One’s first female Rider, and being the best is the only way to ensure she won’t be its last. Distractions aren’t allowed--especially not her painful attraction to the reserved but demanding leader whose stern, grumpy demeanor has already gotten into her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deacon has spent the last twenty years trying to atone for his past, but the blood he spilled as a mercenary and assassin will never wash away entirely. If his riders knew the extent of his sins, he’d lose their trust and respect. It’s easier to keep them all at arm’s length, especially Ana. But his newest recruit’s stubbornness is starting to crack his defenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And their sparring matches are driving him wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The passion sparking between them can’t be denied, but neither can the vengeance barreling toward Deacon. When his old squad comes back to punish him for his betrayal, Ana and the Riders are squarely in the line of fire. The only way to save his people may be to make the ultimate sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, he has to convince Ana not to follow him straight into hell.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first book in the follow-up to Kit Rocha's bestselling BEYOND series...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gideon's Riders, Book One&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Ashwin Malhotra is a Makhai soldier--genetically engineered to be cold, ruthless. Unfeeling. His commanding officers consider him the perfect operative, and they're right. Now, he has a simple mission: to infiltrate Gideon's Riders, the infamous sect of holy warriors that protects the people of Sector One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's never failed to execute an objective, but there's one thing he didn't anticipate--running into Dr. Kora Bellamy, the only woman to ever break through his icy exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kora fled her life as a military doctor for the Makhai Project, all she wanted was peace--a quiet life where she could heal the sick and injured. The royal Rios family welcomed her like a sister, but she could never forget Ashwin. His sudden reappearance is a second chance--if she can manage to touch his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the simmering tension between them finally ignites, Kora doesn't realize she's playing with fire. Because she's not just falling in love with a man who may not be able to love her back. Ashwin has too many secrets--and one of them could destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its immediate success in 1813, &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All bets are off. This time the gamble is survival.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo's new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she's always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to put a stop to Hideo's grim plans, Emika and the Phoenix Riders band together, only to find a new threat lurking on the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Someone's put a bounty on Emika's head, and her sole chance for survival lies with Zero and the Blackcoats, his ruthless crew. But Emika soon learns that Zero isn't all that he seems—and his protection comes at a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in a web of betrayal, with the future of free will at risk, just how far will Emika go to take down the man she loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game—it’s a way of life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape from reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down Warcross players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. To make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships—only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem . . . and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</description>

Everyone wants a piece of their relationship. And as a protective boyfriend, he’s not here for the malicious hands that grab at their love life and seek to rip them apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Farrow is confident — he’s confident that he could’ve never prepared for the storm to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep him safe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maximoff Hale isn’t a big fan of change. And to regain the charity CEO position he lost, he agrees to a task that he’s always rejected.

And with every breath, they promise that their love story won’t end here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;​​The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them.

      <![CDATA[<b> 4.5 stars </b> <br /><br />It's been a few days and I've been trying to formulate my thoughts about this book and how I could write a review without spoiling things and I've come to the conclusion that I really can't. So I'm going to keep this short and sweet. <br /><br />I started this book the moment I woke up on release...]]>

  <description>It’s crazy how fast the buzz comes back after you’ve been sober for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey stood there, on my doorstep, just like he had one year before. Except this time, there was no rain, no anger, no wedding invitation — it was just us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just him — the old friend, the easy smile, the twisted solace wrapped in a glittering bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just me — the alcoholic, pretending like I didn’t want to taste him, realizing too quickly that months of being clean didn’t make me crave him any less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can’t start here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, to tell this story right, we need to go back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the very first drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my love letter to Whiskey. I only hope he reads it.</description>

  <description>For the first time in her own words comes the personal story of a life filled with heartbreaking setback and triumph, from one of the most celebrated talents the world has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Celia Cruz passed away on July 17, 2003, more than a half million people stood in line for hours in order to pay their respects, in both Miami and New York. Millions more paid tribute to her, holding impromptu memorials in living rooms and crowded street festivals throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with the sound of her unmistakable voice, as fans played the songs that she will forever be remembered for, the Queen of Salsa's passing was marked with the same celebratory fervor Celia Cruz emulated throughout her life and career; a career that spanned the entire latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Celia Cruz's life had been largely mired in rumor and speculation. When she was alive, Celia Cruz never granted anyone total access to her life story and photo archive. Finally, comes a book that chronicles her own story, in her own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her modest childhood in Cuba to her exile years in Mexico to her remarkable career and life in America, Celia was a woman of contrasts. Her flamboyant costumes contrasted with her simple and straightforward demeanor. She was open and accessible to her fans, but staunchly private about her personal life. She was uninhibited without decadence, honest without offense, confident but not arrogant, and generous without fault. Yet above all, Celia was authentic, and it was this authenticity that resonated so deeply with her public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on more than five hundred hours of taped interviews recorded just months before her death, &lt;em&gt;Celia&lt;/em&gt; includes never-before-published personal photos and anecdotes, letting fans glimpse a life that, while lived in the full view of the public, had remained largely private.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celia celebrates the soul of a life blessed with talent -- strengthened by an unquestioned work ethic as well as an unwavering faith in God and humanity -- in these, her final words to the public she adored, and who equally loved her back.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The second book in Alexis Daria's dancing duology finds one playboy charmer falling for his new roommate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natasha Díaz is having a day. She’s trying to prove she can make it as a professional dancer, but she’s overworked, out of cash, and her roommate has just moved out. When she comes home to find a hole in her ceiling and her bedroom flooded, she’s desperate enough to crash with the one guy she can’t quit. She accepts his offer with one condition: no sleeping together while she’s living with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimitri Kovalenko has never lived with a woman before. But when Tasha’s in need of a place to stay, he suggests she move in without a second thought. He accepts her condition, hoping she won’t stick to it. They’re good together, both in the ballroom and the bedroom. Since their first dance, she’s never been far from his thoughts. Sure, she’s a pro and he’s one of her show’s judges, but they’re not currently filming, so no one needs to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in close quarters shows Dimitri a side of Natasha he’s never seen before, and he likes it. A lot. Too bad she’s doing everything in her power to keep him at arm’s length. When an injury forces Natasha to take it easy or risk her ability to dance, it’s his chance to show her that the rules have changed, and she can trust him with her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; "I've done far worse than what I went to prison for. She has no idea how bad this can get."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WINTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending him to prison was the worst thing I could've done. It didn't matter that he did the crime or that I wished he was dead. Perhaps I thought I'd have time to disappear before he got out or he'd cool off in jail and be anything but the horror he was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong. Three years came and went too fast, and now he's anything but calm. Prison only gave him time to plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I anticipated his vengeance, I didn't expect this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn't want to make me hurt. He wants to make everything hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAMON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing's first. Get rid of her daddy. He told them I forced her. He told them his little girl was a victim, but I was a kid, too, and she wanted it just as much as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two... Give her, her sister, and her mother nowhere to run and no fuel to escape. The Ashby women are alone now and desperate for a knight in shining armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's not what's coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it's time I listened to my father and took control of my future. It's time I showed them all--my family, her family, my friends--that I will never change and that I have no other ambition than to be the nightmare of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She'll be so scared, she won't even be safe in her own head by the time I'm done with her. And the best part is I won't have to break into her home to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the new man of the house I have all the keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Kill Switch is a romantic suspense suitable for readers 18+. It is advised to read Corrupt (Devil's Night #1) and Hideaway (Devil's Night #2) prior to reading this book. Both are available on Kindle Unlimited.</description>

  <description> As a lover of animals and nature, Beatrix Hathaway has always been more comfortable outdoors than in the ballroom. Even though she participated in the London season in the past, the classic beauty and free-spirited Beatrix has never been swept away or seriously courted-and she has resigned herself to the fate of never finding love. Has the time come for the most unconventional of the Hathaway sisters to settle for an ordinary man-just to avoid spinsterhood? Captain Christopher Phelan is a handsome, daring soldier who plans to marry Beatrix-s friend, the vivacious flirt Prudence Mercer, when he returns from fighting abroad. But, as he explains in his letters to Pru, life on the battlefield has darkened his soul-and it-s becoming clear that Christopher won-t come back as the same man. When Beatrix learns of Pru-s disappointment, she decides to help by concocting Pru-s letters to Christopher for her. Soon the correspondence between Beatrix and Christopher develops into something fulfilling and deep-and when Christopher comes home, he-s determined to claim the woman he loves. What began as Beatrix-s innocent deception has resulted in the agony of unfulfilled love-and a passion that can-t be denied-</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is everything she wants to avoid...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, Catherine Marks has been a paid companion to the Hathaway sisters—a pleasant position, with one caveat. Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. Cat can hardly believe that their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response—and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She is not at all what she seems...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. Catherine's respectable demeanor hides a secret that would utterly destroy her. But to Leo, Cat is intriguing and infernally tempting, even to a man resolved never to love again. The danger Cat tried to outrun is about to separate them forever—unless two wary lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was everything she'd sworn to avoid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Hathaway loves her unconventional family, though she longs for normalcy. Then fate leads to a meeting with Harry Rutledge, an enigmatic hotel owner and inventor with wealth, power, and a dangerous hidden life. When their flirtation compromises her own reputation, Poppy shocks everyone by accepting his proposal—only to find that her new husband offers his passion, but not his trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And she was everything he needed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry was willing to do anything to win Poppy—except to open his heart. All his life, he has held the world at arm’s length…but the sharp, beguiling Poppy demands to be his wife in &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; way that matters. Still, as desire grows between them, an enemy lurks in the shadows. Now if Harry wants to keep Poppy by his side, he must forge a true union of body and soul, once and for all...</description>

  <description>When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton. Even more challenging: the attraction she feels for the tall, dark, and dangerously handsome Cam Rohan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wealthy beyond most men’s dreams, Cam has tired of society’s petty restrictions and longs to return to his “uncivilized” Gypsy roots. When the delectable Amelia appeals to him for help, he intends to offer only friendship—but intentions are no match for the desire that blindsides them both. But can a man who spurns tradition be tempted into that most time-honored arrangement: marriage? Life in London society is about to get a whole lot hotter...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first book in a sizzling duology about dancers who find love from #OwnVoice's Alexis Daria.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina Morales wants to win. It’s her fifth season on The Dance Off, a top-rated network TV celebrity dance competition, and she’s never even made it to the finals. When she meets her latest partner, she sees her chance. He's handsome, rippling with muscles, and he stars on the popular Alaskan wilderness reality show Living Wild. With his sexy physique and name recognition, she thinks he’s her ticket to the finals—until she realizes they’re being set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Nielson hates Los Angeles, he hates reality TV, and he hates that fact that he had to join the cast of the The Dance Off because of family obligations. He can’t wait to get back to Alaska, but he also can’t deny his growing attraction to his bubbly Puerto Rican dance partner. Neither of them are looking for romantic entanglements, and Stone can’t risk revealing his secrets, but as they heat up the dance floor, it’s only a matter of time until he feels an overwhelming urge to take the lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tabloids catch on to their developing romance, the spotlight threatens to ruin not just their relationship, but their careers and their shot at the trophy. Gina and Stone will have to decide if their priorities lie with fame, fortune, or the chance at a future together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When girl meets Duke, their marriage breaks all the rules…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his return from war, the Duke of Ashbury’s to-do list has been short and anything but sweet: brooding, glowering, menacing London ne’er-do-wells by night. Now there’s a new item on the list. He needs an heir—which means he needs a wife. When Emma Gladstone, a vicar’s daughter turned seamstress, appears in his library wearing a wedding gown, he decides on the spot that she’ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His terms are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will be husband and wife by night only.&lt;br /&gt;- No lights, no kissing. &lt;br /&gt;- No questions about his battle scars.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s pregnant with his heir, they need never share a bed again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emma is no pushover. She has a few rules of her own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will have dinner together every evening.&lt;br /&gt;- With conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- And unlimited teasing.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s seen the man beneath the scars, he can’t stop her from falling in love…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A glorious empire . . .&lt;br /&gt;A desperate quest . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaol Westfall and Nesryn Faliq have arrived in the shining city of Antica to forge an alliance with the Khagan of the Southern Continent, whose vast armies are Erilea's last hope. But they have also come to Antica for another purpose: to seek healing at the famed Torre Cesme for the wounds Chaol received in Rifthold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enduring unspeakable horrors as a child, Yrene Towers has no desire to help the young lord from Adarlan, let alone heal him. Yet she has sworn an oath to assist those in need—and will honor it. But Lord Westfall carries shadows from his own past, and Yrene soon comes to realize they could engulf them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sweeping parallel novel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Empire of Storms&lt;/i&gt;, Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene will have to draw on every scrap of their resilience if they wish to save their friends. But while they become entangled in the political webs of the khaganate, deep in the shadows of mighty mountains where warriors soar on legendary ruks, long-awaited answers slumber. Answers that might offer their world a chance at survival—or doom them all . . .</description>

  <description>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the ex-boyfriend she &lt;i&gt;swore&lt;/i&gt; she'd never speak to again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRIEFING NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents—including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more—&lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.</description>

  <description>Welcome to New York City’s Upper East Side, where my friends and I live, go to school, play, and sleep—sometimes with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S is back from boarding school, and if we aren't careful, she’s going to win over our teachers, wear that dress we couldn’t fit into, steal our boyfriends’ hearts, and basically ruin our lives in a major way. I’ll be watching closely . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know you love me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo&lt;br /&gt;gossip girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the beautiful Serena van der Woodsen returns to Constance Billard and the Upper East Side after mysteriously getting kicked out of boarding school, the whole school is talking. All Blair Waldorf knows is that there's no way Serena's going to just waltz back in and steal everyone's heart again.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a good idea at the time. Look up Landon Roderick, that boy from childhood whom I’d never been able to forget—even though he so easily forgot about me—and call him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, anything sounds like a good idea when you’ve had a little too much wine before bed, right? It was supposed to be just a quick, meaningless, prank call. Instead, I went off on him—unloading thirteen years of pent-up emotions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think he’d call me back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly could never have anticipated the weeks of sexually tense phone conversations that followed as I got to know the man he’d become. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out, Landon had never really forgotten me, either. That special connection we had was still there. I opened up to him, but there were also things about me he didn’t know. And he had his own secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the countless hours we talked on the phone, I wondered what would happen if we actually saw each other. One night, I did something impulsive again. Only this time, I went to the airport and booked a ticket to California. We were about to find out if one phone call could bring two lost souls together or if my drunk dial really was all just a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete STANDALONE.</description>

  <description>Perfect for the fans of &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; who are desperately awaiting the release of &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, this novella-length digital original will bridge the gap between these two novels from the perspective of the villain we all love to hate, Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt;, Juliette escaped from The Reestablishment by seducing Warner—and then putting a bullet in his shoulder. But as she’ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt;, Warner is not that easy to get rid of. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the base and recovering from his near-fatal wound, Warner must do everything in his power to keep his soldiers in check and suppress any mention of a rebellion in the sector. Still as obsessed with Juliette as ever, his first priority is to find her, bring her back, and dispose of Adam and Kenji, the two traitors who helped her escape. But when Warner’s father, The Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment, arrives to correct his son’s mistakes, it’s clear that he has much different plans for Juliette. Plans Warner simply cannot allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set after &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; and before its forthcoming sequel, &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt; is a novella told from the perspective of Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wild Card is a standalone novel and the first book in the North Ridge Trilogy about rough and rugged Canadian mountain men, the Nelson brothers. Canada’s never felt so hot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She swore she’d never go back home.&lt;br /&gt;She swore she’d never see the man who broke her all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;But you don’t always get to choose your path.&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes that path is as wild and rugged as the heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Waters thought she saw the last of the small mountain town of North Ridge, British Columbia, when she left six years ago. But while her advertising career blossomed beneath the skyscrapers of Toronto, her mother’s sudden illness has the 26-year old returning to North Ridge to care for her, putting her career on hold while dealing with family secrets, regrets and unresolved goodbyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane Nelson has always been a bit of a wild card. The youngest of three brothers, Shane’s spent most of his life being underestimated and misunderstood. With his quiet intensity, classic good looks and thoughtful demeanor, he’s an enigma on horseback, managing his father’s sprawling ranch on the slopes of North Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;But while Shane remains the quintessential brooding cowboy, complete with an arsenal of inner demons, all of that changes when Rachel steps back into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was the girl he pushed away.&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s the girl who wishes she could leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the odds, Shane will do everything to convince Rachel he needs a second chance that he doesn’t deserve but when the two of them head off into the wilderness together in search of lost cattle, more than just their hearts are at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it's love or lives on the line, one thing is for sure: always bet on the wild card.</description>

  <description>Everything was fine until that innocent little rich girl walked into my garage. Since the second I laid my eyes on her, all I've wanted to do is get my dirty hands on her pure body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's one minor obstacle standing in my way, but I've got a plan. All I've got to do is claim her, and she’ll be mine forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Warning: This book is over-the-top, insta-love. There's nothing but steamy scenes, babies trying to be made, and an obsessed bearded alpha hero claiming a virgin who will be his forever. If you want it hot and dirty, this is it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*whispers* There's a sweet smutty surprise at the end! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He knows how to score, on and off the ice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won’t include the king of one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’ll take more than flashy moves to win her over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls…he’s a ladies man, all right, and he’s yet to meet a woman who’s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world—and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It’s not over until he says it’s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's a player in more ways than one…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College junior John Logan can get any girl he wants. For this hockey star, life is a parade of parties and hookups, but behind his killer grins and easygoing charm, he hides growing despair about the dead-end road he'll be forced to walk after graduation. A sexy encounter with freshman Grace Ivers is just the distraction he needs, but when a thoughtless mistake pushes her away, Logan plans to spend his final year proving to her that he's worth a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now he's going to need to up his game…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a less than stellar freshman year, Grace is back at Briar University, older, wiser, and so over the arrogant hockey player she nearly handed her V-card to. She's not a charity case, and she's not the quiet butterfly she was when they first hooked up. If Logan expects her to roll over and beg like all his other puck bunnies, he can think again. He wants her back? He'll have to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; for it. This time around, she'll be the one in the driver's seat, and she plans on driving him wild.</description>
