  <description>Hi, I’m Celestine Woods, most people call me Chellie. If you are one of my 850K followers, you might know me as the super successful Instagram influencer, but more than likely you probably know me as the woman who got dumped by her former rockstar boyfriend, who then publicly professed his love for his new girlfriend in a song on Spotify before getting engaged a week later. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I think I had a perfectly rational response to this news but my sponsors didn’t agree. Apparently no one wants to buy expensive skin cream from the woman who had an alcohol-fueled meltdown at the biggest New Year’s Eve party in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m at Black Bear Mountain Lodges, a cabin resort in the Catskill Mountains, to relax, recharge, and rehab my image and— tossing in a couple sponsored posts. The only hitch in my plan for R&amp;amp;R is the sexy, yet grumpy, lumberjack who runs the resort. His people skills leave a lot to be desired and it’s no wonder I’m the only guest at this place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;​ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know nothing about living in the mountains and he knows nothing about marketing and publicity. His resort and my image could both use a little TLC, so we formed a truce and teamed up to help each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between my social media know-how, my smartphone, a gorgeous grumpy mountain man and a strangely friendly bear that keeps coming to my window every night, we can get this all turned around right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who’s ready for project #ChellieInTheWoods? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A disgraced Instagram influencer uses a mountain retreat in an attempt to rehab her image with the help of a grumpy lumberjack, who is more than he appears to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novelette has NO cheating and is a standalone, contemporary shifter romantic comedy full of alphas, steam, and sarcasm.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This NHL star isn’t afraid to play dirty to get his girl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It started as a joke…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A throw away promise between friends. &lt;br /&gt;A dare for a single kiss at our reunion and nothing more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But that kiss… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That kiss was no joking matter. &lt;br /&gt;It was hot and wet. &lt;br /&gt;A hands-everywhere, breathless kind of insanity that left us both teetering on the brink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s got rules about dating guys like me… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules I respect the hell out of when they apply to any other pro athlete. &lt;br /&gt;But as they apply to me? Well, those rules are about to be broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A new comedy from the &lt;b&gt;USA Today&lt;/b&gt; bestselling duo!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good cop can always spot trouble. That’s why my senses started pinging the moment I met the hottie next door. The neighborhood may never be the same. First she confuses me for a male stripper and tries to remove my uniform. (The guys on the force will never let me live that down.) And then there’s the breaking and entering.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what to do with her. My libido has a few ideas of its own, though. Bad, bad ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, it’s not my fault that Hot Cop’s nightstick gets excited every time we see each other. And I can’t help that someone broke into his apartment. &lt;br /&gt;Fine—that last thing was totally my fault. And I intend to make amends. So when he needs a date for his sister’s wedding, I’m there. This is right up my alley. I’m an actor. By the time it’s over, his entire family will believe we’re a couple. &lt;br /&gt;Even him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; may cause unrestrained giggling in public. Contains: a bridezilla with a turkey leg, a flash mob, and a growly hero.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Miller “Buck” Butterson has been banging his way through life ever since a puck to the face fixed his messed up front teeth, and he was drafted into the NHL during his first year of college. After five years of deflecting goals on the ice and scoring them with puck bunnies across the Continental US and parts of Canada, Miller is ready for a girlfriend. A real girlfriend of the non-bunny variety. One he takes on dates and doesn’t jump into bed with after five seconds of conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller thinks he’s found that woman in his teammate’s sister. Except, unlike Alex Waters, center, team captain and all round nice guy—who happens to be dating his step-sister—Miller’s manwhore reputation is well earned, and not blown out of proportion by the media. Beyond that minor detail, Miller doesn’t know the first thing about having a girlfriend. But he’s determined to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t take into account is the amount of time and effort relationships require, or that constantly letting bunnies take selfies with him to post all over social media isn’t going to win him any points in the boyfriend department. Miller learns—not so quickly—that if he wants to make Sunshine “Sunny” Waters fall for him, he going to have to do a whole lot more than show her his stick skills in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 11 hours and 18 minutes</description>

  <description>Teddy King excels at many things. Playing hockey. &lt;i&gt;Check. &lt;/i&gt; Scoring on and off the ice. &lt;i&gt;Check. &lt;/i&gt; Being stupidly attractive ... &lt;i&gt;Double check. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew him way back when. Before he was the guy everyone wanted a piece of, he was just a rebellious college co-ed and one of my more &lt;i&gt;energetic&lt;/i&gt; study partners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But secrets have a way of getting out, and a steamy encounter from our college days (that we probably shouldn't have filmed) is about to cause a major scandal. Unless we can work together to stop it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy’s no stranger to hard work … but the thing he wants most?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This high-heat standalone is chock-full of scorching banter and steamy good times. He's a testosterone-dripping hockey player who wants a second chance. She's a tough as nails attorney intent on making partner. Loads of hot banter. No cliffhanger. Enjoy!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your favorite hot jocks are back with an all new stand-alone novel. If you like sexy, confident men who know how to handle a stick (on and off the ice), and smart women who are strong enough to keep all those big egos in check, this series of athlete romances is perfect for you!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Books can be enjoyed in any order.)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She has everything money can buy, but her bodyguard is all she wants—and together they’re exactly what each other needs in this heart-racing romance by Melissa Foster, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Call Her Mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actress Remi Divine is sick of bodyguards, sick of stalkers, and sick of feeling like she is always under a microscope. But this movie star isn’t helpless by any means. She’s got a rebellious streak, and she knows how to use it. First order of business: getting rid of the overbearing bodyguards who are sticking to her like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mason Swift has made protecting others his life, and when Remi ditches his two best men, he takes over and gives it everything he has. Having grown up in the foster-care system, and as a former special operative, he knows all the tricks. Nothing gets by him, especially not gorgeous, sneaky Remi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks she’s a diva. She thinks he’s arrogant. But when sparks turn to flames and their walls come down, their true hearts are revealed, and their connection is unstoppable. And when tragedy strikes, Remi realizes that being protected isn’t the worst thing in the world—but losing Mason just might be.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Machlin Saddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uber asshole, real estate mogul, sexy as hell and CEO of Saddler Enterprises, where I now work. Heartbreaking circumstances thrusts me into motherhood, and on the plane ride home, I break down, kissing a total stranger and the angel offered me a solution; Saddler Enterprises. I've climbed the ladder and worked my ass off for months, and in walks, Adam, our intern. I try to keep things professional but all of a sudden, I start to find him funny and charming. His kiss electrifies me but that's precisely when shit really hits the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I'm on the mysterious Machlin Saddler’s radar. Big, bad CEO that never makes his way to our floor, now makes it his new stomping grounds. He lights my body on fire like no one has before. He's alluring and gorgeous and I'm being pulled in two different directions. Only the new intern isn't who I think he is. He's the perfect stranger from the plane I took to start my new life with Kenzie. The perfect stranger I kissed. The perfect stranger I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genevieve Langston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breathtaking woman I haven't been able to keep my mind off of, has been my downfall. I need her like a lion needs prey but I can't screw up the plan. She'll hate me, hell she already does, but the line between love and hate is very, very thin.</description>

  <description>Walking wildfire Sam Owens gets Lillian hot in all the right ways, but there's more to the software CEO than just a pretty face. And a great body. And . . . Oh, right. He’s the enemy, according to the contract she signed with his rival. So when they secretly meet up for movies at The Electric, Lillian can't get too involved with Sam. She could lose her job. Her reputation. And her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam is in love with his company, his image, his video games, and his ability to avoid commitment--at least until he levels up with attorney Lillian Walker. With her love of campy horror flicks and a body that makes him want to howl like a cartoon wolf, Sam’s found his leading lady. Too bad getting close to Lillian means tangling with her boss, a supervillain in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the nights leading up to Christmas, movies at The Electric mean more than just mutant toads and cannibal fruitcakes. Between shenanigans with old flames and an arch nemesis out to destroy any future they might have, Sam and Lillian learn the hard way that falling in love isn’t as easy as it looks on screen. So when the past gets between them and a perfect The End, there’s really only one solution--if werewolf Santas can bring them together, zombie ex-girlfriends can keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, anything’s possible at The Electric.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey returns with a unique, sexy romantic comedy about a young married couple whose rocky relationship needs a serious renovation.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie and Dominic Vega are the perfect couple: high school sweethearts, best friends, madly in love. Well, they used to be anyway. Now Rosie’s lucky to get a caveman grunt from the ex-soldier every time she walks in the door. Dom is faithful and a great provider, but the man she fell in love with ten years ago is nowhere to be found. When her girlfriends encourage Rosie to demand more out of life and pursue her dream of opening a restaurant, she decides to demand more out of love, too. Three words: marriage boot camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never in a million years did Rosie believe her stoic, too-manly-to-emote husband would actually agree to relationship rehab with a weed-smoking hippy. Dom talking about feelings? Sitting on pillows? Communing with nature? Learning love languages? Nope. But to her surprise, he’s all in, and it forces her to admit her own role in their cracked foundation. As they complete one ridiculous—yet surprisingly helpful—assignment after another, their remodeled relationship gets stronger than ever. Except just as they’re getting back on track, Rosie discovers Dom has a secret... and it could demolish everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman with a plan—and the man who shakes it all up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Veronica Andersen might not need a man in her life, but in the bedroom . . . well, that’s a different story. With her eye on making partner at her father’s law firm, she doesn’t have time to think about much beyond a fling. So when she can’t get her mind off the hot young thing who walks her dog, Veronica knows exactly what to do.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Brian Walsh isn’t just a dog walker. He’s a former hockey pro who’s rebuilding his life after a career-ending injury on the ice. He’s taking his time and enjoying his current freedom—and the four-legged companionship. If only he could stop fantasizing about the best &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; legs he’s ever seen. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Brian and Veronica can’t help coming together. Again. And again. Suddenly, Veronica finds herself throwing all her best-laid plans out the window. Could she possibly have fallen in love with a man who’s wrong in every way—except the only one that matters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Five nights. Two adversaries. Only one bed in their hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm at the height of my hockey career. Yet my arrogant brother is always trying to recruit me into the family business: a global security company so secretive that I don't even know its name.&lt;br /&gt;Pass, thanks. I don't need a summer job.&lt;br /&gt;But the jerk ambushes me with a damsel in distress. That damsel is Alex, the competitive, sassy girl I knew when we were kids. Now she's a drop-dead gorgeous woman in deep trouble.&lt;br /&gt;So guess who's on a flight to Hawaii?&lt;br /&gt;It's going to be a long week in paradise. My job is keeping Alex safe, while her job is torturing me with her tiny bikinis. Or maybe we're torturing each other. It's all snark and flirting until the threat against Alex gets serious. And this jock must become her major league protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moonlighter is a stand-alone novel for Brooklyn Bruisers team member Eric Bayer. No cliffhangers, no prior experience necessary. Expect: a growly hero, a lady boss with no time for his attitude, and a war of wills and hormones. Bonus: a hunk wearing a baby in a sling.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>There’s more to me than just being awk-weird. I own my own flower shop, have some great friends, and I have my eye on adopting the most adorable kitten. But sadly, hot guys don’t tend to be blown away by my trivia-spouting, dorky self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a Thor-lookalike who happens to be a professional hockey player hits on me at my bestie’s wedding rehearsal party... You better believe I climbed that tree like a cat. And the fact that it happened not once, not twice, but three times? Yeah, that’s pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a woman like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s zero chance I’ll end up ever seeing him again... right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the pregnancy test comes up positive. What happens next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my God, I wish I knew…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A marriage of convenience and three nights a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s all the sultry, self-made billionaire wants from the impoverished prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the end of the year, she’ll grant him his divorce…with a settlement large enough to save his beloved kingdom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Latinx woman, Roxanne Medina has conquered small-town bullies, Ivy League snobs and boardrooms full of men. She’s earned the right to mother a princess and feel a little less lonely at the top. The offer she’s made is more than generous, and when the contract’s fulfilled, they’ll both walk away with everything they’ve ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Príncipe&lt;/em&gt; Mateo Ferdinand Juan Carlos de Esperanza y Santos is one of the top winegrowers in the world, and he’s not marrying and having a baby with a stranger. Even if the millions she’s offering could save his once-legendary wine-producing principality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the successful, single-minded beauty uses a weapon prince Mateo hadn’t counted on: his own desire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand-new standalone novel in the New York Times bestselling Briar U series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned after last year’s distractions cost my hockey team our entire season? No more screwing up. No more screwing, period. As the new team captain, I need a new philosophy: hockey and school now, women later. Which means that I, Hunter Davenport, am officially going celibate…no matter how hard that makes things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s nothing in the rulebook that says I can’t be &lt;i&gt;friends&lt;/i&gt; with a woman. And I won’t lie—my new classmate Demi Davis is one cool chick. Her smart mouth is hot as hell, and so is the rest of her, but the fact that she’s got a boyfriend eliminates the temptation to touch her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except three months into our friendship, Demi is single and looking for a rebound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she’s making a play for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoiding her is impossible. We’re paired up on a yearlong school project, but I’m confident I can resist her. We’d never work, anyway. Our backgrounds are too different, our goals aren’t aligned, and her parents hate my guts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooking up is a very bad idea. Now I just have to convince my body—and my heart.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Pucked series comes a romantic comedy about instant attraction, second chances, and not-so-little white lies.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need an escape from the demands, the puck bunnies, and the notoriety that come with being an NHL team captain. I just want to be a normal guy for a few weeks. So when I leave Chicago for some peace and quiet, the last thing I expect is for a gorgeous woman to literally fall into my lap on a flight to Alaska. Even better, she has absolutely no idea who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lainey is the perfect escape from my life. My plan for seclusion becomes a monthlong sex fest punctuated with domestic bliss. But it ends just as abruptly as it began. When I’m called away on a family emergency, I realize too late that I have no way to contact Lainey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, a chance encounter throws Lainey and me together again. But I still have a lie hanging over my head, and Lainey’s keeping secrets of her own. With more than lust at stake, the truth may be our game changer.</description>

  <description>From the New York Times bestselling author of Pucked and A Lie for a Lie, a new stand-alone romance about trading favors, battling wills, and winning love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I joined Seattle’s NHL expansion team, I thought it was the start of something great. But nothing ever goes the way you expect. Take my introduction to my new neighbor. She came rolling in on the hot mess express at midnight, making a racket while she tried to get into my team captain’s apartment. Did I mention that he’s married to a woman who definitely was not her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I end up with an injury that has me out of the game for weeks, and she’s the one to offer to help me. I should probably add that she’s not the captain’s mistress. She’s his sexy, pastel-haired younger sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we come up with an arrangement: she rehabs me so that I can get back on the ice sooner, and she can add a professional athlete that isn’t her brother to her client list. Seems simple enough. As long as I can keep my hands to myself and my hormones in check.</description>

  <description>Lexie Winters is on a mission—to lose her good girl image and tempt resident bad boy and professional tattoo artist, Ash Bodry, into her bed. Tired of being treated like his kid sister, it’s past time for her to play dirty. She has her work cut out for her though when it comes to the sinfully sexy yet incredibly frustrating man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Ash is concerned, Lexie is strictly off limits. Not only are they friends, her dad just happens to be the sheriff, and years ago the man steered Ash away from a life of crime. No way is he repaying that favor by giving into his wicked fantasies of Lexie. But when the little vixen strolls into his tattoo parlor and requests a very naughty piercing, Ash’s honorable intentions are tested to their limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Lexie’s hammered the first chink in Ash’s defenses, and he’s sweating bullets, there’s no chance in hell she’s settling for his hands off policy. Even if it means some flirty strip tease action and late night skinny dipping to convince him that this newfound naughty girl will do whatever it takes to get her man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains hot tattooed men, good girls gone bad, and sexy times on a beach. Sunscreen and a bucket of ice on standby is highly recommended.</description>

  <description>Professional hockey player Sergei Petrov has had a rough time after the tragic loss of his beloved wife. Playing hockey and taking care of his son are all he has time for; getting traded was not on the agenda. Neither was a sexy, hockey-playing nanny to further complicate things. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Star college athlete Danielle Cloutier may dominate the rink, but off the ice, she’s an amateur. She’s been trying to get rid of her virginity for years, but guys are always intimidated by her strength. That changes when she meets her new boss. Chemistry between them sizzles, hot enough to melt the most frozen of hearts, but Danielle can’t afford to get attached. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sergei doesn’t know what to do with the beautiful, stubborn woman, but watching her turn his new house into a home gives him a few ideas. Can he come to terms with his feelings before she skates out of his life for good? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>So much for the American Dream. After twenty years of marriage, successful careers, and two teenage boys, Angie and Mac’s relationship dissolves into disappointment and resentment. Overworked and underappreciated, the toll of their problems fizzles their dream of happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;Smacked in the face with failure, Steve “Mac” MacKey refuses to give up so easily, and strategizes how to win back his wife. So a plan to confront her by leveraging the boys backfires on him. In the most wonderfully unexpected way.&lt;br /&gt;Angie’s misery in marriage is topped only by her misery without Mac. When she confronts Mac in his office, she learns just how fine that line is between lust and anger. And when she thought her husband couldn’t care any less about her, he sparked a new fire inside her she didn’t know existed . . . that felt so damn good. &lt;br /&gt;Sex may not solve everything, and it’s a far cry from making any real changes, or fixing her emotional rollercoaster. &lt;br /&gt;Can they last that ride long enough to save their marriage, or are their rifts and broken promises too deep to cross?</description>

  <description>Working at Bliss, Sarah Harrison deals with all sorts of—interesting clientele. Yet no one sparks her interest more than Jared Gaines, the ultra-rich, ultra-sexy businessman who frequents her shop, buying delicate little “gifts” for the women in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day, Jared sends her a gift from Bliss. Then another—and another. So when Sarah walks into his office demanding to know why he can't stop sending her gifts, he makes her an offer she somehow can’t refuse: be his fake girlfriend for the weekend while attending his brother’s engagement party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing Sarah knows, she’s in San Francisco, pretending to be in love with Jared. Not that it’s a hardship. Once you get the man away from the office, he’s much more relaxed. Sweet. Funny. Even…thoughtful? Oh, and sexier than ever, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their pretend relationship feels very real, very quickly. Soon Sarah’s in over her head. Could what she and Jared share turn into something real? Or is it all actually…fake?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jaci Burton celebrates the gift of love and the holiday season with a snowy Christmas wedding at the Bellini family vineyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stranded at the Red Moss Vineyard a week before her best friend's wedding, LA native and professional matchmaker Alice Weatherford is not pleased with her first trip to Oklahoma, or the epic snowstorm forcing her to stay. So much for Christmas cheer. What she needs is a project, something to distract her...and, oh, has she found one in neighboring rancher Clay Henry. Gorgeous, charming, and unlike any other man she's ever met, finding the right woman for Clay should be easy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Having grown up with the Bellini sisters, it's no hardship for Clay to ride out the storm at their cozy family vineyard, especially since that means spending time with their savvy and smart houseguest. But despite Alice’s best efforts, he's not the least bit interested in her matchmaking....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice is the only woman Clay wants. Now he just has to convince the matchmaker herself to give love a chance.</description>

  <description>Today is the biggest day of my professional career. I’ve got one shot to prove I can play with the big boys and the Lachlan account is my ticket. I’ve never been more prepared for anything in my life. So of course that went up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, stopping to get my chocolate milk fix right before the big meeting might not have been the best decision. Neither was fighting for the last jug with a flirty Thor-lookalike. In my defense, not even a Disney-prince-smolder delivered by a sweaty sex god is a match for an anxiety-fueled chocolate craving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And had I known before walking into that meeting that my sweaty, sex-god, milk-thief was none other than Christopher Lachlan, the new client on whom my career hung, I’d have definitely skipped my morning stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curse my dumb friggin’ luck. I would be attracted to the one person I can’t have.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can Kit’s super-weird superpower save her world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kit-with-a-small-k is navigating middle school with a really big, really strange secret: When she’s stressed, she turns into a naked mole rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It first happened after kit watched her best friend, Clem, fall and get hurt during an acrobatic performance on TV. Since then, the transformations keep happening—whether kit wants them to or not. Kit can’t tell Clem about it, because after the fall, Clem just hasn’t been herself. She’s sad and mad and gloomy, and keeping a secret of her own: the real reason she fell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A year after the accident, kit and Clem still haven’t figured out how to deal with all the ways they have transformed—both inside and out. When their secrets come between them, the best friends get into a big fight. Somehow, kit has to save the day, but she doesn’t believe she can be that kind of hero. Turning into a naked mole rat isn’t really a superpower. Or is it?   </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shave the princess? Inconceivable! The hilarious bestselling authors of &lt;i&gt;Kill the Farm Boy &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;No Country for Old Gnomes &lt;/i&gt;are back with a new adventure in the irreverent world of Pell.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, a princess slept in a magical tower cloaked in thorns and roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she woke, she found no Prince Charming, only a surfeit of hair and grotesquely long fingernails--which was, honestly, better than some creep who acted without consent. She cut off her long braids and used them to escape. But she kept the beard because it made a great disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a story about finding true love's kiss--it's a story about finding yourself. On a pirate ship. Where you belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are no ordinary pirates aboard &lt;i&gt;The Puffy Peach&lt;/i&gt;, serving under Filthy Lucre, the one-eyed parrot pirate captain. First there's Vic, a swole and misogynistic centaur on a mission to expunge himself of the magic that causes him to conjure tea and dainty cupcakes in response to stress. Then there's Tempest, who's determined to become the first dryad lawyer--preferably before she takes her ultimate form as a man-eating tree. They're joined by Alobartalus, an awkward and unelfly elf who longs to meet his hero, the Sn'archivist who is said to take dictation directly from the gods of Pell. Throw in some mystery meat and a dastardly capitalist plot, and you've got one Pell of an adventure on the high seas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this new escapade set in the magical land of Pell, Delilah S. Dawson and Kevin Hearne lovingly skewer the tropes of fairy tales and create a new kind of fantasy: generous, gently humorous, and inclusive. There might also be otters.</description>

  <description>Honey Holbrook is trying hard to leave her past behind her and make a new life for herself. A former spoiled, rich, wild child, her attention-grabbing antics were tabloid fodder for years. Now she has a new job, a new home, and is staying out of the limelight. But the first day of the new job doesn’t go like she expects when her boss and coworkers make it clear she’s not wanted there, and the first project she has to work on is with pro hockey player Matt Heller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt and Honey had a wild and wicked fling eight years ago when he was attending summer development camp for the California Condors – the NHL team Honey’s dad owns. But the relationship ended when they argued over the loser friends Honey hung around with and Matt had to return to college hockey. Before he left, Matt talked to Honey’s dad about Honey’s exploits. She felt betrayed and rejected, and threw herself even harder into her partying lifestyle while Matt tried to carve out a career for himself in the NHL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Matt’s back with the Condors but recovering from a serious injury that has changed his whole outlook on life.

  <description>The Heller brothers are all heading home for the holidays in their short break in the hockey season. It should be a great family reunion since three of the four brothers are bringing their new girlfriends. But Jase and Remi just got the results of an important DNA test, and neither of them is in a mood to celebrate. Tag and Kyla also just got some surprising news that has them at odds, and Nicole’s nervous about meeting the whole family when she and Logan have been together such a short time. Instead of peace and joy, this holiday is full of angst, worry and tension...is love really enough to overcome all obstacles?</description>

  <description>After her ex trashes her reputation in front of the media and it quickly goes viral, Nicole vows she'll never get involved with another hockey player. Too bad her job with the Minneapolis Caribou puts her in contact with sexy hockey players on a daily basis, including the newly traded center, Logan Heller. Logan's pretty sure Nicole is the perfect woman for him and he's determined to have her-in and out of bed. Nicole is equally determined to never date another hockey player. But Logan has a one-man advantage...he knows what she really wants.</description>

  <description>Kyla has tried so hard to be one of the boys. She was always like a little sister to Tag. One summer, things changed from sibling teasing to blazing sexual tension. When they’re reunited for a two-family reunion, the desire and lust are still there, simmering below the surface. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tag is a pro hockey player who is cynical about women. He knows they’re only interested in him because of who he is. Kyla is an attorney who’s still trying to be “one of the boys” at her law firm. They’re both adults and neither of them is looking for a relationship. A hot summer week at the lake. Need. Attraction. There’s no reason they shouldn’t explore each other.</description>

  <description>Jason and Remi want the same thing—no-strings-attached, screw-their-brains-out, burn-the-sheets-up fun. Pro hockey player Jason just broke up with his girlfriend because she got too serious. Schoolteacher Remi just saw the last of the younger siblings she raised leave the nest. Jace isn’t ready for responsibility. Remi’s had enough responsibility. They’re perfect playmates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fun and sexy games get complicated when emotions get involved. Then responsibility and commitment crash the party when Jason’s past comes back to haunt him. Like it or not, Jason and Remi both have to figure out what they really want.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since I’ve seen her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years since Gabriella James damn near destroyed me with her betrayal, sending me to hell in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve crawled free, escaped the mob, opened a night club, and continue to battle my demons through underground fighting and sex. But now Gabriella’s back, begging for absolution, wanting my forgiveness. All I want is what she’s denied me for all these years—her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex. That’s all we’ll ever have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Gabriella is still keeping secrets. I see it in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t trust her, and I’ll never forgive her betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that won’t stop me from taking her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over…and over…and over…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Lick series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br /&gt;Series Order:&lt;br /&gt;Book #1 Only for a Night&lt;br /&gt;Book #2 Only For Your Touch&lt;br /&gt;Book #3 Only For You&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Nighthawks are hockey’s new expansion team. They’re ice hot. And they’re all about the chase.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Christian:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; They call me a hockey god because I’m a beast on the ice . . . and off. Men want to be me and women just want me. But now that the New York Nighthawks expect me to lead their team to victory, it’s all work and no play. My eyes are on the prize. Until I meet Serena Ellis, a sexy, curvalicious blonde who doesn’t know me from jack. And just like that, I’m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Serena:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; I don’t do one-night stands—especially with celebrity jocks who date models. Lots of models. But the god of hockey is a temptation that’s hard for mere mortals to resist. And after the best kiss of my life, I’m ready to throw my one-night stand rule out the window. Except Christian Chase won’t let me. He doesn’t want a one-night stand. He wants it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The Boston press calls her the Mob Princess. I call her trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discretion is my business, and the reporters dogging her every step are bad news. She’s looking to rebel, to tarnish her naïve “good girl” image by getting dirty with me. I gave up a career as a thief, but Corrine Salvaggi’s wide eyes and sinful mouth damn near begs me to steal her innocence. To corrupt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for her, I deal in sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your fantasy, I deliver. Voyeurism. Threesomes. A little slap and tickle.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it’s your kink, I can fulfill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, life is good. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she enters my club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just sex. Our little secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now...</description>

  <description>Rion Ward fought hard to be free of the Irish mob life. Now, as the co-owner of Boston’s hottest aphrodisiac club, he’s traded crime for the ultimate sexual fantasy. But when the “good girl” from his past walks through Lick’s doors, he discovers that his unconsummated hunger for her never abated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Widowed for two years from a man who felt that anything besides the missionary position was dirty, Harper Shaw is ready to move on. The first step to feeling alive again is sex. Hot, dirty, black-out-from-orgasm sex. And who better to provide it than the brooding, sexy, tatted bad boy-turned-man she’s known for years? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rion, however, has one stipulation: He’ll be hers only for one night. One night to explore her every fantasy. One night to push her limits. One night to introduce her to a passion that makes both doubt if it will be enough…</description>

  <description>When Caleb Gray heads to the Texas coast to mentally prepare for a future he isn’t sure he wants, the last person he expects to see is Catie Dixon. Yeah, their mothers have been planning their wedding since they were born, but he and Catie are most definitely not friends. He can’t see her as anything but the annoying kid who followed him everywhere. Except, it’s really bothering him that everyone is staring at her in that bikini…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catie got over her crush on Caleb ages ago. So why can’t she see past his ripped body or how unsettled he seems? She’s got her own problems, though. Her future has been set for years and now she’s dreaming of pulling the plug. A week at their families’ beach house is just what she needs to pull herself together, and she has no intention of letting Caleb back into her heart...which would be a whole lot easier if he’d put on a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a forced week of togetherness full of beach parties, waterslide mishaps, bonfires, and roller coasters sparks more than an understanding. What do you do when the person standing in the way of your future is the one person you grew up hating...but now don’t?</description>

  <description>I never in a million years thought that finding a lost pair of keys would lead to adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I’ve been perfectly average. Compared to the rest of my high-achieving, type-A family, it feels impossible to stand out. While I’d love to make my big artistic dreams happen, I’m kind of stuck, thanks to a bunch of lame things like “affordable rent” and “keeping the internet on.” Dreaming doesn’t pay the bills. Freelance design work and part-time rideshare driving does. And it’s nice, for the most part. Finding a passenger’s thumb drive usually means reporting, returning, yay-hurrah-good-job-me. Except this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I put the thumb drive in my computer. Hey, I’m just trying to be helpful! Suddenly a chat window pops up and the owner of the drive is bribing me to fly halfway across the world. Today. Turns out he's the super hot fare I haven't been able to stop thinking about...who just so happens to be Logan Weiss—the crazy-hot 29-year-old billionaire known as "the most eligible bachelor in tech”. What the hell am I even doing?</description>

  <description>Emily Birmingham has had it up to &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; with men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up with an overbearing father and then her brother inherits everything she’s worked her whole life to build. Now she’s living in her grandmother's dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere Canada, jobless, and dealing with the most annoyingly sexy contractor on the planet. Exactly when did her life become an anti-Hallmark movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooper Merrick learned the hard way that love is definitely not worth the risk. He’s happy running the family contracting business alongside his well-meaning but overly-opinionated brothers...happy enough until polished and perfect Emily enters his world. Nothing prepared him for the ways she turns his life upside down and reaches the parts of himself he’s closed off from the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he finally gets up the nerve to ask Emily out, she says her next date will need to come with a written contract and some very particular ground rules. Yeah, it sounds crazy, but why does he find himself wanting to sign on the dotted line?</description>

  <description>When a beautiful brunette driver meets Nashville Slammers catcher, Sawyer McBain, at the airport, he figures it's his lucky day. Sure, he's usually pretty guarded around people, especially after what happened with his ex, but he can definitely enjoy the car ride. Until she passes his apartment...and keeps driving. All of a sudden the woman seems a lot less like romance material and a lot more like a &lt;i&gt;kidnapper&lt;/i&gt;. What gives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slammers executive Addison Carlisle needs one little favor. Sure, she may have kinda maybe kidnapped one of her professional baseball players, but it’s for a &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; good cause. She desperately needs someone high-profile to auction off that night for the multiple sclerosis society she’s chairing, but he insists he wants a favor in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Addie and Sawyer are trading completely ridiculous I.O.U.s, like being his plus-one to his grandmother's poker game or keeping each other company at the driving range. But when their agreement goes from flirty to fiery, neither is ready to let their guard down for a shot at love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the For Love of the Game series is STANDALONE:&lt;br /&gt;* Covering All the Bases&lt;br /&gt;* Catching Her Heart</description>

  <description>Nicole DaSilva keeps her mind on the future. That’s where her perfect life is. At least it will be if she can sort out her broken engagement, get her tattoo removed, control her wayward sisters and catch the person stealing from their business…but that’s easier said than done. Especially when there’s a huge, strangely attractive tattooist in her way... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Newcomb keeps his mind on the past. It’s where the demons come loose. He trusts no one and his only plans are for a vasectomy. He and Nicole make as much sense together as, well, an ex-con and a former school captain, but he's never been one to turn down a rebound thing. Especially not with a girl as Type A hot as her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's your standard ‘say anything to my sisters and I'll call the Australian Tax Office and tell them there's $500,000 in cash under your bed' affair, but as Nicole and Noah hook up it's clear they’re falling for each other. Can they meet in the present? Do they have a shot at something steady?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hockey’s resident bad boy is hell on skates. But when he falls in love, he falls hard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Tracy Goodwin is an author to watch.”—Kelly Jamieson, &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the Aces Hockey series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nick:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; As one of the New York Nighthawks, I’ve got it all: fame, success, wealth, plus I’m handsome as hell.&lt;br /&gt; As for my relationships? They could be better.&lt;br /&gt; I know how to do one-night stands, but I’m starting to crave something more.&lt;br /&gt; Then I meet Camille Benetti.&lt;br /&gt; She’s sexy, smart, sarcastic—totally my kind of girl.&lt;br /&gt; The only problem? Cami doesn’t date hockey players.&lt;br /&gt; But she’s never met &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Cami:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; Nick George is impossible to resist. Not only is he scorching hot, he’s kind, he’s funny, and he wants me bad.&lt;br /&gt; But I learned my lesson the hard way: no jocks.&lt;br /&gt; So why do I agree to be Nick’s date to the wedding of the year?&lt;br /&gt; One night . . . that’s our deal.&lt;br /&gt; He is the best man, after all.&lt;br /&gt; But Nick is crystal clear about his intentions. He wants a relationship.&lt;br /&gt; And he’s tempting me to break all my rules. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tracy Goodwin’s seductive New York Nighthawks novels can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;ICE HOT • ICE HARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>It was only meant to be a vacation fling… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three blissful weeks on the beautiful island of Maui are exactly what I need… Hula dancers, Mai Tais with cocktail umbrellas, and golden beaches – what more could I want? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I see &lt;i&gt;her, &lt;/i&gt;and I realize &lt;i&gt;she’s &lt;/i&gt;exactly what I want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was locked outside of her hotel room, all buttoned-up in a suit definitely not appropriate for a vacation, and wearing a fierce take-no-shit stance. But I couldn’t help noticing the pain behind her eyes… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four Mai Tais later, the chemistry between us is hotter than the Hawaiian sun, and we decide to spend the rest of our vacation unwinding, undressing, and getting to know each other a little better… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have just two rules: &lt;br /&gt;1) No talking about our lives outside Maui. &lt;br /&gt;2) This is just a vacation fling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That means I can’t tell her about the heartbreak that haunts me, and the secret I have back home. It means I can’t ask her about the sorrow in her eyes, and why she has such a wall up – a wall I’m determined to bring crashing down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the sun sets on our trip, can I say goodbye to this gorgeous blue-eyed beauty? Or am I going to be tempted to break the rules? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if I do decide to be a rule-breaker, will she even want me when she finds out who I really am? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a full-length, standalone romance with some hot-under-the-collar action, no cheating and a guaranteed HEA. For fans of R.S Grey, Whitney G. and Vi Keeland,&lt;i&gt; Accidental Lies &lt;/i&gt;features a hot AF alpha and a sizzling will-they-wont-they love story that will have you totally addicted!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Sometimes you fall for Mr. Right. And sometimes for Mr. Right Now…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May&lt;br /&gt;Did you hear the one about the girl who walks into a bar and catches her live-in lover kissing someone else? No? You’re the only one in town who missed it.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Alec is there to wrap me up in strong arms and carry me out the door before things get too ugly. And that’s not all Alec is good at. Our unexpected chemistry makes him the perfect rebound guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alec&lt;br /&gt;I should know better than to hook up with my rival’s little sister, but the fiery look in May’s eyes really turns my crank. She needs cheering up, and I’m just the guy for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’ll fall in love. Not even after a string of scorching hot trysts, and the realization that we’re good at the same things: wild nights and familial disappointment. I don’t do love, never have, never will. So this is the perfect arrangement, for both of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody would approve, but nobody has to know…</description>

  <description>There's a first time for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lark Wainwright used to be fearless. Her life was a series of adventures, each one more exhilarating than the last. But her recent overseas adventure was one too many. Now she’s home and in one piece. Mostly. But her nights are filled with terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend offers her a stay at the orchard in exchange for help at the farmers’ markets, Lark jumps at the chance to spend fall in Vermont. But her nightmares don’t stop. Desperate to keep her fragile state a secret, she relies on the most soft-spoken resident of the Shipley Farm to soothe her when her dreams prove too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zachariah is a survivor, too. It’s been four years since he was tossed aside by the polygamist cult where he grew up. He’s found a peaceful existence on the Shipley’s farm, picking apples and fixing machinery. But getting thrown away by your own people at nineteen leaves a mark on a guy. He doesn’t always know what to make of a world where movie quotes are the primary means of communication. Before hitchhiking to Vermont, he’d never watched TV or spoken on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there are a lot of things he’s never done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach and Lark slowly grow to trust one another. One night they become even closer than they’d planned. But Lark may still be too broken to trust anyone. When she pushes Zach away, he will have to prove to himself that he's good for much more than farm labor.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It’s all in the chemistry…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sisters Sarah and Molly are close, but they couldn’t be more different. Sarah runs a craft business and is obsessed with all things shiny and glam, whilst Molly is much more at home in her white coat and goggles, working in a science lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Molly is put onto a new assignment, she’s over the moon. It’s a high-profile, top secret project – and she has a handsome new boss to ogle at when she’s not bending over a petri dish…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Sarah finds herself on the painful end of a disastrous break-up, no amount of Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s or trashy rom-coms can cheer her up. She wants to take a more drastic approach to dealing with her heartbreak, and one that only her sister – and perhaps a sprinkle of science – can help with . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will Sarah find love where she least expects it, or is it really all in the chemistry?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She wants a fake relationship. He needs something real.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing Rae can’t stand, it’s pity. She’s forty, frazzled, and fed up—so attending an awards ceremony &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt; while her ex swans about with his new wife? Not an option. To avoid total humiliation, Rae needs a date of her own. And her young, hot-as-hell new best friend is the perfect candidate…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach Davis, king of casual hookups, has a secret: the notorious womaniser craves emotional connection, and anonymous encounters leave him feeling hollow. After years of performance, Zach’s desperate to be himself. So why does he agree to play Rae’s fake boyfriend? And why does it feel so easy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the line between pretence and desire blurs, Zach’s forced to face an unexpected truth: there’s nothing phoney about his need for Rae. But the jaded divorcée’s been hurt by playboy men before. Can a weekend of faking it prove that Zach’s for real?</description>

  <description>When it comes to sex, good girl Skyler Thompson always plays it safe, choosing stable and sedate over wild and thrilling. She doesn’t do one-night-stands, but one look at sinfully sexy Gage Holt and she’s willing to reconsider. He makes her want to be &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; for once in her life, and she’s prepared to take what she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger follows former MMA fighter Gage Holt like a shadow. Despite his successes as part owner of Sin, an exclusive nightclub in Boston, Gage can’t risk getting involved with a woman, especially one as sweet as Skyler. Still, he can’t resist a taste—and it’s so damn good he has to see her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As addicted as he is to her, Gage knows there’s no future for him and Skyler—not with his past lurking in the dark corners of an MMA cage. But Skyler’s tougher than she looks, and she’s ready to fight for her man.</description>

  <description>After a young woman is kidnapped by an evil Faerie Queen and trapped in a far off realm, she must survive teen Victorian fairy fight club in order to get back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the illegitimate daughter of a Naval Captain, Artemisia has never fit in with her father’s family, nor the high class world to which they belong. However, when she is targeted by the Faerie Queen and pulled into another realm, she has no choice but to fight her way back home, amongst evil fairies who want her head, and untrustworthy allies that claim solidarity but have ulterior motives. New York Times bestselling author Delilah S. Dawson (Ladycastle, Star Wars: Phasma) and illustrator Matias Basla (The Claw and Fang) present a gripping dark fantasy tale of a young woman claiming her time and her agency.</description>

  <description>Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>I've never been so stupid in my entire life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elise Parrish, my teammate's incredibly sweet and gorgeous younger sister should have been off-limits, but my hockey stick didn't get that memo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After our team won the championship game, and plenty of alcohol, our flirting turned physical and I took her to bed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I knew it was wrong to punch her V-card, but when I mess up, I’m apparently a &lt;i&gt;go big or go home&lt;/i&gt; kind of guy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shame sent her running the next morning from our catastrophic mistake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I don't remember that night—but every detail is burned into my brain so deeply, I’ll never forget. The feel of her in my arms, the soft whimpers of pleasure I coaxed from her perfect lips… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And now I’ve spent six months trying to get her out of my head. Which has been futile, because I’m starting to understand she’s the only girl I’ll ever want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have one shot to show her I can be exactly what she needs, but Elise won’t be easily convinced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s okay, because I’m good under pressure, and this time, I’m playing for keeps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get ready to meet your new favorite hot jocks in an all new series of stand-alone novels. If you like sexy, confident men who know how to handle a stick (on and off the ice), and smart women who are strong enough to keep all those big egos in check, this series of athlete romances is perfect for you! &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The wrong man never felt so right...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-fighter Reed Miller has been secretly lusting over his best friend’s girl for months, but he refuses to jeopardize a friendship over a woman—especially one who doesn’t like him all that much. Now that Darcy’s on the market again, it’s even more imperative to stick to his strict hands-off policy. But the sizzling attraction between them is too powerful to ignore, and once he’s had a taste of her…all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcy Grant is tired of walking the straight and narrow path. She’s on the hunt for passion, and there’s no denying Reed is just the man to give it to her. Although she has no interest in dating a bad boy, and certainly not her ex’s best friend, it’s impossible not to melt beneath Reed’s skillful touch. Now it’s just a matter of setting a few ground rules—and hoping her rule-breaking, sweet-talking bad boy agrees to follow them. But if she lets Reed into her bed, does she stand a chance of keeping him out of her heart?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sabrina the Teenage Witch &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;Roller Girl &lt;/i&gt;in this hilarious, one-of-a-kind graphic novel about a half-witch who has just discovered the truth about herself, her family, and her town and is doing her best to survive middle school now that she knows everything!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic is harder than it looks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Moth Hush loves all things witchy. But she’s about to discover that witches aren’t just the stuff of movies, books, and spooky stories. When some eighth-grade bullies try to ruin her Halloween, something really strange happens. It turns out that Founder’s Bluff, Massachusetts, has a centuries-old history of witch drama. And, surprise: Moth’s family is at the center of it all! When Moth’s new powers show up, things get totally out-of-control. She meets a talking cat, falls into an enchanted diary, and unlocks a hidden witch world. Secrets surface from generations past as Moth unravels the complicated legacy at the heart of her town, her family, and herself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this spellbinding graphic novel debut, Emma Steinkellner spins a story packed with humor and heart about the weird and wonderful adventures of a witch-in-progress.</description>

  <description>A story of love and demons, family and witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova Huang knows more about magic than your average teen witch. She works at her grandmothers' bookshop, where she helps them loan out spell books and investigate any supernatural occurrences in their New England town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fateful night, she follows reports of a white wolf into the woods, and she comes across the unexpected: her childhood crush, Tam Lang, battling a horse demon in the woods. As a werewolf, Tam has been wandering from place to place for years, unable to call any town home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by dark forces eager to claim the magic of wolves and out of options, Tam turns to Nova for help. Their latent feelings are rekindled against the backdrop of witchcraft, untested magic, occult rituals, and family ties both new and old in this enchanting tale of self-discovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A party girl and a clean-cut college hockey player discover that they’re not so different in this sexy, soulful Bayard Hockey novel from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Shut Out &lt;/i&gt;and the Heller Brothers series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ella Verran has three goals this semester: get off academic probation, repair her relationship with her friend Skylar, and take some responsibility for her life. All of which are hard enough without hot, snobby hockey player Ben Buckingham around to distract her. Ella can’t stand Ben, and she knows the feeling is mutual. But he’s best friends with Skylar’s boyfriend, so he’s always around—taunting and tempting Ella in ways she never thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the star forward of the Bayard College hockey team, Ben has goals too, like playing well enough to land a spot on an NHL roster. Ben is perfectly poised on the ice, so why can’t he keep his cool around Ella? Her wild behavior rubs him in all the wrong ways—and a few of the right ones. But as they skate around each other, Ben learns that there’s more to Ella than her bad reputation. And when the line between love and hate starts to blur, he can’t resist crossing over and sweeping her off her feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is my go-to author for hockey romance.”—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jami Davenport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Aces Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;MAJOR MISCONDUCT | OFF LIMITS | ICING | TOP SHELF | BACK CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone hockey romance: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And don’t miss her Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A flirty standalone novel* from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One night with him will change her life...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between her waitressing job, volunteer work, and college classes, there are never enough hours in Maggie Reilly’s day. Especially not for a relationship. Luckily, she’s got the perfect arrangement: a lover she meets three or four times a year. But when she shows up at the hotel expecting to hop into bed with one man, she accidentally ends up with another—Ben Barrett, Hollywood’s most notorious bad boy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ben, determined to lay low after another scandal, just wants some much-needed sleep. What he gets is a scorching make-out session with a gorgeous, naked redhead. He won’t accept her apology, but what he will accept is a place to hide out…and if there’s some hot, no-strings sex involved, why the heck not? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Ben soon discovers that one week with his sassy, bed-hopping waitress is definitely not enough. He wants more. A lot more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now he needs to convince relationship-averse Maggie that a bad boy might be oh so good for her—and the best thing that’s ever happened to both of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;* Previously published in 2008, Bad Apple (formerly Midnight Encounters) features almost entirely new content, including a point-of-view switch. Enjoy this new version of an old favorite!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>No last names. No life stories. Those were the rules. Now a USA Today bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time a cocky, copper-haired tourist sauntered into Zara’s bar. And even though she knew better, Zara indulged in a cure for the small-town blues. It was supposed to be an uncomplicated fling—a few sizzling weeks before he went back to his life, and she moved on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until an accidental pregnancy changed her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, she’s made peace with the notion that Dave From Brooklyn will never be found. Until one summer day when he walks into her coffee shop, leveling her with the same hot smile that always renders her defenseless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey star Dave Beringer has never forgotten the intense month he spent with prickly Zara. Their nights together were the first true intimacy he’d ever experienced. But the discovery of his child is the shock of a lifetime, and his ugly past puts relationships and family out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does it? Vermont’s countryside has a way of nurturing even tortured souls. The fields and the orchards—and hard won love—are Bountiful.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The new face of big evil is a little . . . small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Dastardly deeds aren’t exactly the first things that come to mind when one hears the name “Clementine,” but as the sole heir of the infamous Dark Lord Elithor, twelve-year-old Clementine Morcerous has been groomed since birth to be the best (worst?) Evil Overlord she can be. But everything changes the day the Dark Lord Elithor is cursed by a mysterious rival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, Clementine must not only search for a way to break the curse, but also take on the full responsibilities of the Dark Lord. As Clementine forms her first friendships, discovers more about her own magic than she ever dared to explore, and is called upon to break her father’s code of good and evil, she starts to question the very life she’s been fighting for. What if the Dark Lord Clementine doesn’t want to be dark after all?&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Two teens meet after tragedy and learn about love, loss, and letting go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naima Rodriguez doesn’t want your patronizing sympathy as she grieves her father, her hero—a fallen Marine. She’ll hate you forever if you ask her to open up and remember him “as he was,” though that’s all her loving family wants her to do in order to manage her complex OCD and GAD. She’d rather everyone back the-eff off while she separates her Lucky Charms marshmallows into six, always six, Ziploc bags, while she avoids friends and people and living the life her father so desperately wanted for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dew respectfully requests a little more time to process the sudden loss of his parents. It's causing an avalanche of secret anxieties, so he counts on his trusty voice recorder to convey the things he can’t otherwise say aloud. He could really use a friend to navigate a life swimming with pain and loss and all the lovely moments in between. And then he meets Naima and everything’s changed—just not in the way he, or she, expects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candace Ganger's &lt;i&gt;Six Goodbyes We Never Said&lt;/i&gt; is no love story. If you ask Naima, it’s not even a like story. But it is a story about love and fear and how sometimes you need a little help to be brave enough to say goodbye.</description>

  <description>Prudence Carlson has been lucky in life. A fulfilling wedding-planning business run with her girlfriends in Colorado, plus the best guy friend ever in her firefighter bestie Finn. All that’s missing from it is a baby. Luckily, it’s the twenty-first century—Pru can take matters into her own hands. She doesn’t need to find true love to create the future love of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except all this talk of babies and insemination and...Pru and Finn cross a line they never expected to. Sure, one night of passion won’t change their close friendship. Until Pru goes in for a fertility check-up to find… she’s already pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As best friends, Pru and Finn have survived college, new jobs, and bad breakups, but can they survive crib shopping, birth classes, and late-night cravings? Especially when Finn has never considered himself even remotely Daddy material?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She learns the ways of the fiercely loyal, but undeniably dangerous Vikings&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Torunn the Strong and her sisters, the descendants of the Goddess Solveig of Highgard are the only survivors of the dreaded Red Death. Tall, blonde, beautiful, brave and skilled in weaponry, Torunn will do whatever is necessary to save them from the scourge that killed their people. Forced to leave her sisters and her world behind, she is transported to the land of the Vikings where she is to discover the fate of the lost Highgardian boys sent there twenty years earlier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Near death, she is saved by Brandr, a fearless, tall, muscular, ruggedly handsome man once a Viking warrior. Torunn and Brandr are forced to battle the brutal mountainous climate, wild beasts, and dangerous enemies. Neither want to admit they are falling deeply in love, for Torunn hasn’t ever met a man before and Brandr’s past is filled with tragedy and betrayal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it possible for them to find happiness together?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s a player in more ways than one…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College junior John Logan can get any girl he wants. For this hockey star, life is a parade of parties and hook-ups, but behind his killer grins and easygoing charm, he hides growing despair about the dead-end road he’ll be forced to walk after graduation. A sexy encounter with freshman Grace Ivers is just the distraction he needs, but when a thoughtless mistake pushes her away, Logan plans to spend his final year proving to her that he’s worth a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now he’s going to need to up his game…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a less than stellar freshman year, Grace is back at Briar University, older, wiser, and &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; over the arrogant hockey player she nearly handed her V-card to. She’s not a charity case, and she’s not the quiet butterfly she was when they first hooked up. If Logan expects her to roll over and beg like all his other puck bunnies, he can think again. He wants her back? He’ll have to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; for it. This time around, she’ll be the one in the driver’s seat…and she plans on driving him wild.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s good at achieving her goals…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College senior Sabrina James has her whole future planned out: graduate from college, kick butt in law school, and land a high-paying job at a cutthroat firm. Her path to escaping her shameful past certainly doesn’t include a gorgeous hockey player who believes in love at first sight. One night of sizzling heat and surprising tenderness is all she’s willing to give John Tucker, but sometimes, one night is all it takes for your entire life to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the game just got a whole lot more complicated...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucker believes being a team player is as important as being the star. On the ice, he’s fine staying out of the spotlight, but when it comes to becoming a daddy at the age of twenty-two, he refuses to be a bench warmer. It doesn’t hurt that the soon-to-be mother of his child is beautiful, whip-smart, and keeps him on his toes. The problem is, Sabrina’s heart is locked up tight, and the fiery brunette is too stubborn to accept his help. If he wants a life with the woman of his dreams, he’ll have to convince her that some goals can only be made with an assist.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The new series is set in Vermont. True North is populated by the tough, outdoorsy mountain men that populate the Green Mountain State. They raise cows and they grow apples. They chop a lot of wood, especially when they need to blow off steam. (Beards are optional but encouraged.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the orchard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person Griffin Shipley expects to find stuck in a ditch on his Vermont country road is his ex-hookup. Five years ago they’d shared a couple of steamy nights together. But that was a lifetime ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-seven, Griff is now the accidental patriarch of his family farm. Even his enormous shoulders feel the strain of supporting his mother, three siblings and a dotty grandfather. He doesn’t have time for the sorority girl who’s shown up expecting to buy his harvest at half price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vermont was never in Audrey Kidder’s travel plans. Neither was Griff Shipley. But she needs a second chance with the restaurant conglomerate employing her. Okay—a fifth chance. And no self-righteous lumbersexual farmer will stand in her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re adversaries. They want entirely different things from life. Too bad their sexual chemistry is as hot as Audrey’s top secret enchilada sauce, and then some.</description>

  <description>He knows how to score, on and off the ice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won’t include the king of one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’ll take more than flashy moves to win her over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls…he’s a ladies man, all right, and he’s yet to meet a woman who’s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world—and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It’s not over until he says it’s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's a Special Forces veteran making his pro hockey debut. She's a dogged sports reporter determined to get a scoop. She's also his best friend's widow...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans can’t get enough of Levi Hunt, the Special Forces veteran who put his NHL career on hold to serve his country and fight the bad guys. So when his new Chicago Rebels bosses tell him to cooperate with the press on a profile, he’s ready to do his duty. Until he finds out who he has to work with: flame-haired, freckle-splashed, impossibly perky Jordan Cooke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman he should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have kissed the night she buried her husband, Levi’s best friend in the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey-stick-up-his-butt-serious Levi Hunt might despise Jordan for reasons she can’t fathom—okay, it’s to do with kissing—but her future in the cutthroat world of sports reporting hangs on delivering the goods on the league’s hottest, grumpiest rookie. So what if he’s not interested in having his life plated up for public consumption. Too bad. Jordan will have to play dirty to get her scoop and even dirtier to get her man. Only in winning the story, she might just lose her heart...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows the girl is off limits. But it's so good to be bad. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this girl...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi and I have been trading hungry looks all year, and everything she does makes me smile. But I don't do girlfriends, and I certainly can't get involved with the league commissioner's daughter. I need shots on goal, not a hookup and a widely misunderstood paparazzi photo.&lt;br /&gt;Can I resist her, though? The way she teases me should be a game penalty for interference with my libido.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this guy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason wants me, but he won't admit it. That man looks at me the way a hockey player eyes the lunch buffet after practice--and I love it. &lt;br /&gt;But when victory is finally within my grasp, I blow it and humiliate myself. Even then I can't even avoid him--as the team intern, I'm in constant view of his hard body and cocky smile. &lt;br /&gt;I need another chance. Jason Castro is about to learn the true meaning of an overnight sensation.</description>

  <description>“By turns heartbreaking and laugh-out-loud funny.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Kristin Rockaway, author of &lt;em&gt;How To Hack a Heartbreak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sensitive, thoughtful, and touching.” —&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A young widow must face the grief she’s always set aside when an unexpected delivery throws her life into disarray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Charlotte Rosen has a secret: she’s a widow. Ever since the fateful day that leveled her world, Charlotte has worked hard to move forward. Great job at a hot social media analytics company? Check. Roommate with no knowledge of her past? Check. Adorable dog? Check. All the while, she’s faithfully data-crunched her way through life, calculating the probability of risk—so she can avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Charlotte’s algorithms could never have predicted that her late husband’s ashes would land squarely on her doorstep five years later. Stunned but determined, Charlotte sets out to find meaning in this sudden twist of fate, even if that includes facing her perfectly coiffed, and perfectly difficult, ex-mother-in-law—and her husband’s best friend, who seems to become a fixture at her side whether she likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her quest reveals a shocking secret, Charlotte is forced to answer questions she never knew to ask and to consider the possibility of forgiveness. And when a chance at a new life arises, she’ll have to decide once and for all whether to follow the numbers or trust her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this Brooklyn Bruisers romance, a hockey goalie has to trust his instincts, even when taking a shot to the heart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Beacon is a champion at defending the net, but off the ice, he's not so lucky. A widower and a single father, he's never forgotten Lauren Williams, the ex who gave him the best year of his life. When Lauren reappears in the Bruisers' office during the play-offs, Beacon sees his chance to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren hates that she's forced to travel with the team she used to work for and the man who broke her heart. There's still undeniable sexual tension running between her and Mike, but she won't go down that road again. She's focused on her plans for the future--she doesn't need a man to make her dreams of motherhood come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren plays her best defensive game, but she's no match for the dark-eyed goalie. When the field of play moves to Florida, things heat up on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Mike's biggest fans doesn't approve--his teenage daughter. But a true competitor knows not to waste the perfect shot at love.</description>

  <description>Rinn has grown up with the Tea Dragons that inhabit their village, but stumbling across a real dragon turns out to be a different matter entirely! Aedhan is a young dragon who was appointed to protect the village but fell asleep in the forest eighty years ago. With the aid of Rinn’s adventuring uncle Erik and his partner Hesekiel, they investigate the mystery of his enchanted sleep, but Rinn’s real challenge is to help Aedhan come to terms with feeling that he cannot get back the time he has lost.</description>

  <description>William MacGregor will lie, spy, and happily die to protect his clan from their greatest enemy. But when he kidnaps the wrong woman, he triggers the very events he’d been working so hard to prevent. And puts everyone in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Thatcher will do anything to protect her lady and return them both safely to English soil. But the damn Highlander who snatched her off the docks has done nothing but get in her way. She’d love to ditch the bastard, but if they want to save their respective loved ones, they are going to have to stay together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the grueling journey to Scotland, their constant bickering turns into something more. Something worth fighting for. But how can an English lady’s maid, who longs for the safe, comfortable life she had in London, find love with a Highlander who can’t wait to wipe England’s dust off his feet? If they can’t defeat the enemy they accidentally led home, they might not live long enough to find out.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Don’t touch the nanny. It’s one rule I’m most certainly going to break.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since becoming a single father, I have two things that keep me sane—my daughter Lily and playing football for the NFL. But when my meddling sister hires a nanny without my knowledge, I’m not thrilled to come home and find the woman has taken over my house. Our instant attraction is one more complication I don’t need in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my daughter loves Amelia, and I will do anything for that tiny munchkin. Even if it means walking around with blue balls most of the time. Why does the &lt;i&gt;nanny&lt;/i&gt; have to be so sweet—and drop dead gorgeous? She’s driving me crazy. Never in my life have I wanted a woman more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need to make it through this season. I can do that. Hands free, of course. But then there’s that moment, and I know she’s thinking what I’m thinking and, well, yeah. Screw the rules...</description>

  <description>I may know everything there is to know about baseball, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Or like him. Garrett Reeves: sidelined player and the embodiment of everything I’ve learned to hate about baseball. He’s gorgeous, he’s cocky, he’s laser-focused on getting back in the game, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he convinces me to call games alongside him, our chemistry heats up the booth. We’re good together, whether I want to admit it or not. I’m finding that I like baseball again, but even worse, I’m liking Garrett. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he has to decide between our future and a new shot at his dreams, I know baseball will win out every time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book has tons of hilarious banter, lots of sexual tension, and a hero who will throw a wild pitch right at your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The timeless romance, soaring passion—and gorgeous men—of Scotland comes to modern-day America. And the rules of love will never be the same…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel Buchanan is fiery, funny, and never at a loss for words. But she is struck speechless when her mother returns from a trip to Scotland with a six-foot-tall, very handsome souvenir. Izzy’s mother is so infatuated by the fellow that Izzy has to plan their annual Highland Games all by herself. Well, not completely by herself. The Highlander’s strapping young nephew has come looking for his uncle…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alasdair Blackmoor has never seen a place as friendly as this small Georgia town—or a girl as brilliant and beguiling as Izzy. Instead of saving his uncle, who seems to be having a lovely time, Alasdair decides he’d rather help Izzy with the Highland Games. Show her how to dance like a Highlander. Drink like a Highlander. And maybe, just maybe, fall in love with a Highlander. But when the games are over, where do they go from here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Laura Trentham creates a romance that is both extremely sensual and phenomenal.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Marshall Dyson wants one thing and one thing only: to raze his grandfather’s island to the ground. Everything is ready to go––except for the freakin’ bunnies! Hundreds of the furry critters hopping about and multiplying before his eyes. And then there’s the American Bunny League, along with one distractingly beautiful veterinarian, taking him to court to save them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Augusta “Gus” North can’t believe the grumpy–and annoyingly hot–builder she’s facing in court cares more about demo-ing some cabin than the lives of 200 bunnies. But when the judge orders Marshall to stay on the island and help her rehome the rabbits – the entire month – she knows they’re going to need to lay some ground rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, for example, absolutely no kissing. Might as well go ahead and get that in writing. Sure it’s on a napkin, but that still counts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard could it be to keep their hands off each other amidst all the fighting? Surprisingly, harder than wrangling 200 bunnies...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Soon to be a Netflix original series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lady of the Lake is the true hero in this cinematic twist on the tale of King Arthur created by Thomas Wheeler and legendary artist, producer, and director Frank Miller (300, Batman: The Dark Night Returns, Sin City). Featuring 8 full color and 30 black-and-white pieces of original artwork by Frank Miller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whosoever wields the Sword of Power shall be the one true King.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if the Sword has chosen a Queen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimue grew up an outcast. Her connection to dark magic made her something to be feared in her Druid village, and that made her desperate to leave…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until her entire village is slaughtered by Red Paladins, and Nimue’s fate is forever altered. Charged by her dying mother to reunite an ancient sword with a legendary sorcerer, Nimue is now her people’s only hope. Her mission leaves little room for revenge, but the growing power within her can think of little else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimue teams up with a charming mercenary named Arthur and refugee Fey Folk from across England. She wields a sword meant for the one true king, battling paladins and the armies of a corrupt king. She struggles to unite her people, avenge her family, and discover the truth about her destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps the one thing that can change Destiny itself is found at the edge of a blade.</description>

  <description>After a bet with his brother, Liam O'Connor has to date the next woman who walks into the pub. And he's all in, because his pub is on the line. What he didn't expect was Casey Meadows, who at first glance with her big glasses and bulky sweater looks like a woman who has many, many cats—but her wit and smile make him wonder what's underneath her bulky armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey Meadows aka sweet romance author Cassie O'Brien is about to lose everything. As in, her writing career is going down the drain because she can't write the sexy stuff that's selling these days. She needs inspiration in the worst way. That's when she walks into the wrong pub at the right time. Sexy owner Liam is just what the writing doctor ordered. Her whole body is feeling inspired—and when he makes a proposal she can't refuse—she's all in. Oh, hell yes. Best. Sex. Of. Her. Life. Thanks to Liam, she's about to write a best-seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having an erotic romance alter ego is nothing compared to the real secret Cassie is hiding—and that one could destroy everything.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;He’s a fighter in the rink, but he’s about to learn that playing nice can help you score...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As team captain and enforcer, Patrick O'Doul puts the bruise in the Brooklyn Bruisers. But after years of hard hits, O'Doul is feeling the burn, both physically and mentally. He conceals his pain from his coach and trainers, but when his chronic hip injury becomes too obvious to ignore, they send him for sessions with the team’s massage therapist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After breaking up with her long-term boyfriend, Ari Bettini is in need of peace of mind. For now, she’s decided to focus on her work: rehabilitating the Bruisers’ MVP. O'Doul is easy on the eyes, but his reaction to her touch is ice cold. Ari is determined to help O'Doul heal, but as the tension between them turns red hot, they both learn that a little TLC does the body good...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy new standalone from USA Today bestseller Sarina Bowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d think a billion dollars, a professional hockey team and a six-bedroom mansion on the Promenade would satisfy a guy. You’d be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seven years Rebecca has brightened my office with her wit and her smile. She manages both my hockey team and my sanity. I don’t know when I started waking in the night, craving her. All I know is that one whiff of her perfume ruins my concentration. And her laugh makes me hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rebecca gets hurt, I step in to help. It’s what friends do. But what friends don’t do is rip off each others’ clothes for a single, wild night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s avoiding me. She says we’re too different, and it can never happen again. So why can’t we keep our hands off each other?</description>

  <description>When a tragic accident takes the life of 17-year-old Raven Roth's foster mom—and Raven's memory—she moves to New Orleans to recover and finish her senior year of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over isn't easy. Raven remembers everyday stuff like how to solve math equations and make pasta, but she can't remember her favorite song or who she was before the accident. And when impossible things start happening, Raven begins to think it might even be better not to know who she was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she grows closer to her new friends, her foster sister, Max, and Tommy Torres, a guy who accepts her for who she is now, Raven has to decide if she's ready to face what's buried in the past... and the darkness building inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kami Garcia and first-time graphic novel artist Gabriel Picolo comes this riveting tale of finding the strength to face who you are and learning to trust others—and yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Romance blossoms between two city planners posing as newlyweds in this first in a bright new series by acclaimed author Ruby Lang&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Oliver Huang expects to see on the historic Mount Morris home tour is longtime acquaintance Fay Liu bustling up and kissing him hello. He’s happy to playact being a couple to save her from a pushy admirer. Fay’s beautiful, successful and smart, and if he’s being honest, Oliver has always had a bit of a thing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe more than a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geeking out over architectural details is Oliver and Fay’s shared love language, and soon they’re touring pricey real estate across Upper Manhattan as the terribly faux but terribly charming couple Darling and Olly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since being laid off from the job he loved, Oliver has something to look forward to. And for the first time since her divorce, Fay’s having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere between the light-filled living rooms and spacious closets they’ve explored, this faux relationship just may have sparked some very real feelings. For Oliver and Fay, home truly is where their hearts are.</description>

  <description>Harper Nugent might have a little extra junk in her trunk, but her stepbrother calling her out on it is the last straw… When rugby hottie, Dexter Blake, witnesses the insult, he surprises Harper by asking her out. In front of her dumbass brother. Score! Of course, she knows it’s not for reals, but Dex won’t take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dexter Blake’s life revolves around rugby with one hard and fast rule: no women. Sure, his left hand is getting a workout, but he's focused on his career for now. Then he overhears an asshat reporter belittle the curvy chick he'd been secretly ogling. What's a guy to do but ask her out? It’s just a little revenge against a poser, and then he'll get his head back in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the date is better than either expected. So is the next one. And the next. And the heat between them…sizzles their clothes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, this fake relationship is feeling all too real…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in a sexy new series featuring the hockey players of the Brooklyn Bruisers and the women who win their hearts—from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Ivy Years series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In high school they were the perfect couple—until the day Georgia left Leo in the cold...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hockey player Leo Trevi has spent the last six years trying to do two things: get over the girl who broke his heart, and succeed in the NHL. But on the first day he’s called up to the newly franchised Brooklyn Bruisers, Leo gets checked on both sides, first by the team’s coach—who has a long simmering grudge, and then by the Bruisers’ sexy, icy publicist—his former girlfriend Georgia Worthington.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Saying goodbye to Leo was one of the hardest things Georgia ever had to do—and saying hello again isn’t much easier. Georgia is determined to keep their relationship strictly professional, but when a press conference microphone catches Leo declaring his feelings for her, things get really personal, really fast....</description>

  <description>How exactly has one good deed landed me in the penalty box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice Knights defenseman Zach Blackburn has come down with the flu, and my BFF—his PR manager—begs me to put my nursing degree to use and get him back to health. Of course she would call in a favor for the most hated man in Harbor City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he’s finally on the mend and I’m sneaking out of his place, everything goes sideways. Paparazzi spot me and pictures, plus accusations that I slept with him, fly faster than a hockey puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, all of Harbor City wants my blood—or to give me a girlie-girl makeover. But then…the team finally wins a game. And now this fickle town wants me with the big jerk twenty-four seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argh. I never slept with him the first time! But no one will listen. Then the grumpy bastard goes and promises to break his no-fan-appearances rule to help raise money for a free health clinic—but only if I’m rink-side at every game. That’s not a deal I can turn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the team keeps winning, and I realize there’s more to him than his bad reputation, suddenly remembering to keep my real hands off my fake date gets harder and harder to do.</description>

  <description>All I want is to play hockey on the Ice Knights, instead, I’m in a viral video for all the wrong reasons and my mom—yes, my mom—has taken over my dating apps. Then, when I think it can’t get any worse, the fates deliver Zara Ambrose, a five-feet-nothing redhead with more freckles than inches and who’d rather be anywhere other than on a date with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a bet with her friends and my PR nightmare have us both stuck in this go-on-five-dates-with-the-same-person hell situation. But if we band together, we can get the whole thing over with and go on with our lives. It’s perfect! No feelings. No future. No fuc— *ahem* fun. No naked fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could go wrong? Nothing—as long as I remember the rules. Don’t notice the way she looks in a dress. Don’t react when she does that little shivery sigh thing whenever we touch. Don’t think about the fact that she’s never had a toe-curling orgasm that wasn’t self-delivered and just how badly I want to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five dates—that’s it—and then we go our separate ways. At least, that was the plan..</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new standalone novel in the Brooklyn Bruisers world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes lady luck shakes your hand, and sometimes she smacks your face. Sometimes she does both on the same day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago I met the most amazing girl in the world. We were both down on our luck. Then I got that call—the one that tells you to get your buns on a plane to go meet your destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the girl was left behind. I didn’t have her phone number, and she didn’t know my real name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I became a professional hockey player, she became a superstar, with platinum records and legions of fans. And a slick, music producer boyfriend who treated her badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate wasn’t done with us yet. When Delilah turns up at a hockey game, I can’t resist making contact. The internet swoons when I ask her out on a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not remember me. But her jerkface ex does. He’ll do anything to keep us apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing athletes never give up. This time I’m playing for keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information at &lt;a href="https://www.sarinabowen.com/brooklynbruisers" rel="nofollow"&gt;SarinaBowen.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36988476-something-so-right" rel="nofollow"&gt;B01JEUUCC2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment everything changed didn’t happen in that cliché rockets-red-glare kind of way, it happened in the form of a waking nightmare. I caught my husband, my high-school sweetheart, the father of my children, balls deep in a sordid affair. &lt;br /&gt;That was when I gave up on men and love. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t count on the NHL’s golden boy, the beautiful, arrogant Cooper Stone turning my life and my hockey rink upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My kids are why I wake up in the morning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hockey is what Cooper breathes for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re from different worlds and places in our lives but when our hearts collided something so wrong and different turned into something so right.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;Love, Simon &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Eleanor and Park&lt;/i&gt;, a romantic and sweet novel about a transgender boy who falls in love for the first time—and how first love changes us all—from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Amber Smith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris and Maia aren’t off to a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A near-fatal car accident first brings them together, and their next encounters don’t fare much better. Chris’s good intentions backfire. Maia’s temper gets the best of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they’re neighbors, at least for the summer, and despite their best efforts, they just can’t seem to stay away from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path forward isn’t easy. Chris has come out as transgender, but he’s still processing a frightening assault he survived the year before. Maia is grieving the loss of her older sister and trying to find her place in the world without her. Falling in love was the last thing on either of their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But would it be so bad if it happened anyway?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From now on I'm Alan of Trebond, the younger twin. I'll be a knight.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so young Alanna of Trebond begins the journey to knighthood. Though a girl, Alanna has always craved the adventure and daring allowed only for boys; her twin brother, Thom, yearns to learn the art of magic. So one day they decide to switch places: Thom heads for the convent to learn magic; Alanna, pretending to be a boy, is on her way to the castle of King Roald to begin her training as a page. &lt;p&gt; But the road to knighthood is not an easy one. As Alanna masters the skills necessary for battle, she must also learn to control her heart and to discern her enemies from her allies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with swords and sorcery, adventure and intrigue, good and evil, Alanna's first adventure begins - one that will lead to the fulfillment of her dreams and the magical destiny that will make her a legend in her land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One thousand years ago, a wish was made to the Harbinger of Change and a sword of rage and lightning was forged. &lt;i&gt;Kamigoroshi.&lt;/i&gt; The Godslayer. It had one task: to seal away the powerful demon Hakaimono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he has broken free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitsune shapeshifter Yumeko has one task: to take her piece of the ancient and powerful scroll to the Steel Feather temple in order to prevent the summoning of the Harbinger of Change, the great Kami Dragon who will grant one wish to whomever holds the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers. But she has a new enemy now. The demon Hakaimono, who for centuries was trapped in a cursed sword, has escaped and possessed the boy she thought would protect her, Kage Tatsumi of the Shadow Clan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hakaimono has done the unthinkable and joined forces with the Master of Demons in order to break the curse of the sword and set himself free. To overthrow the empire and cover the land in darkness, they need one thing: the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers. As the paths of Yumeko and the possessed Tatsumi cross once again, the entire empire will be thrown into chaos.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of the Heller Brothers Hockey series comes the first novel of a new hockey romance series featuring a college team whose players are heating things up both on and off the ice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard College hockey team isn’t where Jacob Flass thought he’d be a season ago. He was a rising star in the Canadian major junior league, cruising toward a spot on an NHL roster—until a single disastrous night on the town brought it all crashing down. Now he’s out of options, except for playing well, studying hard, and staying away from girls. He’s not supposed to be flirting with the hottest, sweetest chick he’s ever met. But how could he possibly stay away?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Skylar Lynwood knows that Jacob is out of her league. She’s just trying to go with the flow, which isn’t easy when six feet and four inches of total hockey hunkiness is making a play for her one moment, then giving her the cold shoulder the next. Skylar’s head tells her that this rugged athlete isn’t worth her time, but her body says something altogether different. Risking her heart for Jacob may be the craziest thing she’s ever done . . . but she won’t let him shut her out.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Killian Bosch knows he’s his own worst enemy – he just doesn’t give a damn. The star forward of a minor league hockey team, he’s unstoppable on the ice. His reckless behavior, devil-may-care attitude and complete disregard for consequences have made him a major source of headaches for the Fenway Flyers’ brass. &lt;br /&gt;But the new Flyers owner is more steel than brass. Sidney Stahl is a disciplined woman who parlayed earnings from a college job into a real estate empire. She’s determined to transform the Flyers from marketing nightmare to hockey powerhouse. Once she gets Killian in line, she knows the rest of the team will follow his lead. &lt;br /&gt;The seduction of his sexy new team owner is a challenge too forbidden for Killian to resist. Sidney plays into his attraction as a means of controlling him, but soon finds that she’s the one surrendering. It’s all on the line as Killian and Sidney are forced to choose - business or pleasure? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As an NHL player, relationships haven’t been my thing. Shrouded in secrecy and speculation, they never last very long. But then that’s what happens when you require an NDA before the first date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Charlene. She’s like a firefly. She’s elusive, and if you catch her she’ll burn bright, but keeping her trapped dulls her fire and dims her beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caught her. And as much as I might want to keep her, I’ll never put the lid on her jar. Not at the risk of losing her. So I've let her set the rules in our relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as long hidden secrets expose us both, I discover exactly how fragile Charlene is, and how much I need her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re all broken. We’re all messed up. Some more than others. Me more than most.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where, two centuries ago, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters’ return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only Penny sees what others cannot. And she will be forced to choose: save Bo, or save herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is the Dragons’ new wide receiver: A) a fallen NFL star looking for a comeback, B) the sexy player your boss wants you to write an exposé on, or C) the former love of your life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Milwaukee Dragons beat reporter Natalie Griffith, he’s clearly &lt;i&gt;D) all of the above&lt;/i&gt;. Three years ago, Natalie’s bombshell report on her ex-boyfriend’s off-the-field scandals landed her the job she loves, but she still feels guilty about destroying his career. Now Quinn Lowry’s back, and he’s taking over &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; locker room, flashing his charming smile and reminding her exactly how hot they were together.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After two years out of the league, Quinn is sober and on the field again. He’s worked his ass off and he’s not going to blow his second chance, not even for the woman who broke his heart—twice. Having Natalie around is the last thing Quinn needs while he’s trying to prove he deserves to stay on the team.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe one final night together will give them both some much-needed closure. But with Natalie’s boss pressuring her for another headline-grabbing scoop, can she admit to herself that she’s falling for Quinn all over again?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first rule of this book club:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don't talk about book club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nashville Legends second baseman Gavin Scott's marriage is in major league trouble. He’s recently discovered a humiliating secret: his wife Thea has always faked the Big O. When he loses his cool at the revelation, it’s the final straw on their already strained relationship. Thea asks for a divorce, and Gavin realizes he’s let his pride and fear get the better of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Bromance Book Club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught and desperate, Gavin finds help from an unlikely source: a secret romance book club made up of Nashville's top alpha men. With the help of their current read, a steamy Regency titled &lt;i&gt;Courting the Countess&lt;/i&gt;, the guys coach Gavin on saving his marriage. But it'll take a lot more than flowery words and grand gestures for this hapless Romeo to find his inner hero and win back the trust of his wife.</description>

  <description>What do you do when an NHL player steals your dog and won’t give it back? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie Hudson made a heartbreaking decision nine years ago that has haunted her ever since. To fill the hole in her life, she showers her rescue dog with love and affection. But one day, Kirby goes missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six months later, NHL player Spencer Corbett is astonished when Maggie shows up on his doorstep demanding her dog back. He’d found the pug on the side of the road, collarless and in bad shape. But even when confronted with hard evidence she’s the dog’s owner, he begs her to reconsider. His own elderly dog is on her last legs and Kirby has given her a new lease on life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After Maggie relents, Spencer can’t help but fall for her. Not only is she the most compassionate and selfless person he’s ever met, she’s witty, intelligent and sexier than sin and doesn’t even realize. What starts out as a friendship quickly turns into more, but when a woman from Spencer’s past throws everything into chaos, their fragile relationship is put to the ultimate test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Animal Attraction may be read and enjoyed as a standalone sports romance!</description>

  <description>Can a romcom-obssessed romantic finally experience the meet-cute she always dreamed of or will reality never compare to fiction, in this charming debut adult novel from Kerry Winfrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Cassidy dreams of being the next Nora Ephron. She spends her days writing screenplays, rewatching Sleepless in Seattle, and waiting for her movie-perfect meet-cute. If she could just find her own Tom Hanks—a man who’s sweet, sensitive, and possibly owns a houseboat—her problems would disappear and her life would be perfect. But Tom Hanks is nowhere in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a movie starts filming in her neighborhood and Annie gets a job on set, it seems like a sign. Then Annie meets the lead actor, Drew Danforth, a cocky prankster who couldn’t be less like Tom Hanks if he tried. Their meet-cute is more of a meet-fail, but soon Annie finds herself sharing some classic rom-com moments with Drew. Her Tom Hanks can’t be an actor who’s leaving town in a matter of days...can he?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A standalone romantic comedy of epically awkward proportions, from New York Times bestselling author, Emma Hart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine this. You’re ready to leave after a one-night stand, and you’re figuring out how to—shock horror—leave your number and ask him to be your fake boyfriend for your sister’s wedding this weekend. When he wakes up. Well, that happened to me. And over coffee and omelets, I found myself a date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which was how I ended up arriving at the wedding with a guy I knew nothing about. I didn’t know his last name, or how we met, or how long we’d been dating. I didn’t know where he grew up, what he’d majored in in college, or how many siblings he had. I sure as hell didn’t know he was Adam Winters, hotshot hockey player—and not only my father’s favorite player, but my little nephew’s freakin’ idol. Which means I’m in trouble. Big, big trouble. My mother is suspicious, my sister is bridezilla on crack, and my grandpa will tell anyone who’ll listen about his time in Amsterdam’s Red Light District. Four days. I have to keep this up for four days, and then Adam and I can return to our regular lives, where we don’t have sex whenever we’re alone and my family aren’t interrogating him over his intentions with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least, that’s the plan. And we all know what happens to those.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's about to make a deal with the college bad boy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; him take notice... even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, &lt;i&gt;cocky&lt;/i&gt; captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and it's going to be oh so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn't take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn't going to cut it. Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When your name is Wynn, victory’s the only option...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everly Wynn:&lt;/b&gt; As the only daughter in the Wynn family of hockey heroes, I never shared the ice with my brothers—or the approval they got from my father.&lt;br /&gt;And that was before the scandal that ruined my life at sixteen.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I’ve put all that behind me and built a successful career, the last thing I need is another hockey player in my life. &lt;br /&gt;Especially one like Wyatt Bell. &lt;br /&gt;He’s an arrogant, fast-living party boy. I hate how he gets by on his good looks and charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;So why can’t I get him out of my mind?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wyatt Bell:&lt;/b&gt; Life is short, and you’ve got to live it to the fullest. I learned that the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;So on the ice, I always play to win, and on the town, fun and flirting are my game. &lt;br /&gt;Because it’s better to laugh your way through the pain than to let them see you’re hurting—but I’ll never stop wishing I could find someone to share the real me with. &lt;br /&gt;Something about Everly Wynn makes me think she could be the one. &lt;br /&gt;But all she sees is a hockey jock hooked on good times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;If she didn’t take herself so seriously, maybe she would take a chance on being happy.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wynn family bonds bend but never break. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;JP Wynn:&lt;/b&gt; I admit, I’ve made some bad choices—on and off the ice.&lt;br /&gt; Now all I want to do is show my team I can control my emotions while I’m playing and redeem myself with my family, especially with my brother, Théo.&lt;br /&gt; I hate that I hurt him and I’m determined to stay out of trouble. &lt;br /&gt; But the hot bridesmaid at Théo’s wedding is tempting me into another bad decision.&lt;br /&gt; A little flirting and a hook up with Taylor seem harmless . . . until Manny Martinez jumps me on the dance floor and starts beating the crap out of me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And just like that I add one more bad decision to my résumé.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Taylor Hart:&lt;/b&gt; I always thought hockey players were hot. Now I think they’re crazy.&lt;br /&gt; Manny broke my heart when he got traded to another team and left without even a goodbye.&lt;br /&gt; Then he showed up at my best friend’s wedding. All I wanted to do was show Manny that I was over him.&lt;br /&gt; And the groom’s sexy brother, JP, seemed more than willing to be my distraction.&lt;br /&gt; But after the way everything went down, I want nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;of them. &lt;br /&gt; Easier said than done. Especially when Lacey’s new brother-in-law is always around. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And I keep thinking about the wedding night, when we snuck away to his room for the best sex of my life.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the Wynns—a hockey dynasty built on family, money, and drama. From &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Kelly Jamieson, the first novel in a new series is a total win-win.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After an injury forced &lt;b&gt;Théo Wynn&lt;/b&gt; to give up professional hockey, he turned to his second love: numbers. Now, as the general manager of his grandfather’s NHL team, the Los Angeles Condors, Théo is dying to prove to the rest of his family—especially the brother who betrayed him—that he’s just as successful as the rest of them. If only Théo had a gorgeous woman on his arm to complete the picture. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lacey Olson&lt;/b&gt; needs to get out of Las Vegas right now, thanks to her no-good, crooked brother. When a handsome stranger who’s out partying with friends comes to her rescue in the cocktail lounge where she works, they strike up a conversation that leads to a crazy plan: her leaving with Théo for L.A. tomorrow. A few drinks later, the idea gets even crazier: a quickie marriage that works for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But back in California, Lacey immediately turns Théo’s precise, well-ordered life into one big beach party. And before long, she’s tempting him with her smart mouth, sexy body, and sunny charm. The last thing Théo needs is a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; relationship to distract him. Because he only plays to win. . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Kelly Jamieson’s &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Aces Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MAJOR MISCONDUCT&lt;br /&gt; OFF LIMITS&lt;br /&gt; ICING&lt;br /&gt; TOP SHELF&lt;br /&gt; BACK CHECK&lt;br /&gt; SLAP SHOT&lt;br /&gt; PLAYING HURT&lt;br /&gt; BIG STICK&lt;br /&gt; GAME ON&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s alluring reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT | LONG SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brooding hockey hunk learns to embrace life—and love—from a single mom who takes the world one puck at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big move . . .&lt;/b&gt; Jodie's motto is "Don't wait for the perfect moment - take the moment and make it perfect." And that's just what she decides to do when she moves to Chicago with her two-year-old daughter. Now all Jodie needs is a place to live, and her best friend's boyfriend has just the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big stick . . .&lt;/b&gt; Nick Balachov has zero interest in socializing, partying, or flirting right now. It's not that he doesn't like women. He loves them. It's just that hockey, casual hookups, and hanging out at home are enough for him these days. Now Nick has a big problem - because the woman living in his empty coach house is a major distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big deal?&lt;/b&gt; The more Nick tries to keep his distance, the more Jodie needs him - around the house, that is. First he helps with the snowstorm, then the power outage. Nick even finds himself trying to impress her little girl. What the hell is wrong with him? Jodie represents everything Nick doesn't want. But maybe she's just what he needs. . . .&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s playing hurt. She’s laying low. And they’re both flirting with disaster.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chase:&lt;/i&gt; The last thing I’d ever want to do is let my team down. After overcoming my bad-boy reputation, I was dominating on the ice. But things aren’t going so well this season, and even my parents think I’m partying again. Now I’m really worried about my career. The only bright spot in my life is the Twitter flirtation I’ve struck up with pop princess Jordyn Banks. Turns out she’s a huge hockey fan—and she’s willing to wager a date on her favorite team. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jordyn:&lt;/i&gt; Even though I’m an L.A. fan now, I’ve always had a soft spot for the Aces, since I grew up in Chicago. Then I lose a bet to Chase Hartman, and suddenly I’m up close and personal with a pro athlete who’s anything but soft. Not only is Chase the hottest guy I’ve ever met, he’s secretly super sweet. As if I had time for a relationship . . . yeah, right. But when I suddenly have nothing but time on my hands, he’s the only one who understands. Now, with both of our careers at stake, Chase is tempting me to put my heart on the line too.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The so-bad-they’re-good alphas of hockey’s Chicago Aces are back in this emotionally charged novel of sex, love, and second chances from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Top Shelf &lt;/i&gt;and the Heller Brothers series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Tanner Bennet hates weddings. They just remind him that he simply isn’t cut out for any kind of healthy, committed relationship—never has been, never will be. After getting rejected by the girl he thought was “the one” all those years ago, he made a huge mistake and married the wrong person. Now that the divorced heartbreaker has reluctantly agreed to be a groomsman for one of his NHL teammates, the last thing he expects is a chance at redemption with the one that got away.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After Marc Dupuis of the Chicago Aces hires wedding planner Katelyn Medford, she discovers that her big break comes with a twist: a reunion with her college sweetheart. The way she dumped Tanner still haunts her. Eight years—and three broken engagements—later, Katelyn knows she’ll never have that kind of innocent, wide-eyed passion again. Still, she and Tanner soon generate enough body heat to burn up the sheets. And even with Tanner’s career with the Aces up in the air, Katelyn’s wondering whether the time is right to let him in for real.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for Kelly Jamieson and her Aces Hockey series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Kelly Jamieson is my go-to author for hockey romance.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jami Davenport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “With chemistry that melts the ice, this novel had me rushing into the zone to finish before the whistle blew. I really enjoyed it!”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Toni Aleo, &lt;/b&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Icing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “A sweet story with plenty of heart about that bad boy you always wanted, who couldn’t wait to have you, too.”&lt;b&gt;—Award-winning author Cecy Robson, &lt;/b&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Off Limits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Steamy, sweet, and a whole lot of fun! I loved &lt;i&gt;Major Misconduct&lt;/i&gt;!”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Serena Bell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A love so epic, no label is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Sato’s got labels. Tourettes, ADHD, SPD - words that have defined his existence since the time he was old enough to know what they meant. Now, Van wants to prove he’s more than an acronym, a syndrome, a problem kid. He takes a summer job as a day camp counselor to prove he’s capable of independence and moving on to the next phase in his life. Maybe, he might even make a friend while there. Someone who’s got just as many or even more labels than him. Someone who understands what it’s like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabby Dubanowksi wants to forget about everything, the hospitalization, the judgment, the whispers behind her back. As a camp counselor, she will be admired, looked up to, and able to help people who don’t know anything about her old life. Tabby wants a fresh start and a chance to re-ignite her passion for film-making, if only for one summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running away from their pasts, Van and Tabby collide in a storm cloud of attraction laced with self-doubt, insecurity, shame, and blame. Now, with Van feeling like he might have to quit his job, and Tabby struggling to quell the urge to cut, they will struggle to find themselves in a world designed to keep them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Whether it’s a clutch goal or a cocktail, nothing beats “top shelf.” In this new novel in Kelly Jamieson’s Aces Hockey series, a fun-loving jock and an ambitious career woman prove that sometimes the best drink is made by mixing business with pleasure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not only is Jared Rupp one of the stars of the NHL’s Chicago Aces, he’s also the owner of the Sin Bin, the after-hours hot spot where the whole team hangs out. Lately, Jared can’t take his eyes off the woman he’s hired to give the Bin a more modern feel: a sexy, sophisticated consultant who has carved out a niche updating drink menus. She’s as passionate about her career as Jared is about hockey—and yet he can’t help wondering what kind of cocktail she &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wants.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In her line of work, Sidney Frayne is used to guys hitting on her in bars, but Jared gets her hot enough to burst into flames. When he’s wining and dining her, he’s sophisticated as hell; on the rink, he’s a testosterone-fueled powerhouse. Still, Sidney’s bitter divorce taught her to keep her emotions on ice. With her busy schedule—and Jared’s playboy reputation—she’s not sure she’s ready for a fling. Because if she lets Jared into her bed, she just may have to let him into her heart.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Kelly Jamieson and her Aces Hockey series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Kelly Jamieson is my go-to author for hockey romance.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jami Davenport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “A sweet story with plenty of heart about that bad boy you always wanted, who couldn’t wait to have you too.”&lt;b&gt;—Award-winning author Cecy Robson, &lt;/b&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Off Limits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Steamy, sweet, and a whole lot of fun!

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Sawyer Bennett and Toni Aleo, Kelly Jamieson’s charming holiday novella kicks off a brand-new series featuring the hunky hockey stars of the Chicago Aces.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Christmas season always puts a smile on Jenna McFadden’s face. Even though she’s bringing a boyfriend home for the first time, inside she’s dying to see Andrew. Years ago, when the McFaddens took the troubled teen into their home, Jenna had to keep her blazing-hot crush a secret. And now that he’s playing pro hockey for the NHL’s Chicago Aces, nothing’s changed. With his wide shoulders and taut muscles, Andrew’s the most tempting package in the house . . . one that Jenna’s dying to unwrap.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Andrew Ross just can’t make a play for Jenna. Her dad and brothers wouldn’t approve, and he could never betray the trust of the wonderful people who treated him like family when he lost his own. That’s what makes the holidays so hard. Whether Jenna’s skating with Andrew on a frozen pond or sitting on his lap while he plays Santa, she’s pushing all their boundaries—and there’s only so much a man can take. Andrew knows that she’s off-limits. But something deep down tells him that Jenna’s heart is the one prize he simply has to win.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hailed by Jami Davenport as her “go-to author for hockey romance,” the bestselling author of the Heller Brothers Hockey series sets the ice ablaze with another sexy novel featuring the gorgeous men of the Chicago Aces.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duncan Armstrong may be an NHL star, but he’s a country boy at heart. His ultimate fantasy is going home with the Stanley Cup, not a gold-digging airhead who aspires to be a trophy wife and nothing more. Newly single and hoping to enjoy a night out with his teammates, he ends up hitting it off with a down-to-earth waitress who’s a complete breath of fresh air—until Duncan learns that she’s a part-time model. He tries to forget about her, but their sizzling chemistry has him coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amber is working hard to put herself through school, and has zero interest in dating a professional athlete. She’s seen firsthand how fame and fortune can mess with their heads—her father’s brilliant football career ended in a firestorm of addiction and infidelity. So Duncan’s attentions immediately have her on the defensive. Still, there’s something different about him. And once she stops trying to freeze him out, irresistible temptation turns into all-consuming passion.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Kelly Jamieson’s seductive new Chicago Aces romance—perfect for readers of Sawyer Bennett and Toni Aleo—a fun-loving free spirit tempts an uptight hockey star into opening himself up to love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the captain of the Chicago Aces, Marc Dupuis is all business. The apartment he shares with his teammate and best friend, Duncan, is a refuge from the pressures of fame. But when the sexiest woman he’s ever seen interrupts his early morning coffee wearing only a skimpy cami and matching panties, Marc can’t exactly say he minds. Their chemistry is off the charts. Unfortunately, this girl’s no random puck bunny. She’s Duncan’s little sister—and she’s moving in.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lovey Armstrong could stare at Marc’s chiseled abs and listen to his French-Canadian accent all day. She just has no idea what’s going on inside his head: When he’s not charming her pants off, Marc makes a Zamboni machine seem warm and cuddly. Lovey knows the team’s bro code says no messing with sisters, but all these mixed messages are hard on a girl’s self-esteem—especially since she’s finally getting her new life together in Chicago. She decides he’s worth another shot . . . because if anyone can melt the ice around Marc’s heart, it’s Lovey.</description>

  <description>My name’s Max Hall, and I need to f***. As a pro hockey player who’s been away from the game for over a year, my libido has picked one hell of an an inconvenient time to come roaring back to life.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After my wife died from a rare form of cancer, sex was the last thing on my mind. Same with hockey, the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; love of my life. Now, after fifteen months of eating too much, drinking too much, and generally just feeling sorry for myself, I’m facing a steep uphill battle to get my ass in shape and play my way back onto the Chicago Aces.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; So I’m not looking for a relationship. Just sex. Yeah, I know how that makes me sound. But the truth is, I’ll never love another woman the way I loved my wife. When I meet a sexy bridesmaid at my teammate’s wedding, I decide to scratch that itch. A fling with Kendra Armstrong in her posh hotel room could be just what the trainer ordered.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Not only is Kendra smokin’ hot, she’s dynamite in bed—one of the perks of being a sex toy designer. Since she lives in New York anyway, we agree to keep things casual, no strings attached. The arrangement is perfect . . . until one of us falls in love. And it’s not me.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Kelly Jamieson’s &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Aces Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MAJOR MISCONDUCT&lt;br /&gt; OFF LIMITS&lt;br /&gt; ICING&lt;br /&gt; TOP SHELF&lt;br /&gt; BACK CHECK&lt;br /&gt; SLAP SHOT&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s alluring reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

While every other college student is out having fun, Lyla is studying. With her cat. Well, she's played it "safe" quite enough, thank you.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the stakes are this high, it’s game on. . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Carly Phillips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cam Brickley and his pro hockey teammates bet on everything: who can win five faceoffs in a row, who can do forty pushups in less than a minute, who can eat a ghost pepper without puking. But when his buddies bet him he can’t date the same woman—like, say, the hot blonde over at the bar—for two months and not fall in love, he’ll take that bet all day. Then he’ll laugh all the way to the hockey arena, where they’ll be washing his jock straps for the rest of the season, because Cam’s never giving up his bachelor lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Olivia Lockwood, heiress to the Lockwood Industries fortune, is used to people using her for her money and family connections. When Cam Brickley hits on her in a club, Olivia’s first instinct is to brush him off. But &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; couldn’t be using her for her money, since he has more than enough of his own. Cam’s gorgeous and built, and it would be no hardship to go out with him . . . besides, he’d be the perfect spokesperson for the children’s charity she works with. Maybe it’s time for &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; to start using people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cam and Olivia are both in it for something. What they don’t know yet is that they’re playing for keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Kelly Jamieson’s &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Aces Hockey series can be read together or separately:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MAJOR MISCONDUCT&lt;br /&gt; OFF LIMITS&lt;br /&gt; ICING&lt;br /&gt; TOP SHELF&lt;br /&gt; BACK CHECK&lt;br /&gt; SLAP SHOT&lt;br /&gt; PLAYING HURT&lt;br /&gt; BIG STICK&lt;br /&gt; GAME ON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Don’t miss any of Kelly’s alluring reads:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bayard Hockey series: &lt;b&gt;SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Last Shot series: &lt;b&gt;BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT | LONG SHOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The standalone novel: &lt;b&gt;DANCING IN THE RAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Game On&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Kelly Jamieson does it again with another ice-melting read. &lt;i&gt;Game On&lt;/i&gt; is all that!”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Heidi McLaughlin&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In this hilarious follow-up novel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;I Hate Everyone But You&lt;/i&gt;, long distance best friends Ava and Gen have finally made it to the same time zone (although they’re still over a thousand miles apart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through their hilarious, sometimes emotional, but always relatable conversations, Ava and Gen are each other’s support systems through internships, relationship troubles, questionable roommates, undercover reporting, and whether or not it’s a good idea to take in a feral cat. &lt;i&gt;Please Send Help &lt;/i&gt;perfectly captures the voice of young adults looking to find their place in the world and how no matter how desperate things seem, you always have your best friend to tell it like it is and pick you back up.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>Noah Ramsey has a great hockey career, wonderful parents, and a good best friend, but what he wants most is to be with the love of his life who walked away from him years ago. When he finds her at the airport, he realizes she's changed, and she's struggling with things she doesn't want to tell him about. Noah also realizes just how much she scarred him when she left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meredith Quick has always planned everything out. She chose her tennis career over love in order to better succeed, but her plan dissolves when an injury threatens her career and her fiancé leaves her. Struggling through pain and the uncertainty of her future, she realizes her first misstep was walking away from Noah. She impulsively decides to go back to him while she attempts to put her life back together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reacquainting isn't easy when Noah doesn't quite trust Meredith to stay and Meredith struggles with overcoming the pain she's endured without him. Can they work through their issues and move forward, or will their past ruin things between them forever?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mayan god of death sends a young woman on a harrowing, life-changing journey in this dark, one-of-a-kind fairy tale inspired by Mexican folklore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Jazz Age is in full swing, but Casiopea Tun is too busy cleaning the floors of her wealthy grandfather’s house to listen to any fast tunes. Nevertheless, she dreams of a life far from her dusty small town in southern Mexico. A life she can call her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet this new life seems as distant as the stars, until the day she finds a curious wooden box in her grandfather’s room. She opens it—and accidentally frees the spirit of the Mayan god of death, who requests her help in recovering his throne from his treacherous brother. Failure will mean Casiopea’s demise, but success could make her dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the company of the strangely alluring god and armed with her wits, Casiopea begins an adventure that will take her on a cross-country odyssey from the jungles of Yucatán to the bright lights of Mexico City—and deep into the darkness of the Mayan underworld.</description>

  <description>Everyone says hotshot goalie Luke Jackson is God’s gift to girls, but the only girl he wants is his best friend, Malina Hall. He’s always known how brilliant she is, but now that he’s “accidentally” kissed her, he can’t stop thinking about her…or wanting to kiss her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, things have been a little…awkward since the kiss. Because she likes him, too? Hopefully, but even if she did, their futures—and the ridiculous schedules that come with them—are in the way. And now one of his teammates is showing interest, and the guy has more in common with Malina than Jackson ever will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her best friend, Jackson should get out of the way. But if there’s one thing he’s learned from hockey, it’s that you have to go for what you want, even if it means falling flat on your face. And he’s definitely falling for Malina.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Morris Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Serpent King&lt;/i&gt; comes a contemporary novel about two best friends who must make tough decisions about their futures–and the TV show they host–in their senior year of high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Friday night, best friends Delia and Josie become Rayne Ravenscroft and Delilah Darkwood, hosts of the campy creature feature show Midnite Matinee on the local cable station TV Six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the end of senior year quickly approaching, the girls face tough decisions about their futures. Josie has been dreading graduation, as she tries to decide whether to leave for a big university and chase her dream career in mainstream TV. And Lawson, one of the show’s guest performers, a talented MMA fighter with weaknesses for pancakes, fantasy novels, and Josie, is making her tough decision even harder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scary movies are the last connection Delia has to her dad, who abandoned the family years ago. If Midnite Matinee becomes a hit, maybe he’ll see it and want to be a part of her life again. And maybe Josie will stay with the show instead of leaving her behind, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tug-of-war between growing up and growing apart tests the bonds of their friendship, Josie and Delia start to realize that an uncertain future can be both monstrous…and momentous.</description>

  <description>The first novel in the Iron Druid Chronicles--introducing a cool, new, funny urban fantasy hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atticus O'Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he's twenty-one "centuries" old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he's hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power--plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish--to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.

  <description>Cvareh returns home to his sky world of Nova with the genius crafter Arianna as his temperamental guest. The mercurial inventor possesses all the Xin family needs to turn the tides of a centuries-old power struggle, but the secrets she harbors must be earned with trust -- hard to come by for Ari, especially when it comes to Dragons. On Nova, Ari finds herself closer to exacting vengeance against the traitor who killed everything -- and everyone – she once loved. But before Ari can complete her campaign of revenge, the Crimson Court exposes her shadowed past and reveals something even more dangerous sparking between her and Cvareh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Nova is embroiled in blood sport and political games, the rebels on Loom prepare for an all-out assault on their Dragon oppressors. Florence unexpectedly finds herself at the forefront of change, as her unique blend of skills -- and quick-shooting accuracy -- makes her a force to be reckoned with. For the future of her world, she vows vengeance against the Dragons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the rebellion can rise, though, the Guilds must fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 25 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristen Leonard is done with setups. She’s not interested in your son or your nephew or your butcher or the guy who mows your lawn, thank you very much, grandma! After all, she’s a modern woman—she’ll take her chances on the algorithms of online dating to find her ideal man. Before long, she meets a man who might just be the one—he’s hilarious, quick-witted, and full of heart. And when she meets up with Cameron in real life, he certainly looks exactly like his profile picture…but something’s not quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s really no telling what brought them together and all bets are off as to whether or not they can trust their hearts over their heads. After all, can you fall in love with someone you’re not sure you really even know?</description>

  <description>With a famous NHL player for a stepbrother, Violet Hall is well acquainted with the playboy reputation of many a hockey star. So of course she isn't interested in legendary team captain Alex Waters or his pretty, beat-up face and rock-hard six-pack abs. But when Alex inadvertently obliterates Violet's misapprehension regarding the inferior intellect of hockey players, he becomes much more than just a hot body with the face to match. Suffering from a complete lapse in judgment, Violet discovers just how good Alex is with the hockey stick in his pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet believes her night of orgasmic magic with Alex is just that: one night. But Alex starts to call. And text. And email and send extravagant - and quirky - gifts. Suddenly he's too difficult to ignore and nearly impossible not to like. The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn't want to be part of the game.</description>

  <description>Aiden Emerson is an all-star pitcher and the all-around golden boy of Riverton. Or at least he was, before he quit the team the last day of junior year without any explanation. How could he tell people he's losing his vision at seventeen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight-laced Olivia thought she had life all figured out. But when her dream internship falls apart, her estranged mother comes back into her life, and her long-time boyfriend ghosts her right before summer break, she's starting to think fate has a weird sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each struggling to find a new direction, Aiden and Olivia decide to live summer by chance. Every fleeting adventure and stolen kiss is as fragile as a coin flip in this heartfelt journey to love and self-discovery from the author of Love Songs &amp;amp; Other Lies.</description>

  <description>Adaline Frost’s life officially sucks. Now that her BFF has found her true love, Addy is constantly stuck being the third wheel. On top of that, she hasn’t started her junior project yet, so her advisor pairs her up with what could only be described as the “Reject Breakfast Club.” Instead of the weirdo and the troublemaker, Addy is forced to work with two stoners, a popular girl, and her crush, Austin Reed, the jock who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Reed is sick of being labeled “dumb jock.” If he doesn’t get an A on this project, he can kiss his future goodbye. Austin thought he’d gotten lucky being partners with the very nerdy Adaline Frost, but boy was he wrong. Addy jumps down his throat about his being late and calls him names like “manwhore” on the daily. She has no idea Austin works before and after school in order to help his mom with the bills. Yeah, he’s made mistakes and has had lots of girlfriends, but he doesn’t need Adaline Frost to remind him of it every time he sees her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Austin and Addy ever be a thing?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A guide for sports fans on how to watch and appreciate the game of hockey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More and more fans are watching the NHL each week, but many of them don’t know exactly what they should be watching. How does an offense create shooting lanes for its best sniper? When a center breaks through and splits between two defensemen, which defender is to blame? Why does a goalie look like a Hall of Famer one week and a candidate for the minor leagues the next? This guide for sports fans on how to watch and appreciate the game of hockey takes you inside a coach’s mind as he builds a roster or constructs a game plan, to the chaos of the goalie’s crease, and deep into the perpetual chess match between offense and defense. Discussing topics such as what to look for when a team goes on the power play and why playing center might be the most grueling job in sports, &lt;i&gt;Take Your Eye Off the Puck &lt;/i&gt;shows fans how to get the most out of watching their favorite sport.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves hockey superstar Pierce Miller. Everyone except Lia Bailey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the two are forced to teach a skating class to save the rink, Lia’s not sure she’ll survive the pressure of Nationals and Pierce’s ego. Not only can’t he remember her name, he signed her bottle of water like she was one of his groupies. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if there’s one thing Lia knows better than figure skating, it’s hockey. Hoping to take his ego down a notch—or seven—she logs into his team website under an anonymous name to give him pointers on his less-than-stellar playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, Pierce isn’t arrogant at all. And they have a lot in common. Too bad he’s falling for the anonymous girl online. No matter how much fun they’re starting to have in real life, she’s afraid he’s going to choose fake-Lia over the real one...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This book contains a swoony hockey player (and his equally swoony friends!), one-too-many social media accounts, kisses that’ll melt ice, and a secret identity that might not be so secret after all...&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Alice Bell has one goal: to play for the elite junior hockey team the Chicago Falcons. But when she’s passed over at tryouts for being a girl, she’ll do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to make her dream a reality…even disguising herself as her twin brother. With her amazing skills on the ice, Alice is sure she’ll fit in easily. That is, until she starts falling for one of her teammates…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayden Tremblay, star of the Falcons, can’t keep himself out of the penalty box. Constantly living in the shadow of his older brother, Hayden’s losing his passion for hockey. But when he gets shown up on the ice by the Falcons’ new rookie, Hayden’s determined to teach the kid a thing or two. Little does he guess that “Al’s” surprises on the ice are just the beginning... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush title proves that wonderful things can happen when you’re brave enough to go after your dream. Dream hockey player, that is! Warning--a few locker room scenes are included...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Star hockey player Daniel Sacachelli wants only two things: 1) for the Falcons&lt;br /&gt;to win next season, and 2) for his secret — the fact he’s actually the prince of Eldonia — to never make its way to Chicago. But if Daniel keeps avoiding his crown, their family will lose their kingdom forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison Myong can’t believe that her will-they-or-won’t-they best friend Daniel is&lt;br /&gt;really a prince! He’s always seemed more rebel than royal. But now, he needs to clean up his image, fast. Posing as his long-time girlfriend, Madison accompanies him back to Eldonia, intending to give Daniel a makeover fit for a king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, the more royal Daniel becomes, the more Madison misses her best friend. And if she does her job right, she’ll lose him forever...</description>

  <description>Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction. Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In Norse Mythology, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.</description>

      <![CDATA[This review was originally posted on my review blog <a href="https://deannareadsbooks.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Deanna Reads Books</a><br />I LOVE mythology, and I love reading books about Norse society, so I was pretty psyched to read this collection of Norse Mythology stories from Neil Gaiman. I will say, that these stories are more close to the real myths we know...</a>]]>

  <description>Miriam's family should be rich. After all, her grandfather was the co-creator of smash-hit comics series The TomorrowMen. But he sold his rights to the series to his co-creator in the 1960s for practically nothing, and now that's what Miriam has: practically nothing. And practically nothing to look forward to either-how can she afford college when her family can barely keep a roof above their heads? As if she didn't have enough to worry about, Miriam's life gets much more complicated when a cute boy shows up in town . . . and turns out to be the grandson of the man who defrauded Miriam's grandfather, and heir to the TomorrowMen fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her endearing debut novel, cartoonist Faith Erin Hicks pens a sensitive and funny Romeo and Juliet tale about modern romance, geek royalty, and what it takes to heal the long-festering scars of the past (Spoiler Alert: love).</description>

  <description>Alicea Springer was Boyfriend Whisperer Enterprises’ top success story. That is, until her dream date, Ty Walker, dumped her a week before prom. Now it’s senior year, and Alicea has taken over the business and given it an upgrade using an automated matchmaking program designed to help her classmates find their perfect match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alicea has no interest in using the program herself. She already knows who her perfect match is … Ty. She doesn’t need an app to tell her that (or worse, match her up with someone else). In a moment of weakness, Alicea allows her friends to convince her to give the program a try. To her horror, it matches her with the last boy on earth she'd ever want to date — Darius Groves, the class deadbeat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she and Darius are paired up for a class project, Alicea learns there's more to him than his bad reputation. But the more she spends time with Darius, the more she questions their match. They have so little in common. Why did her program match them? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Alicea defy the odds and make a match of her own heart’s desire? Or will the matchmaker remained unmatched?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Meg Cabot comes the first story in her Little Bridge Island series—which also includes an excerpt from her forthcoming new full-length novel &lt;em&gt;No Judgments&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for a tropical escape?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Little Bridge, one of the smallest—and most beautiful—islands in the Florida Keys, home to sandy white beaches, salt-rimmed margaritas, stunning sunsets, and some of the quirkiest—but also kindest and most resourceful—people you’ll ever meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical trainer Roberta “Rob” James moved to Little Bridge hoping she’d found paradise, but things haven’t turned out quite as she’d hoped. The closest Rob has come to her “happily ever after” is happy hour at the Mermaid Café with her buddy Bree, the bartender slash waitress who’s got romance problems of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rob’s situation suddenly changes when sheriff’s deputy Ryan Martinez accidentally enrolls in her bridal boot camp class. Turning mush into metal in time for the big day is Rob’s passion (because even the happiest bride could use a little toning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when a guy who’s all mush meets a girl who’s all metal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They discover they have a lot to learn . . . about each other, themselves, and the island paradise they’ve come to call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The storm of the century is about to hit Little Bridge Island, Florida—and it’s sending waves crashing through Sabrina “Bree” Beckham’s love life…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a massive hurricane severs all power and cell service to Little Bridge Island—as well as its connection to the mainland—twenty-five-year-old Bree Beckham isn’t worried . . . at first. She’s already escaped one storm—her emotionally abusive ex—so a hurricane seems like it will be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But animal-loving Bree does become alarmed when she realizes how many islanders have been cut off from their beloved pets. Now it’s up to her to save as many of Little Bridge’s cats and dogs as she can . . . but to do so, she’s going to need help—help she has no choice but to accept from her boss’s sexy nephew, Drew Hartwell, the Mermaid Café’s most notorious heartbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Bree starts falling for Drew, just as Little Bridge’s power is restored and her penitent ex shows up, she has to ask herself if her island fling was only a result of the stormy weather, or if it could last during clear skies too.</description>

  <description>The new gut-wrenching epic from the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sky in the Deep&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Tova has lived among the Svell, the people who found her washed ashore as a child and use her for her gift as a Truthtongue. Her own home and clan are long-faded memories, but the sacred symbols and staves inked over every inch of her skin mark her as one who can cast the rune stones and see into the future. She has found a fragile place among those who fear her, but when two clans to the east bury their age-old blood feud and join together as one, her world is dangerously close to collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in generations, the leaders of the Svell are divided. Should they maintain peace or go to war with the allied clans to protect their newfound power? And when their chieftain looks to Tova to cast the stones, she sets into motion a series of events that will not only change the landscape of the mainland forever but will give her something she believed she could never have again—a home.</description>

  <description>Aphra's back with a brand-new plan that's guaranteed to pay! There's just one teensy problem... it involves surrounding herself with some of the galaxy's biggest baddies. And they don't like the not-so-good doctor's tricks! Her mission to make quick credits by auctioning off an ancient Jedi artifact will start well... and end badly. And that's just when a dark figure from Aphra's past decides to make an appearance! Plus, a solo focus on Aphra's Wookiee shadow, Black Krrsantan! Find out why this beastly bounty hunter is as frightening as they say... and then some! &lt;b&gt;COLLECTING: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;STAR WARS&lt;/i&gt;: DOCTOR APHRA 9-13, ANNUAL</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Ember in the Ashes&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Three Dark Crowns&lt;/i&gt; in this lush debut fantasy novel about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to join a secret group of warriors that ride phoenixes into battle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I had a sister, once…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders—legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire—until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I promised her the throne would not come between us.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders—even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crown of Feathers &lt;/i&gt;is an epic fantasy about love’s incredible power to save—or to destroy. Interspersed throughout is the story of Avalkyra Ashfire, the last Rider queen, who would rather see her empire burn than fall into her sister’s hands.</description>

  <description>The history books say I died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don’t know the half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anastasia “Nastya” Romanov was given a single mission: to smuggle an ancient spell into her suitcase on her way to exile in Siberia. It might be her family’s only salvation. But the leader of the Bolshevik army is after them . . . and he’s hunted Romanov before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nastya’s only chances of survival are to either release the spell, and deal with the consequences, or enlist help from Zash, the handsome soldier who doesn’t act like the average Bolshevik. Nastya’s never dabbled in magic before, but it doesn’t frighten her as much as her growing attraction for Zash. She likes him. She thinks he might even like her . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she’s on one side of a firing squad . . . and he’s on the other.</description>

  <description>The NY Times and USA TODAY bestselling author of Whatever Life Throws at You kicks off a brand-new series perfect for fans of Miranda Kennealy and Abbi Glines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next season was supposed to be his year. Junior Tate Tanley had big plans to ride the varsity bench most of the season, but when the Otters star goalie storms out of the arena during the first home game of the season, Tate is in the spotlight and under the gun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Claire O’Connor, the girl Tate’s admired for years, his sister’s best friend. Claire’s back from a year away at school to take care of her father and help keep the family business—a hockey bar beside the ice rink—afloat. One semester off, that’s what Claire promised herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then straight back to school, out of Juniper Falls. And she has dozens of reasons for wanting to get the hell out. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, the night before Claire left, she came to Tate’s rescue and what could have been a secret that distanced them ended up drawing them closer the moment she returned to town. For Claire and Tate, leaning on each other feels as natural as breathing but with Claire trying her best to leave again and Tate more rooted to his town than ever, it seems like the worst time to fall in love. Assuming either of them can stop it from happening.</description>

  <description>Annie Mathers is America’s sweetheart and heir to a country music legacy full of all the things her Gran warned her about. Superstar Clay Coolidge is most definitely going to end up one of those things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately for Clay, if he can’t convince Annie to join his summer tour, his music label is going to drop him. That’s what happens when your bad boy image turns into bad boy reality. Annie has been avoiding the spotlight after her parents’ tragic death, except on her skyrocketing YouTube channel. Clay’s label wants to land Annie, and Clay has to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swayed by Clay’s undeniable charm and good looks, Annie and her band agree to join the tour. From the start fans want them to be more than just tour mates, and Annie and Clay can’t help but wonder if the fans are right. But if there’s one part of fame Annie wants nothing to do with, it’s a high-profile relationship. She had a front row seat to her parents’ volatile marriage and isn’t interested in repeating history. If only she could convince her heart that Clay, with his painful past and head over heels inducing tenor, isn’t worth the risk.</description>

  <description>Shane has been doing college all wrong. Pre-med, stellar grades, and happy parents…sounds ideal—but Shane's made zero friends, goes home every weekend, and romance…what’s that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life has been dorm, dining hall, class, repeat. Time's a ticking, and she needs a change—there's nothing like moving to a new country to really mix things up. Shane signs up for a semester abroad in London. She's going to right all her college mistakes: make friends, pursue boys, and find adventure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done. She is soon faced with the complicated realities of living outside her bubble, and when self-doubt sneaks in, her new life starts to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane comes to find that, with the right amount of courage and determination one can conquer anything. Throw in some fate and a touch of magic—the possibilities are endless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A romance bookstore owner finds her own happily ever after with a single dad in a new romance series from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Every Dog Has His Day&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryder Copeland is an accomplished architect and one heck of a father...not to mention tall and sexy. He's everything a hero should be, and Lord knows, Maisy Kelly has read enough of her great-aunt Eloise's romance novels to recognize one when she sees one. But like all fairy tales, Maisy can't help but wonder if this Prince Charming is too good to be true...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryder is drawn to the shy, curly haired professor who hires him to convert the Victorian house she's inherited from her aunt into a romance bookstore. Attracted to a woman for the first time since his divorce, Ryder finds himself wishing for a future with Maisy that he knows is impossible. Ryder has never wavered from his plan to leave the small town of Fairdale, North Carolina, so he can give his daughter the life she deserves. But suddenly he's not so sure. And the closer he gets to Maisy, the harder it's going to be to walk away...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>Magic is fading from the Wild Wood. To renew it, goblins must perform an ancient ritual involving the rarest of their kind—a newborn changeling. But when the fateful night arrives to trade a human baby for a goblin one, something goes terribly wrong. After laying the changeling in a human infant’s crib, the goblin Kull is briefly distracted from his task. By the time he turns back, the changeling has already perfectly mimicked the human child. Too perfectly: Kull cannot tell them apart. Not knowing which to bring back, he leaves both babies behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tinn and Cole are raised as human twins, neither knowing what secrets may be buried deep inside one of them. Then when they are twelve years old, a mysterious message arrives, calling the brothers to be heroes and protectors of magic. The boys must leave behind their sleepy town of Endsborough and risk their lives in the Wild Wood, crossing the perilous Oddmire swamp and journeying through the Deep Dark to reach the goblin horde and discover who they truly are.</description>

  <description>What’s up with Cali? Why does she keep changing her gamer tag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s summertime, and even though his good friend Cali moved to another city, Jaden can connect with her online almost every day to play their favorite game, Cross Ups. His mom has loosened her rules on how often he can play, and he has an amazing new controller that will make him even better at tournaments. But then he gets roped into a dorky summer camp with his buddy Hugh, and Cali starts acting really weird . . . So when a last-minute tournament spot opens up in Cali’s city, Jaden jumps at the chance to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things go badly from the start. Jaden loses his controller on the train, and his reunion with Cali is awkward. She’s unhappy, and Jaden can’t figure out why, especially when she’s getting better and better at Cross Ups—and may even win the tournament. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its sharp dialogue and relatable characters, Anyone’s Game, the second book in the Cross Ups series, chronicles the ups and downs of middle school with a relevant, contemporary twist.</description>

  <description>9 hours, 37 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases--a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice--with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan--from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>An exciting new middle reader series from a debut author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All twelve-year-old Jaden wants to do is be the best at Cross Ups, the video game he and his friends can’t stop playing. He knows he could be―if only he didn’t have to hide his gaming from his mom, who’s convinced it will make him violent. After an epic match leads to an invitation to play in a top tournament, Jaden and his friends Devesh and Hugh hatch a plan to get him there. But Jaden’s strict parents and annoying siblings, not to mention a couple of bullies and his confusing feelings for his next-door neighbor Cali, keep getting in the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tournament Trouble marks the first book in a planned series by Sylv Chiang, a captivating new voice in middle reader fiction. With sharp dialogue and relatable characters, it chronicles the ups and downs of middle school with a relevant, contemporary twist. Accompanied by Connie Choi’s lively illustrations, Tournament Trouble invites readers into Jaden’s world, and will leave them eagerly awaiting his next adventure.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

  <description>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, but after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they never seem to buy anything; instead, they "check out" large, obscure volumes from strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clientele's behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends, but when they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstore's secrets extend far beyond its walls.</description>

  <description>When Daniel and Serena unite, their accidental relationship becomes the catalyst for a twelve-year war to continue. Exposing the twisted past of a corrupt city, Daniel, Serena, and everyone they know will come together to fight. But Serena has another battle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a political rumor threatens their lives, Serena must leave her family and join the political front against her will. To survive apart, Daniel has to separate his love from his hatred and join forces with his worst memory to secure Vendona’s war. But very few of them will survive to see the last day. Bad blood or human, a city will burn, snow will fall, and all will be united by catastrophic secrets and irrevocable tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Audiobook Length:&lt;/b&gt; 7 hrs and 24 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack - who has already killed Bod's family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved master storyteller Neil Gaiman returns with a luminous new novel for the audience that embraced his New York Times best-selling modern classic Coraline. Magical, terrifying, and filled with breathtaking adventures, The Graveyard Book is sure to enthrall readers of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: This audiobook edition is narrated by Neil Gaiman. The audiobook narrated by a full cast can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21805393-the-graveyard-book" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The world will end on Saturday. Next Saturday. Just before dinner, according to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, the world's only completely accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655. The armies of Good and Evil are amassing and everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture. And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist. Put New York Times best-selling authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett together...and all Hell breaks loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©1990 Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (P)2009 HarperCollins Publishers</description>

  <description>Set before the events of Solo: A Star Wars Story! Han and Qi'ra don't have a lot in common other than not having a lot. They're street kids on the industrial planet Corellia, doing whatever it takes to get by, dreaming of something more. They each jump at a chance to prove themselves in the perilous world of Corellia's criminal underbelly, only to discover they are on the same mission for the same unscrupulous boss. When the job goes disastrously wrong, Han and Qi'ra are on the run--from pirates, a droid crime syndicate, the Empire, and their boss--and will have to learn to trust each other if they are going to survive.</description>

  <description>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Red Rising thrilled readers and announced the presence of a talented new author. Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Trilogy: Morning Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the time has come.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He wanted a warrior queen. He got a revolutionary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an orphan ward of the Sisterhood, eighteen-year-old Kalinda is destined for nothing more than a life of seclusion and prayer. Plagued by fevers, she’s an unlikely candidate for even a servant’s position, let alone a courtesan or wife. Her sole dream is to continue living in peace in the Sisterhood’s mountain temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a visit from the tyrant Rajah Tarek disrupts Kalinda’s life. Within hours, she is ripped from the comfort of her home, set on a desert trek, and ordered to fight for her place among the rajah’s ninety-nine wives and numerous courtesans. Her only solace comes in the company of her guard, the stoic but kind Captain Deven Naik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with the danger of a tournament to the death—and her growing affection for Deven—Kalinda has only one hope for escape, and it lies in an arcane, forbidden power buried within her.</description>

  <description>A lively, sexy, and thought-provoking East-meets-West story about community, friendship, and women’s lives at all ages—a spicy and alluring mix of &lt;em&gt;Together Tea&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Calendar Girls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every woman has a secret life . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki lives in cosmopolitan West London, where she tends bar at the local pub. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she’s spent most of her twenty-odd years distancing herself from the traditional Sikh community of her childhood, preferring a more independent (that is, Western) life. When her father’s death leaves the family financially strapped, Nikki, a law school dropout, impulsively takes a job teaching a "creative writing" course at the community center in the beating heart of London’s close-knit Punjabi community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of a miscommunication, the proper Sikh widows who show up are expecting to learn basic English literacy, not the art of short-story writing. When one of the widows finds a book of sexy stories in English and shares it with the class, Nikki realizes that beneath their white dupattas, her students have a wealth of fantasies and memories. Eager to liberate these modest women, she teaches them how to express their untold stories, unleashing creativity of the most unexpected—and exciting—kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more women are drawn to the class, Nikki warns her students to keep their work secret from the Brotherhood, a group of highly conservative young men who have appointed themselves the community’s "moral police." But when the widows’ gossip offers shocking insights into the death of a young wife—a modern woman like Nikki—and some of the class erotica is shared among friends, it sparks a scandal that threatens them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;TROUBLE IS BREWING…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the owner of Little Shop of Potions, a magic potion shop specializing in love potions, Carly Bell Hartwell finds her product more in demand than ever. A local soothsayer has predicted that a couple in town will soon divorce—and now it seems every married person in Hitching Post, Alabama, wants a little extra matrimonial magic to make sure they stay hitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Carly finds a dead man in her shop, clutching one of her potion bottles, she goes from most popular potion person to public enemy number one. In no time the murder investigation becomes a witch hunt—literally! Now Carly is going to need to brew up some serious sleuthing skills to clear her name and find the real killer—before the whole town becomes convinced her potions really are to die for!</description>

  <description>This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, melt-the-ice kisses, a drool-worthy hockey player, and a fun summer romance that will leave you smiling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old NHL player Logan Balanchuk came to Corrigan Falls to distract himself from his career-ending injury. He doesn’t want to even hear the word “hockey,” so when he meets Dawn, a beautiful, free-spirited girl who goes skinny-dipping instead of watching the draft, he’s intrigued. Neither of them is looking for anything serious, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn is happy to be a distraction, happy to have an adventurous summer romance with the dashing guy from the big city. She’s busy working three jobs and counting the days until she can move away from her tiny, hockey-obsessed town. Plus, she’s already done her time as a hockey player’s girlfriend—now she wants to live her own life and have her own adventures. But as things heat up with Logan, she realizes they aren’t as no-strings-attached as she thought…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, ice-melting kisses, and a swoon-worthy hero. This fake relationship romance will have you wishing for a hockey player of your own…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie West and Toby Cooper were best friends growing up, on and off the ice. But when Toby’s hockey career took off, their friendship was left behind. Now Natalie has a crazy plan to land her crush—Toby’s biggest rival—and she needs Toby’s help to pull it off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nat asks Toby to be her fake boyfriend, he can’t say no. Not when it means getting his best friend back. But Natalie is all grown up now, and spending time with her—even when it’s just playing hockey together—stirs up a lot of feelings, old and new. Suddenly pretending to be interested in her isn’t hard at all…if only she wanted him and not his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hockey tore them apart. Can it put them back together?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Claudia Waring has never kissed a boy. Never been popular. Never been to a hockey game. All that’s about to change. Assigned to tutor Chris Winslow, a prank-loving, gorgeous hockey player, Claudia’s perfectly planned life immediately veers off course. And she kind of likes it. But as fun as Chris is, she knows she'll never fit in his world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After his latest prank lands him in hot water, Chris has to get serious about school or lose hockey. Not an easy thing for someone as carefree as the defenseman. The biggest problem, though, is how much he wants to help his cute, buttoned-up tutor loosen up a little. But while confidence has never been a problem for him, around Claudia, Chris is all nerves. Why would a girl as smart as her ever fall for a jock like him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, swoon-worthy kisses, and sexy hockey players. It may cause you to watch a hockey game…or ten.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, underage drinking, sexual situations, and crazy squirrels. It may cause you to become a fan of hockey - or at least hot hockey players.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hometown hockey hero won't know what hit him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Webber is in small-town hell. After her mother's death, she moved to Corrigan Falls to live with strangers - her dad and his perfect, shiny new family - and there doesn't seem to be room for a city girl with a chip on her shoulder. The only person who makes her feel like a real human being is Tyler MacDonald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Karen isn't interested in starting something with a player. And that's all she keeps hearing about Tyler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrigan Falls is a hockey town, and Tyler's the star player. But the viselike pressure from his father and his agent are sending him dangerously close to the edge. All people see is hockey - except Karen. Now they've managed to find something in each other that they both desperately need. And for the first time, Tyler is playing for keeps...</description>

  <description>"My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I have burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during the day. I have talked to God's, loved women and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a tale unequaled in fantasy literature - the story of a hero told in his own voice. It is a tale of sorrow, a tale of survival, a tale of one man's search for meaning in his universe, and how that search, and the indomitable will that drove it, gave birth to a legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2009 DAW Trade; (P)2009 Brilliance Audio, Inc.</description>

  <description>ThreeBody Problem is the first chance for English-speaking listeners to experience this multiple award-winning phenomenon from China’s most beloved science fiction author, Liu Cixin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the backdrop of China’s Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Mexico City… An Oasis In A Sea Of Vampires…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Domingo, a lonely garbage-collecting street kid, is busy eking out a living when a jaded vampire on the run swoops into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atl, the descendant of Aztec blood drinkers, must feast on the young to survive and Domingo looks especially tasty. Smart, beautiful, and dangerous, Atl needs to escape to South America, far from the rival narco-vampire clan pursuing her. Domingo is smitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her plan doesn’t include developing any real attachment to Domingo. Hell, the only living creature she loves is her trusty Doberman. Little by little, Atl finds herself warming up to the scrappy young man and his effervescent charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Ana, a cop who suddenly finds herself following a trail of corpses and winds up smack in the middle of vampire gang rivalries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampires, humans, cops, and gangsters collide in the dark streets of Mexico City. Do Atl and Domingo even stand a chance of making it out alive?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;One devoted modern girl + a meddlesome, traditional grandmother = a heartwarming multicultural romantic comedy about finding love where you least expect it&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raina Anand may have finally given in to family pressure and agreed to let her grandmother play matchmaker, but that doesn't mean she has to like it--or that she has to play by the rules. Nani always took Raina's side when she tried to push past the traditional expectations of their tight-knit Indian-immigrant community, but now she's ambushing Raina with a list of suitable bachelors. Is it too much to ask for a little space? Besides, what Nani doesn't know won't hurt her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Raina's life spirals into a parade of Nani-approved bachelors and disastrous blind dates, she must find a way out of this modern-day arranged-marriage trap without shattering her beloved grandmother's dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Go big or go gnome. &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors of &lt;i&gt;Kill the Farm Boy&lt;/i&gt; return to the world of Pell, the irreverent fantasy universe that recalls Monty Python and Terry Pratchett.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skyr is a rich, verdant land claimed by both halflings and gnomes. For centuries, the halflings have worked to undermine gnomish power structures and seize total control--through legal means, certainly, but more insidiously through their extensive organized crime network. Now, threatened with being pushed out entirely, the gnomes are desperate and ready to fight back. Gustave the Goat King faces his first test as a leader: Can he bring peace to a fraught region or will a civil war consume the entire kingdom?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The greatest space adventure of all returns to Marvel! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Skywalker and the ragtag rebel band opposing the Galactic Empire are fresh off their biggest victory so far--the destruction of the massive Death Star. But the Empire's not toppled yet! Join Luke, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and the rest of the Rebel Alliance as they fight for freedom against the evil of Darth Vader and his master, the Emperor! But when a Rebel assault goes very wrong, Han and Leia will have to think fast to make their escape--while Luke finds himself face-to-face with Darth Vader! In the explosive aftermath, a humbled Luke returns to Tatooine to learn more about his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. Meanwhile, Leia and Han undertake a vital--and dangerous--secret mission. But can they succeed without Luke? Plus: the menace of Boba Fett!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLLECTING: STAR WARS 1-6</description>

  <description>11h 5m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Wild, mesmerizing, perversely witty….A Valentine from hell.”&lt;br /&gt; —Janet Maslin, &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publication of Joe Hill’s beautifully textured, deliciously scary debut novel &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box &lt;/em&gt;was greeted with the sort of overwhelming critical acclaim that is rare for a work of skin-crawling supernatural terror. It was cited as a Best Book of the Year by &lt;em&gt;Atlanta&lt;/em&gt; magazine, the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;, to name but a few. Award-winning, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Neil Gaiman of &lt;em&gt;The Sandman, The Graveyard Book, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Anansi Boys &lt;/em&gt;fame calls Joe Hill’s story of a jaded rock star haunted by a ghost he purchased on the internet, “relentless, gripping, powerful.” Open this &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box &lt;/em&gt;from two-time Bram Stoker Award-winner Hill if you dare and see what all the well-deserved hoopla is about.</description>

  <description>Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of seventeen princes in her collection, she is revered across the sea. Until a twist of fate forces her to kill one of her own. To punish her daughter, the Sea Queen transforms Lira into the one thing they loathe most—a human. Robbed of her song, Lira has until the winter solstice to deliver Prince Elian’s heart to the Sea Queen or remain a human forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ocean is the only place Prince Elian calls home, even though he is heir to the most powerful kingdom in the world. Hunting sirens is more than an unsavory hobby—it’s his calling. When he rescues a drowning woman in the ocean, she’s more than what she appears. She promises to help him find the key to destroying all of sirenkind for good—But can he trust her? And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind’s greatest enemy?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“I seen a kid killed…He strangled it, up by the horse.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Billy, a troubled young man, comes to private eye Cormoran Strike’s office to ask for his help investigating a crime he thinks he witnessed as a child, Strike is left deeply unsettled. While Billy is obviously mentally distressed, and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts from his office in a panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to get to the bottom of Billy’s story, Strike and Robin Ellacott—once his assistant, now a partner in the agency—set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful but sinister manor house deep in the countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And during this labyrinthine investigation, Strike’s own life is far from straightforward: his newfound fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it ever has been—Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their personal relationship is much, much trickier than that.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first book in a brutally stunning series where a young girl finds herself becoming more monster than human and must uncover dangerous truths about who she is and the place that has become her home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the last child in a family of daughters, seventeen-year-old Janneke was raised to be the male heir. While her sisters were becoming wives and mothers, she was taught to hunt, track, and fight. On the day her village was burned to the ground, Janneke—as the only survivor—was taken captive by the malicious Lydian and eventually sent to work for his nephew Soren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janneke’s survival in the court of merciless monsters has come at the cost of her connection to the human world. And when the Goblin King’s death ignites an ancient hunt for the next king, Soren senses an opportunity for her to finally fully accept the ways of the brutal Permafrost. But every action he takes to bring her deeper into his world only shows him that a little humanity isn’t bad—especially when it comes to those you care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through every battle they survive, Janneke’s loyalty to Soren deepens. After dangerous truths are revealed, Janneke must choose between holding on or letting go of her last connections to a world she no longer belongs to. She must make the right choice to save the only thing keeping both worlds from crumbling.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>Best. Summer. Ever. At least it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate can't wait to attend the elite girls' hockey camp in Denver and go up against some of the best players from around the world. But then Mom says Kate has to stay with her grandma in Denver, who doesn't care about Kate's hockey dreams at all. And two players at the camp have it in for Kate both on and off the ice. Toss in a tough-as-nails coach and a huge family secret, and Kate's perfect summer isn’t turning out quite like she planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate's Really Good at Hockey is a story about family, friendship, and doing what it takes to follow your dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sawkill Girls is a frightening stand-alone contemporary teen horror novel about three girls who take on an insidious monster that preys upon young women. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: The newbie. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: The pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: The queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives; a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires. Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight…until now.</description>

  <description>Following her time in the clutches of Darth Vader, Doctor Aphra has barely escaped with her life. If he ever learns of her survival, he'll hunt her to the ends of the galaxy. But for now, it's time for a return to what she does best. With the droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 in tow, she's off in search of rare artifacts from the galactic center to the Outer Rim and everywhere in between. Aphra's got debts to pay after all. Just as long as she can stay one step ahead of the Empire, some Bounty Hunters and just about everyone else in the galaxy! &lt;b&gt;COLLECTING: &lt;/b&gt;STAR WARS: DOCTOR APHRA 1-6</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From former Buzzfeed illustrator Adam Ellis comes a collection of autobiographical comics that follows a year in the artist’s life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam’s comics deal with weightier topics like seasonal affective disorder and struggles with self-esteem, while also touching on the silly and absurd—like his brief, but intense obsession with crystals. With a bright, positive outlook and a sense of humor, &lt;i&gt;Super Chill&lt;/i&gt; tells a story that is both highly relatable and intensely personal.</description>

  <description>Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meagre clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray—a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America—overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.</description>
