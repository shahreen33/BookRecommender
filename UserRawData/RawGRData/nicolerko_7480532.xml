  <description>&lt;b&gt;Her biggest mistake was arresting me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My biggest mistake was falling for her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's going to ruin two long, hard years of work within my club, and it's going to get her killed. To protect her, I'll have to keep her dangerously close. Close enough to run my rough hands down her smooth curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she's all business, but I can see her fierce, brown eyes wandering over my body. The sexual tension between us is stronger than the handcuffs she has me in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She'll never trust me. She shouldn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I'm not the criminal she thinks I am….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm so much worse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raw Deal, a motorcycle romance set in the Steel Veins Motorcycle Club, is filled with heat, nail-biting violence, and heart-racing adventure.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In darkness, we find danger. In danger, I find Beau.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash is a prison guard, she's tough, she's strong and she never backs away from a fight. She takes her job seriously, she takes her training seriously, and everything in her life goes as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day he is brought into the prison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She'll never forget meeting Beau 'Krypt' Dawson for the first time. She'll never forget his haunted eyes and his numb expression. He's a member of the Jokers Wrath MC and it is said he killed an innocent family in the middle of a cafe, in cold blood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deranged. Crazy. Psychotic.&lt;br /&gt;All those words describe the infamous Krypt, but Ash suspects there's far more to the quiet man than meets the eye. Secrets are being hidden by the club, information is being kept under wraps. Krypt is silent for a reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash is desperate to know that reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continually fighting, Krypt is transferred to a high security prison. Ash is in charge. She's always prepared, always alert. Not even her skills will stop the club from ambushing them and taking back Krypt. Only Ash ends up right in the middle of it. &lt;br /&gt;They take her, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's stuck with a Motorcycle Club who are tougher than any prisoner she's ever laid eyes on. And they won't let her go. She's too much of a risk. Until the situation can be sorted, they send her and Krypt into the mountains together....alone. &lt;br /&gt;An epic, dangerous love will be built on the foundations of darkness.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Intense</strong><br /><br />With amazing characters, smouldering heat, and a strong plot, Precarious is a fast-paced MC romance. Having such a confident heroine made such a refreshing difference to this genre. She kicked ass big time. It made the story so much more enjoyable.<br />]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Will he risk it all to be in safe arms?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a damaged man stumbles on a second chance, it's all too easy to turn and run. It takes a determined photographer to convince him risk is worth it all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People deserve a second chance, right? How about a third or fourth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if I can't even admit to myself who I am? I was truthful once before. I came out to one other person, and he left me broken and scarred. He destroyed the boy I was. I don't even use the same name anymore; I go by Trent now. But I survived the streets. I got lucky and I made something of myself. I'm happy, sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Angelo who lights up my life. He's my world. My rock and my family. He's always there for me. But I keep hurting him. I say stupid things, and I always keep him at a distance. Still, he knows me better than anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I want him. But I can't let myself go there. Not again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've lived in denial for so long and it's killing me. In my weakest moments, I reach for Angelo and when he slips into my arms, I can breathe. He's my solace. Selflessly, he's there and he never expects anything in return. No judgment, not even an explanation. Having him in my arms is everything, and it's getting harder to push him away. I'm not sure I want to anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn't date, but he deserves to be loved. Cherished. Then he drops a bombshell—he's found The One. I wish he'd fallen for me. I need that second chance to tell him. I need to risk it all because in his arms, I'm safe. I'm me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Escape with Leo and Zak in outback Australia as they discover it sometimes takes time, distance, and interfering family to amalgamate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five years of living in the UK, it's time for Leo to return home to his dad's stud farm in outback Australia. He has no idea what to expect when he arrives. He didn't exactly leave with balloons and banners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. His farewell involved destruction and his own heart split in two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows seeing the man who's always held his heart, Zak, is going to be awkward. The older farm manager made his feelings pretty damn clear when Leo hightailed it out of there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo quickly figures out life is going to get complicated and a whole heap more exciting as his trip home becomes so much more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amalgamated is a fun and steamy M/M short story in Becca Seymour's Coming Home series. Stand-alone romances complete with heat, wit, and happily ever afters.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When the kraliyet bodyguard ended up in her hospital bed after an explosion left him in critical condition, Nadia tried to warn herself not to fall in love with him. After all, she's no vampire Cinderella, and happily-ever-afters didn't happen to low-born females of the Kan Asma. But her heart wouldn't listen, and soon she wanted to claim Gunnar as her forever mate, even if it meant taking him the only way possible, as a husband in a disgraceful human ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;Gunnar fell in love with his nurse the moment he saw her smile. He yearned to claim her as his, but the Council would never allow him to mingle his powerful blood with a female from a poor family. The penalty for an unsanctioned mating is a death sentence. He doesn’t care about the threats and possible consequences of making her his. Though, due to the high probability of genetic incompatibility, he can't complete their blood-bond without knowing if it might take her life. Losing her would be worse than torture.&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope lies with the treasonous Faction hell-bent on destroying the very people Gunnar calls family. Determined to find a way to be mated, Gunnar seeks out the leader of this hidden uprising. Together, Nadia and Gunnar must break every law and rite of their vampire culture to become bonded for life. Gunnar will play a deadly game of subversion or pay a blood price that would sever him from their people and put a bounty on his head. They must survive a dangerous infiltration of the Faction, because they’ll do anything to be together, even if it means being mated in treason.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Fun</strong><br /><br />A creative, sometimes complicated world, Mated in Treason felt like I’d missed a prequel at times. This made it a little difficult to connect with the storyline and led me to chasing the dialogue so I could focus on the couple, who I really liked. ]]>

  <description>The vampire race is dying, and to save it, one vampire will risk his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vampire Reinis has been assigned to mate with a human to create a prophesied child that will save his coven. The rules are simple: get the job done and come home. Falling in love is out of the question. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet that's exactly what Reinis has unwittingly done. Now he risks execution at the hands of his own coven for breaking vampire law. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of a bad relationship, Sarma has no clue about the dark, seductive world Reinis is from. But when he marks her as his mate, she's thrown headfirst into a secret world of vampires...painting a target on her back with a rival coven that will do anything to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of Bella Forrest's A Shade of Vampire and Dannika Dark's Keystone will fall in love with this hot paranormal vampire romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scroll-up and one-click to sink your fangs into the sizzling and thrilling world of the Immortal Desire Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author's note: This is a series and each book features a couple that has a Happy For Now (HFN) or Happy Ever After (HEA). However, the novels are connected and there may be unanswered questions that connect to the next book. Happy reading!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if vampires were a superior species and nearly undetectable? As successful, influential individuals, vampires live under a strict set of rules created by their government, The Cardinalis Order. Are you ready to understand what it means to break The Cardinalis Code?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When successful business entrepreneur Michael Chamberlain arrives in The Hamptons to take over his father’s nightclub, he’s in search of a new donateur, a contracted blood source. Troubled and distant, Michael discovers he’s still very much alive when enticed by a beautiful woman, offering a kiss and a question. Can you be mine for five minutes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Student Paislee Sullivan serves at the prestigious nightclub to pay her tuition. When she meets the mysterious Michael Chamberlain, who she believes to be just a gorgeous bartender with an attitude, she soon discovers her world is ruled by a species not of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealth and glamour shroud a dark side that threatens her life when she signs Michael’s contract. In this steamy romance, two lovers wield a charming relationship that will be destroyed by the Order if she breaks just one rule.</description>

  <description>Halloween has passed, and winter is not far ahead, blanketing Flintlock in dreary, foreboding skies and an aura Prudence has never sensed in her sleepy town.&lt;br /&gt;Rumors and speculation about the poor spook-house boy and his little dead brother have begun to spread. Prudence--recovering from surgery--tries to shield Cassius, but it seems rumors are the least of their worries.&lt;br /&gt;When Cassius's mysteriously elusive neighbor makes himself known, the rules of the game are turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if cancer and my odd boy weren't enough, the secrets of Flintlock--the fallout of my death-defying bravery--are boiling over faster than I can manage.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Wrong! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Graham is taken by gunpoint from his store, Wes and his team are his only hope. The race is on to not only save his friend, but to save the man he loves.</description>

  <description>What happens when an out-and-proud bear moves to a small Tennessee town, and takes a shine to the closeted cop? &lt;br /&gt;Fireworks, that’s what. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Del Walters agrees to go into business with his brother, he has one condition. Since he’s putting up the lion’s share, they’ll run the bike shop his way—and that means he gets to choose the name. And in a small Tennessee town, a business called Rainbow Racers, complete with a not-so-subtle sign, was always going to attract attention. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it’s the wrong kind of attention, and after a few incidents, Del is forced to call on the local police to deal with the culprits. &lt;br /&gt;When Officer Taylor Cox walks into his shop, Del thinks Christmas has come early. An earlier encounter with the younger man left Del with a growing desire to know more about him. There’s only one problem—Taylor is in the closet, and there’s no way Del is going back into his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Taylor lays eyes on the sexy bear who owns the bike shop, he knows he’s walking into trouble. Not that he’s about to let Del know he’s interested: his view from the closet is just fine, thank you very much, and besides, that ship has already sailed, thanks to their first meeting. Now all he wants to do is forget Del even exists. But as time goes by, Taylor realizes how badly he is torn between protecting the persona he’s created, and giving in to his desires. And Del making it obvious that he wants Taylor isn’t helping matters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between an out-and-proud bear and a firmly closeted cop, something has to give. Problem is, it might be their hearts. &lt;br /&gt;*age gap &lt;br /&gt;*first time &lt;br /&gt;</description>

And can they make a new family for themselves? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book is over 60,000 words of sweet, sexy romance with a happy ending you’ll love! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s been broken by life. He’s always had it easy. Can they trust each other enough to be the fix they both need?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wonder if there was something wrong with me, but there was &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; wrong with me. I’m a happy, well-adjusted, laid-back guy, or so I always thought. The reality, though, is I’ve been coasting through life, not thinking or feeling, just &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until everything goes wrong, and Emi comes crashing into my life in the worst way possible. Yet for all the drama, angst, and heartache she brings with her, she’s also shown me what it means to be human—to feel, love, and hurt. She’s taught me what it meant to be alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s so fragile, yet she’s also the strongest person I know—a true survivor. She’s been to hell and back but wakes up every morning ready to fight another day. &lt;br /&gt;And when tragedy strikes and my perfect world falls apart, she’s the one helping me pick up the pieces. Yet each time she needs me to be there for her, she pushes me away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I refuse to just walk away. She’s taught me that real life isn’t easy, and if something’s worth wanting, it’s worth fighting for.</description>

In Sheila Kell’s thrilling novel of deception and second chances, two operatives embark on a dangerous journey that will test them as agents, friends, and lovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time and distance hasn’t impacted Ken “Boss” Patrick’s love for Samantha “Sugar” Milton.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In New York Times Bestselling author Nalini Singh’s newest contemporary romance, passion ignites between a gorgeous, sinfully sexy man who built himself up from nothing and a shy woman who has a terrible secret in her past…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy businessman Gabriel Bishop rules the boardroom with the same determination and ruthlessness that made him a rock star on the rugby field. He knows what he wants, and he’ll go after it no-holds-barred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what he wants is Charlotte Baird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte knows she’s a mouse. Emotionally scarred and painfully shy, she just wants to do her job and remain as invisible as possible. But the new CEO—a brilliant, broad-shouldered T-Rex of a man who growls and storms through the office, leaving carnage in his wake—clearly has other plans. Plans that may be equal parts business and bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Charlotte intends to survive this battle of wits and hearts, the mouse will have to learn to wrangle the T-Rex. Game on.</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Haru Ono has been in love with his stepbrother Aiden Davis since he was in middle school. Trying to keep his feelings under wraps is annoyingly hard when they’re living under the same roof in such close proximity, more so since Aiden is so caring and selflessly showers him with kindness.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haru knows that family is important to Aiden, who has been shouldering the burden of raising five younger siblings, and it’s best Haru never reveals his feelings to Aiden. Then again, an eighteen-year-old boy with raging hormones can only bottle up so much until everything starts to burst.  </description>

  <description>Blue: When my ex walks into the resort bar with his new husband on his arm, I want nothing more than to prove to him that I've moved on. Thankfully, the sexy stranger sitting next to me is more than willing to share a few kisses in the name of revenge. It gets even better when those scorching kisses turn into a night of fiery passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem? Turns out the stranger's brother is marrying my sister later this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristan: I have one rule: no messing with the guests at my vineyard resort. Of course the one exception I make turns out to be the brother of the woman my brother's about to marry. Now we're stuck together for a week of wedding activities, and there's no avoiding the heat burning between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fine, we make a deal: one week. One week to enjoy each other's bodies and get it out of our system. Once the bride and groom say I do and we become family, it'll all be over between us. Right? &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Blue and Tristan's story contains smoking hot scenes of man parts touching, pee-in-pants descriptions of grannies cursing, and the sweet improbability of two strangers finding their happily ever after when they least expect it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With a serial killer on the loose, the baffling mystery of Aiden’s past, and their tenuous budding romance, Aiden and Fouchard tread through a world of magic and myth on padded shoes, terrified to stir up something neither can control or defeat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aiden Mercer’s life now centers around lounging on the sunny beaches of his adopted country with a beer in one hand and a coffee in the other while admiring the local male population. After a rough life as a respected detective in DC, playing it cool shouldn’t be too hard, right? With the magical community on his case and dead bodies piling up around town, the responsibility of finding their killer seems fated to fall on him and deny him of his easy living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there is Naël.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cantankerous merman Naël Fouchard's life is focused on bringing up and protecting his little sister. When DNA found at the scene of the murders mark him as the prime suspect, Naël seeks out the help of Aiden, whose reputation as a detective grossly belies his lazy lifestyle and apparent lack of ambition.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between the strong, stoic Naël and the easygoing Aiden is undeniable, no matter how many walls Aiden builds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If this unlikely pair can’t come to terms with their feelings for each other long enough to catch the killer, their emotional turmoil might yet allow the murderer to kill them instead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One day you’ll be pumping my gas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Miller’s life has gone to shit. The formerly popular high school quarterback now works at a gas station in the middle of nowhere. The last thing he needs is meeting the guy he used to bully at school and seeing him all sorts of polished up. James is now the proud owner of an amazing silver Jaguar and a self-made millionaire. It seems that the day couldn’t get any worse for Mike, but James ‘Lovelace’ Austin might just turn out to be his golden ticket out of the job he hates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When James Austin meets Mike Miller, his high school crush and tormentor all in one, working at an old, dirty gas station, it feels as if the stars have finally aligned in his favor. He wants to finally get his revenge on the guy, but when Mike turns out to be gay, the whole afternoon takes a turn for the surreal. Instead of just humiliating Mike at his workplace, James decides to hire him for a weekend at a conference he’s attending. A hot guy by his side is the only accessory James needs to rub his success in the faces of his frenemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, a gay Mike Miller might be too much of a blast from the past than James ever expected. If James wants his nerdy heart safe from the hunky jock, he needs to keep Mike at arms length. The task would be a lot easier if Mike wasn’t unashamedly hitting on James. Or is it just James’s money Mike is after?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She should never have stayed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should never have kept her.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad guys like me? We crave violence, danger, and someone warm in our beds.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone like her? She is beautiful and surprisingly strong.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But saving her was a mistake for the both of us. It would have been easier if I'd let my MC kill her when they were getting revenge on her uncle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now it's too late.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don't want sympathy or forgiveness.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just want her.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blow Out, a motorcycle romance set in the Steel Veins Motorcycle Club, is filled with heat, nail-biting violence, and heart-racing adventure. Blow Out has been reedited, packaged, and is complete with NEW material. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Holden Russell let his job consume his life for too long, and it took his wife leaving for him to realize it’s time for a change. His marriage is over, but he’s determined to do right by his kids, starting with fewer hours at work and more with them. Except it’s no longer the kids competing with his job for his attention. It’s Holden competing for their attention… with their new live-in nanny. Their very hot male live-in nanny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porter Blake never saw himself becoming a nanny, but okay. After burnout and PTSD drove him from his job as a paramedic, he’s desperate for something new, and it turns out the nanny gig isn’t so bad. The pay is decent, the stress is manageable, the kids are great, and their mom is cool. It’s the ex-husband he’s not so sure about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation is awkward enough when Porter and Holden are butting heads. When they find some common ground and their mutual attraction becomes too much to ignore, things are bound to get complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unless they want Porter to lose his job, they’re going to have to fly under the ex-wife’s radar. Except secrets like this have a way of coming out…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This standalone novel is approximately 115,000 words long.</description>

  <description>Christopher Rush is not gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But after a breakup with his longtime girlfriend, he finds himself crossing swords with his best friend Jeremy Pratt. Who’s also not … gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a one-time thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It didn’t mean anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They like girls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what these boys of summer tell themselves as they pretend it wasn’t more than experimentation. With only four weeks left before they leave town for college, Christopher and Jeremy awkwardly navigate their way through a series of unfortunate (or very fortunate) events. Often leaving them breathless, conflicted, and dressed in nothing but a pair of socks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because socks are less gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As their time together comes to an end, will Christopher and Jeremy accept that love doesn’t discriminate, or will they put their swords up for good? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[An okay read that was weirdly sweet, but left me wishing for something more. I wish I had gone into this book blind. I heard so much fabulous buzz that meant I was expecting something... I don’t know... more.<br />The character dynamics, the constant beating us other up, to be honest confused me...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He'll love him in any lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil isn’t a ghost, but he feels like one. Reincarnated with all his memories from his prior life, he spent twenty years trapped in a child’s body, wanting nothing more than to grow up and reclaim the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Neil finds there's more than lost time separating them. Joshua has built a beautiful life since Neil’s death, and how exactly is Neil supposed to introduce himself? As Joshua's long-dead lover in a new body? Heartbroken and hopeless, Neil takes refuge in his work, developing microscopic robots called nanites that can produce medical miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Joshua meets a young scientist working on a medical project, his soul senses something his rational mind can't believe. Has Neil truly come back to him after twenty years? And if the impossible is real, can they be together at long last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any Given Lifetime&lt;/i&gt; is a gay romance by Leta Blake featuring reincarnation and true love. This story includes some angst, some steam, and, of course, a happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A bitter lone wolf &lt;br /&gt;An angry Alpha &lt;br /&gt;A kidnapping gone wrong &lt;br /&gt;A cult planning to end shifterkind...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tegan&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being kidnapped wasn't on my list of things to do tonight, but seeing as my life was already halfway down the shitter? Why not? I have no family. No pack. No home. No one will miss me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, the very ticked off Alpha wolf who's taken me hostage? Just happens to be my fated mate. I hate him. I want him. Lust is complicated when all you want to do is gouge his eyes out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even if we mated, he won't want me once he sees the brand on my chest. I'm marked. Hunted. A danger to him and his pack...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad I'm too selfish to walk away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finding Home is a 34,000 word paranormal romance, and the first book in the Northpoint Wolves series. There are mpreg elements in later books, and this series is a bit darker than my usual fare, but there is a guaranteed HEA for all my couples. See author's note for list of triggers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Catch up with Kirkby residents Scott and Davis as they navigate through the ups and downs of fatherhood, relationships, and juggling... balls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two years, it's clear love can last, just as it can grow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davis's business remains successful, Scott's clinic is going strong, and Libby is happy and content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that doesn't mean real life is always perfect, nor does it mean fatherhood isn't as exhausting as it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needing a break from their daily routines, Davis and Scott head away for a weekend of uninhibited fun. With lots of laughter and dancing, Davis has never seen Scott so relaxed and comfortable in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he's not quite sure how to handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried that life in Kirkby is holding Scott back, Davis nearly makes the biggest mistake of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Scott has other ideas. He doesn't need saving. What he needs is his man to step up and fight for their family and their future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he has just the plan to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A True-Blue novella. I've Got You MUST be read prior to reading this story.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once the line is crossed, every penalty is major.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dalek "Taz" Tazandlakova is the epitome of a hockey player—tall, broad, and powerful. As a forward for the Lafayette Ice Water Moccasins, he's also the physical embodiment of domination and intimidation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's everything Liam Jolivet isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam possesses an inner strength and confidence Taz has never mastered. On the surface, Liam appears to be a perfect match for Taz. The problem is, Liam is dating Taz’s roommate. It’s not the only problem, either. Taz is a “playa” and has commitment issues—along with a pain-in-the-ass coach who's threatening to ruin his career, and a second roommate who wants to dictate his social life for his own personal gain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, Taz wants Liam, and Liam appears to want to reciprocate. Do they dare cross the line?</description>

  <description>Gloomy teenager Manee Srikwan wears long sleeves and keeps her hands to herself for a good reason–whenever she touches a person for the first time, she sees a vision of how they will die. Manee’s weird powers cause those around her nothing but misery and she’s long resigned herself to a life of loneliness. But her vivacious classmate, Stephanie Pierce, changes all that. She smashes through every wall Manee puts up and overturns every expectation. Much to Manee’s shock, Stephanie believes her about her powers. What’s more, she insists they can stop the deaths Manee sees from happening. When the two of them are together, it feels like they can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the girls grow closer, Manee’s feelings for Stephanie blossom into love. She yearns to be more intimate but is anxious about breaking her all-important “hands-off ” rule. When she finally gives in to temptation, she sees a terrifying future where Stephanie is murdered — and Manee is her killer! Now Manee has a choice to make— will she fight this fate or let it rule her?</description>

  <description>When a brutal attack from a jealous competitor leaves Noah Strauss, darling of the modeling world, physically scarred and emotionally damaged, he quits the runway to become a psychologist. Using his contacts from his time in the spotlight, he creates One Call Away, a radio show dedicated to gay men looking for love, advice or someone to talk to. But with secrets of his own and a mother who refuses to understand the career path he's chosen, the one person Noah can't seem to help is himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a drunken dare from the senior partner's grandson, Oren Leavitt calls Noah’s radio show, pretending to be gay. Only Oren isn't certain if he's pretending. He's left his strict Orthodox Jewish upbringing behind, but the guilt remains. Guilt that his actions have prevented his sister from finding a husband and guilt that he's failed his parents. Talking to "Dr. Noah" helps, and as he finds himself calling the man again and again, he knows he must be honest. But Oren is unsure if he's lying to Noah or himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Noah, trust is paramount; he's been deceived in his personal and professional life and while he desperately wants to help Oren, he also finds himself falling for the sweet and tortured man. Oren is trapped: he risks losing his job and more importantly the love and security of his family but knows he can't hide if he wants to be with Noah. When unresolved heartaches from the past rise up to control the present, Noah and Oren discover that love often comes from the most unexpected places, and sometimes a call for help not only saves a life, it can be a new and beautiful beginning.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Storm MC are back and war is coming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nitro’s Torment takes the Storm MC to a new level. Dark, gritty and fast-paced, this book is an adrenaline ride right to the very last page.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tatum Lee is a pain in my ass. &lt;br /&gt;She’s stubborn, full of attitude, and she doesn’t like to do what she’s told. &lt;br /&gt;And yet, at a time when I should be focusing on the war my club is at, she consumes my mind because she’s also fearless and fierce, and I’ve never met a woman like her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing about war, though, is the minute you let your focus drop, your enemy rises up and attacks. And sometimes they bring you to your knees in ways you never imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other thing about war? You learn just what you’re capable of doing to protect those you love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone lies.  When working for a sex mage, it's the only way to stay safe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's the first thing Jaeda learns when she's named as the Chosen.  The mage needs a sacrifice, and she's willing to give it.  Maybe too willing.  After all, this man is lust incarnate; a woman would have to be insane not to want him, even if he is dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But desiring someone's body is very different from falling in love.  In her line of work, the two must never be confused.  She doesn't even know his name!  He's simply The Jackal, a terrifyingly powerful sex mage, and she's his altar.  Her lust fuels him.  He needs it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that puts her in control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, she gets to spend her days with a mage who wields sex like a weapon and his assistant who's as irresistible as some long-lost god brought to life.  The things they do to her body are amazing, and the rest? These men want to spoil her with the kind of riches she's always dreamed of.  It's the best job she can imagine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it's never that easy.  This is supposed to be about making magic - that's it.  Feelings have no place in a mage's temple.  Affection is a curse.  But when the enemy decides she'll make the perfect weapon to steal the Jackal's power, what's she supposed to do?  After all, she's just a stupid girl caught in the middle.  Her job is to just lie back and take it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except, someone's been lying. &lt;br /&gt;It might even be her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;POWER OF LIES&lt;/b&gt; is a complete novel with a reverse harem, polyamorous story line.  It is intended for a mature audience due to the presence of consensual sex, group sex, M/M scenes, and plenty of vulgar language - as well as some potentially triggering violence since the bad guys don't always play nice.  While this is a love story, it may not be right for all readers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Erik Keston, son of the Keston Real Estate empire, knows what it takes to be successful. Despite his inherent wealth, he holds his own. He works hard, he’s grounded, he’s brilliant. He’s also secretly in love with his best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Monroe Wellman lost his parents three years ago and never grieved, never recovered. Inheriting the family company and wealth means nothing, and his spiral of self-destruction is widespread and spectacular. Dubbed Sydney’s bad boy, he spends more days drunk than sober, and the only person who’s stuck by him through it all is his best mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Monroe hits rock bottom, Erik gives him an ultimatum, and his entire world comes to a grinding halt. It’s not until the haze lifts that Monroe can truly see what he’s been searching for was never in the bottom of a bottle. It’s been by his side all along. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An 80,000-word friends-to-lovers story about fighting the demons within and trusting in the love that takes its place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Because when all you drink is hate, that’s all there is inside you.”&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This edition is out of print. For current Kindle edition see: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48729875.Murmuration" title="Murmuration" rel="nofollow"&gt;Murmuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small mountain town of Amorea, it’s stretching toward autumn of 1954. The memories of a world at war are fading in the face of a prosperous future. Doors are left unlocked at night, and neighbors are always there to give each other a helping hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The people here know certain things as fact: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amorea is the best little town there is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only good Commie is a dead Commie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Women’s Club of Amorea runs the town with an immaculately gloved fist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And bookstore owner Mike Frazier loves that boy down at the diner, Sean Mellgard. Why they haven’t gotten their acts together is anybody’s guess. It may be the world’s longest courtship, but no one can deny the way they look at each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slow and steady wins the race, or so they say. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But something’s wrong with Mike. He hears voices in his house late at night. There are shadows crawling along the walls and great clouds of birds overhead that only he can see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Something’s happening in Amorea. And Mike will do whatever he can to keep the man he loves.</description>

  <description>For the past eight years, master mechanic Remington Grain has been tirelessly working toward his dream job of becoming a member of an NHRA pit crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being the new guy is never easy. Not only is he at the bottom of the totem pole, he’s pretty sure his crew chief hates him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remy knows anything worth having takes hard work and dedication. As he slowly tries to earns the trust of his crew chief, Remy falls for the new girl in town, and without him knowing it, she steals his heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is lining up, almost clear to the finish line of capturing her heart just as she has won his, when Remy figures out who Harlyn Krinston is. She may be the thing to make his whole world pause and delay the race he’s been on to create the career he’s always envisioned. Will Remy have the reaction time it takes to win Harlyn’s heart, or will he foul start before the race even begins?</description>

  <description>Levi Binder is a Miami bartender who cares about only two things: sex and surfing. Ostracized by his Mormon family for his homosexuality, Levi is determined to live his life his own way, but everything changes when he meets massage therapist Jaime Marshall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaime is used to being alone. Haunted by the horrors of his past, his only friend is his faithful dog, Dolly. He has no idea how to handle somebody as gorgeous and vibrant as Levi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete opposites on the surface, Levi and Jaime both long for something that they can only find together. Through love and the therapeutic power of touch, they’ll find a way to heal each other, and they’ll learn to live as sinners in a family of saints.</description>

  <description>Dr. Samantha Moore is one of the youngest and most acclaimed researchers in the world. Her specialty is blood and she has been recruited by the largest pharmaceutical company in Scotland. For what purpose she cannot begin to imagine, but in an attempt to break out of her painfully shy shell, she throws caution to the wind and leaves her family and best friend behind in Savannah. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kade Gunnach is taking a chance hiring an outsider, but he’s desperate to find out how to help his sister. He believes the key lies in her blood, but so far, no one has found the answers. When the new researcher walks into his office, he’s unprepared for his reaction to her and the life-changing ramifications her arrival brings. They’re drawn together by a force neither is prepared for, but Kade is holding something back. Something that could scare her away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Samantha learns his secret, will she run? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Kade be able to live with the answers he’s been desperately searching for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A witch outrunning her past. Five smoldering-hot guardians. And the dark secret that could destroy them all… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blackmoon Bay is a city of monsters. Surviving here means never leaving home without a sharp stake. It means keeping secrets, even from friends. And unless I want the Hunters finding me again, it means my witchcraft stays on lockdown—permanently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First time I fumble? Three witches get murdered for my mistake—including my best friend. Now I’m hunting a killer, and the magic I’ve snooze-buttoned for years is quickly making up for lost time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And attracting dangerous allies... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asher, the bad-boy incubus. Darius, the all-too-tempting vampire. Emilio, the wolf shifter with a big heart and a treacherous past. Ronan, the only demon I trust with my soul. And Death himself, drawn to my magic for reasons I don’t understand.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together they’ve sworn to protect me from the evil out there, but even with a killer on the loose, it’s not the evil out &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt; that scares me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A shadow lurks inside me, black and deadly as a bomb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I’m pretty sure my magical mishap just lit the fuse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m Gray Desario. Witch. Survivor. Occasional bringer of chaos. And tonight? The darkness is coming…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;SHADOW KISSED is the first book in The Witch’s Rebels, a steamy reverse harem paranormal romance and urban fantasy series featuring five smoldering-hot guys and the kickass witch they’d kill to protect. If you like sexy forbidden romance, dark magic, and heart-pounding supernatural suspense, Sarah Piper’s witchy new series will leave you spellbound.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>One click. &lt;br /&gt;One perfect frame. &lt;br /&gt;That's all it takes to capture an eternal moment; although most people let them pass by without acknowledgement. &lt;br /&gt;I don't waste any. &lt;br /&gt;Not a single one. &lt;br /&gt;If I see something of beauty, I want to experience it, feel it and immortalise it. &lt;br /&gt;If I see someone of beauty, I want to taste them, worship them and memorise them. &lt;br /&gt;I don't have a type, if I like you, I like you. &lt;br /&gt;I don't have a preference. &lt;br /&gt;My bisexuality is a gift, not a defect. &lt;br /&gt;It's the freedom to see beyond gender. &lt;br /&gt;One blink. &lt;br /&gt;One touch. &lt;br /&gt;One night. &lt;br /&gt;Life is filled with so many ones. &lt;br /&gt;One chance to get things right. &lt;br /&gt;One life to live as you choose. &lt;br /&gt;One decision that gives you acceptance. &lt;br /&gt;One person to fill the emptiness. &lt;br /&gt;Just one? &lt;br /&gt;Nah, like I said, life is full of ones. &lt;br /&gt;My camera lets me focus on the good times; I develop from life's negatives, and if things don't work out, I just take another shot. &lt;br /&gt;Who needs just one? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book #5 in the 'Love by Numbers' series. &lt;br /&gt;Can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>His world was water and rhythm. Hard work and drive kept Royal O'Connell one step ahead of his competition. His spot on the swim team, keeping his scholarship, was the only plan that mattered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His world was ebony and ivory. Natural talent and ambition set Camden Morgan apart from the other music majors. His dedication scoring him a full ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, their paths would have never crossed….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Royal meets his best friend's new roommate, his big plan and Camden’s controlled environment faces a variable that could destroy it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attraction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world they live in had no room for error. That undeniable pull between them was dangerous and neither one of them could've prepared for the choice they'd have to make. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love isn't always an easy road and, when everything they've worked for is on the line, they'll have to decide if being together is worth the risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let There Be Light is a full-length standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>She’s supposed to cover the stories. &lt;br /&gt;Not be one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Madison Winters has life in the bag. Gorgeous fiancé? Check. Promotion to become editor of the country’s hottest fashion magazine? Check. Limited edition pair of Manolo Blahniks? Checkity-check. &lt;br /&gt;Catching her fiancé with his pants down isn’t something she expects. In the space of twenty-four hours, Madison loses it all—not even her shoes will be saved. &lt;br /&gt;Swapping sass + bide for sweatpants and Dior for the downward dog is going to be hell. The last thing Madison’s broken heart needs is a run-in with America’s newest playboy. Can she ever recover from this? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tate Masters has it all—Hollywood’s latest golden boy has washboard abs, a killer smile, and a leading role in the next A-list movie. &lt;br /&gt;Until a secret from his past is splashed all over the headlines, and that ‘good boy’ image fast-tracks to the gutter. &lt;br /&gt;Now the media hunt is on, and they’re baying for Tate’s blood. One night of wild behaviour sees him wake up next to a gorgeous Aussie brunette—and she’s everything Tate’s afraid of. &lt;br /&gt;Keeping secrets has never been this hard. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Mirror, mirror … who’s the fairest of them all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still cringe when I hear that line. A fairy tale that had girls pretending &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; were the fairest, the most beautiful, and the most entitled. A fairy tale most couldn’t grow out of turned my haunted childhood memories into a living nightmare. Girls who grew up believing that pile of garbage became the meanest of all ‘mean girls.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And those mean girls were right – it was a line meant for all the beautiful people in the world – and I knew the answer would never be &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women with long legs, flat stomachs, and perfect chests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type of women Kane Masters gravitated toward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that’s definitely not Willow Tate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. That will &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I’m completely imperfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And … I hate myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what Kane could possibly see in someone like &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; when he could have &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Rosabel McGuiness, orphaned Werewolf, has finally decided to leave the Werelion Pride she’s been living with for the last 18 years. She’s been challenged to one duel too many. It’s time to find a pack to call home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Theodore Wilson, Alpha of the Mount Roxby Pack, has never cared about finding his Mate. He swore off women when his Wife, a human who knew nothing about what he was, cheated on him. But now a new wolf has walked into town, and stirred up feelings he never imagined he would feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mount Roxby has a plethora of supernatural beings, unbeknownst to the humans that live there. After a series of mysterious disappearances, and fatal attacks on both Werewolves and Vampires alike, Rosabel decides something needs to be done. But can she persuade the Pack Alpha and Vampire King, to put old prejudices behind them long enough to work together, and solve these attacks? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or will one bite too many cause a war?</description>

  <description>Freshman Lianne Challice is known to millions of fans as Princess Vindi. But sometimes a silver screen sorceress just wants to hang up her wand, tell her manager to shove it, and become a normal college student. Too bad that’s harder than it looks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s never lived a normal life. She hasn’t been to school since kindergarten. And getting close to anyone is just too risky — the last boy she kissed sold the story to a British tabloid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she can’t resist trying to get close to Daniel "DJ" Trevi, the hot, broody guy who spins tunes for hockey games in the arena. Something's haunting his dark eyes, and she needs to know more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DJ's genius is for expressing the mood of the crowd with a ten second song snippet. With just a click and a fade, he can spread hope, pathos or elation among six thousand screaming fans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad his college career is about to experience the same quick fade-out as one of his songs. He can't get close to Lianne, and he can't tell her why. And the fact that she seems to like him at all? Incredible.</description>

  <description>Experience Declan’s complete story. Includes RONE-nominated novella “Decide” and an exclusive bonus novella “Decode”. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As high school sweethearts, Declan Reede and Alyssa Dawson didn’t always see eye-to-eye. Especially when it came to his dream of being a driver in the ProV8 series. When he’s offered the chance at the career of his dreams, Declan straps himself in for the ride regardless of the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Older, but not wiser, Declan is on the path to becoming a racing legend. Only, regret haunts him around the track and threatens to send him off-course. When a chance encounter offers the opportunity to correct his mistakes, Declan must learn to manage the curves if he wants to claim the ultimate prize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Due to strong language and sexual content not intended for anyone under the age of 18**</description>

  <description>She’s everything he’s never wanted. He’s everything she’s never known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Cole is a force to be reckoned with. As Vice President of the Storm Motorcycle Club he carries out his duties with a ruthless determination. He moves through life with a clear agenda - protect his club and his family at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is loyal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is fierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t give his love easily, but when he does, he loves fiercely. Settling down, however, has never been part of his plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlow James is a country girl who has never met a biker in her life. She is also done with men. In her experience all they ever do is lie, cheat or steal. When she meets Scott Cole she knows he is heartbreak on legs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is bossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows she must fight her growing attraction to this complex man in order to guard her heart. When his world crashes into hers and danger comes calling, Scott’s fierce desire to protect kicks in and Harlow realises that she might just have found a man worth taking a risk on.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When two young Amish men find love, will they risk losing everything?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world where every detail of life—down to the width of a hat brim—is dictated by God and the all-powerful rules of the community, two men dare to imagine a different way. At 18, Isaac Byler knows little outside the strict Amish settlement of Zebulon, Minnesota, where there is no rumspringa for exploration beyond the boundaries of their insular world. Isaac knows he’ll have to officially join the church and find a wife before too long, but he yearns for something else—something he can’t name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dark tragedy has left carpenter David Lantz alone to support his mother and sisters, and he can’t put off joining the church any longer. But when he takes on Isaac as an apprentice, their attraction grows amid the sweat and sawdust. David shares his sinful secrets, and he and Isaac struggle to reconcile their shocking desires with their commitment to faith, family and community. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that they’ve found each other, are they willing to lose it all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: Contains explicit sexual situations and graphic language. This is not an inspirational/Christian romance.</description>

  <description>Tom Langley and Sean Goods work together in a human-and-wolf shifter partnership, assisting the police, rushing in to solve crimes wherever their bosses send them. They're a great team, and they have fun together, too: joking and enjoying each other's company in a way that doesn't happen every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom is also a married man. And his husband hates the wolf shifter with a passion. Tom tries to balance the sides of his life—one minute on a high-pressure chase with Sean, the next placating his husband Lowell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the unthinkable happens: his marriage ends. Heartbroken, he's not expecting to ever get over Lowell's betrayal or to be able to love again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean offers a solution: sex as friends. They have chemistry, and they trust each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can they change their partnership that much? And is Sean secretly harboring feelings for him—expecting more than just sex?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean is a loveable, funny, strong, and protective. He's the best buddy a guy could have. But Tom might not be able to keep from breaking his heart—if Sean is in love with him, and Tom can't love him back.</description>

  <description>I met Sarah Kate Erickson when I was twenty-one years old. I was lucky enough to keep her for seven years before a tragic accident stole her from me. She didn’t die, but sometimes I think it would have been easier if she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lived in a haze for those four years after the accident. Catering to her every need, even though she hated the very sight of my face. I tried to hold on to her and the future that we were supposed to build together. But you can’t hold on to someone who doesn’t exist anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t until I met Jesse Addison, a barista at the local coffee shop, that I realized I didn’t just lose Sarah that tragic night, I lost myself as well. Jesse taught me how to let go of the past and learn to love again. But what happens when your past haunts your present, and the woman you used to love refuses to accept the woman you can’t live without?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Intended for readers 18+. Each book in this series can be read as a standalone.*&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Benny DeMarco is the nicest guy you’ll ever meet. He works hard, takes care of his little sister, and pays the bills. Childhood bullies and an abusive stepfather invade his dreams, and at times he wishes life would grant him a do-over. Would he like a boyfriend? You bet. But Benny knows love isn’t for him. He’s been looked over, looked through, and looked past all his life. Even worse, the one guy he’s been in love with for almost two years is the biggest flirt who will sleep with anyone. Anyone except Benny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gino Acosta smiles to keep from crying. Everyone he meets tells him he’s beautiful and sexy, but Gino knows the truth. His outside may be perfect, but inside he feels dirty and unworthy. Bounced around as a child, he yearns for someone to love and a family to call his own. He hops from man to man, desperate to belong, believing the lies he’s told, but all he finds is a body for an hour or two. Things would be so different if only he knew—the man he’s searching for is waiting for him, right under his nose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Benny starts dating the “perfect guy”and it’s okay if there’s no spark—that’ll happen eventually. Won’t it? Gino’s fast-paced modeling career has taken off, but once again, he’s trading his body for a dream. When Gino’s world explodes, Benny must fight for what and who he really wants. Gino must learn to trust what people tell him—that he’s got so much more to offer than a pretty face and a moment of pleasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If all your life you believe you’re nothing, how do you move past heartbreak and hardship to reach for everything?</description>

      <![CDATA[With troubled, damaged characters, at times this book was both moving and challenging. The author handles the characters’ experiences with delicacy, and presents their relationship in a sweet and interesting way.<br />The novel is a little slow moving and on occasion the plot is a tad repetitive....]]>

  <description>Running naked through the woods, Cal flees the sadistic man who abducted and tortured him. When he stumbles upon a convenience store, he breaks in to steal food. A young store clerk, Jake, confronts him, and they get into a fight that ends with Cal being knocked unconscious. He wakes in the home of Jake’s Uncle Gary, the owner of the convenience store. Realizing Cal needs help, Gary tries to communicate with him, but despite Cal’s efforts, he can’t bring himself to speak. Instead, he writes down his experiences. Horrified by the perverse cruelty Cal endured, Gary takes him to the police, who track down his tormentor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by his parents before his abduction, Cal doesn’t have anywhere to go, so Gary and his wife eagerly welcome him into their home. He feels fortunate to be with such caring people—something he’s never had before. Despite their help, he still can’t find his voice, and he wonders if he ever will. And Jake certainly isn’t making things any easier. It’s clear he doesn’t want Cal to be part of their family. But the more Cal gets to know him, the more he realizes Jake might be the very person who can heal the deep wounds left by his horrifying past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jordan and Jamie’s love is anything but typical.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan Cameron is not like most nineteen year olds. He’s never been on a date, he’s never left New England, and he’s never fallen in love. He lives in his own world, or so that's what it seems to the average person. No one, not even his thirty-one year old brother, Tim, has ever given him the chance to break free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a schizophrenic mother in a group home and a career-obsessed absent father, Tim does the best he can raising someone with Jordan’s challenging behaviors. Despite Jordan’s diagnosis, Tim refuses to label him because “labels make us less than human.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty year old Jamie Perron has a history of bad relationships. After his girlfriend kicks him out this last time, his friend, Tim, lets him move in for the summer before embarking on a ten month teaching stint in London. Jamie changes everything Jordan has ever known. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music is the driving force that draws Jordan and Jamie together. With a similar taste in music, Jamie understands Jordan when no one else does. Never did Jamie think he would develop such an intense, romantic relationship with a strange, quiet, and sullen (yet cute) nineteen year old boy through the course of one interesting summer. Jamie changes everything Jordan has ever known. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is the summer of Jordan’s sexual awakening.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On acres and acres of land in the beautiful countryside of Northeastern Massachusetts, Jordan learns to love, Jamie learns how to be loved, and Tim learns how to let go.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She should never have stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should never have kept her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad guys like me? We crave violence, danger, and someone warm in our beds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone like her? She is beautiful and surprisingly strong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But saving her was a mistake for both of us. It would have been easier if I'd let my MC kill her when they were getting revenge on her uncle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't want sympathy or forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blow Out, a motorcycle romance set in the Steel Veins Motorcycle Club, is filled with heat, nail-biting violence, and heart-racing adventure. Blow Out has been reedited, packaged, and is complete with NEW material. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Shadow Valley where the Dirty Angels MC rule. Get ready to get Down &amp;amp; Dirty because this is Zak’s story…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending the last ten years in prison, Zak, former DAMC president, has a few priorities: to reconnect with his “brothers,” to get drunk, and to get laid. Not necessarily in that order. When he spots a stunning woman in the clubhouse and mistakes her for one of the club’s strippers, those priorities get a bit skewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie has no idea what happened to her life. One minute she’s totally focused on building her bakery business, and the next? She’s delivering a cake to the Dirty Angels motorcycle club’s “homecoming” celebration for a member who just got out of prison. Little does she know baking that cake will change the rest of her life, not to mention, make her a target for a rival MC. Normally, Sophie wouldn’t be caught dead with a man like Zak, a tattooed, ex-con, badassed biker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a decades old territory war threatens to rip them apart, Zak will do anything to keep Sophie, his club, and the town safe. But being from two different worlds, the threat they’re under may not be worth the risk.</description>

  <description>Dr. Paul Johnston can't get a set of dark, somber eyes out of his head, and the timing couldn't be worse.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing he needs is to fall for a patient. Not now, when he's been put on paid leave pending review of a formal complaint. One that accuses him of sexual impropriety of some kind. It's possible he let his newfound freedom as a divorced, out-of-the-closet gay man go to his head, but he's certain -- mostly -- he didn't do anything wrong. Now, he's struggling to handle the reality that his job is in danger and the only guy he wants should be off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane Kavanaugh is floundering, and there's only one man who soothes the storm inside him.&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from an assault that landed him in the hospital and the painful estrangement from his family since coming out, Zane is trying to get his feet under him. He moves in with a roommate and searches for a job, all while recovering from a fractured arm and cracked ribs. None of that hurts as much as the emotional damage he's suffered. When he connects with Dr. Paul Johnston outside of the ER, he's drawn to the man's calm, collected manner. It doesn't hurt that Paul's lack of experience with men is sexy as hell, and so are his over-the-top responses when Zane gets his lips on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no right time to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;Paul is afraid to start a relationship, and Zane can only handle so much more rejection. Will these two find their perfect moment, or will they realize you can't choose when and how you fall in love? If Paul can't take a risk, he may have to choose: the career he loves or the first man to capture his heart.</description>

  <description>Jordan O’Neill isn’t a fan of labels, considering he has a few. Gay, geek, a librarian, socially awkward, a nervous rambler, an introvert, an outsider. The last thing he needs is one more. But he when he realises adding the label ‘asexual’ might explain a lot, it turns his world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hennessy Lang moved to Surry Hills after splitting with his boyfriend. His being asexual had seen the end of a lot of his romances, but he’s determined to stay true to himself. Leaving his North Shore support group behind, he starts his own in Surry Hills, where he meets first-time-attendee Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bewildered and scared, but completely adorable, Hennessy is struck by this guy who’s trying to find where he belongs. Maybe Hennessy can convince Jordan that his world hasn’t been turned upside down at all, but maybe it’s now—for the first time in his life—the right way up.</description>

  <description>While war looms on the horizon, two powerful wolves fight a far more intimate war in this next installment of the New Dawn novels.&lt;br /&gt;Logan’s childhood taught him love comes with the potential of pain. Long ago, he decided he’d never have a mate, but one explosive encounter with Mia—a woman as lethal as she is beautiful—has him questioning everything. There’s a problem. Her heart’s as closed off as his and winning her isn’t going to be easy.&lt;br /&gt;River Run soldier Mia doesn’t allow men close, especially not those who hope to capture her heart. The last person she expects to find herself drawn to is a Dark Shadow wolf renowned for his playboy ways. Not only is he sexy, but he’s also charming—a dangerous combination. Getting close to Logan will end in heartbreak. But with Logan’s bold pursuit to win her difficult to ignore, there’s a clash coming.&lt;br /&gt;Logan and Mia find themselves playing the most passionate of games and when everything comes to a head, they must decide if loves worth the risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note this is a Novella</description>

  <description>Lorenzo Moretti and Damon Blackwell have never met, but they're tied together by the same tragedy. They were both there&lt;i&gt; that night&lt;/i&gt;. They each lost someone they loved. They've been living as shells of their former selves ever since. Running into each other and realizing their shared pasts? Pure serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being together is a tingle at the base of Enzo's spine, a comfort that settles into Damon's bones. No one understands what they went through the night the club caught fire--until now. For the first time, they have someone to lean on, someone who knows all the right things to say and when to say nothing at all. Neither of them has been with another man before, but their shared connection grows from friendship and explodes into something more, something raw and desperate and real. Now, they're dealing not only with their pasts, but their new relationship, the one thing that calms their internal storms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enzo and Damon might not know much else, but with every touch, with every word, and every night spent exploring each other's bodies, they know they're in love. They keep each other going, show each other what happiness really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But love alone can't get them through. Damon and Enzo must decide if they really have what it takes to work through their trauma and fight for the happily ever after that's waiting just on the horizon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When two small-town country dudes win the lottery, they finally find the courage to speak their truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected adventure follows.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linwood "Woody" Robinson has a routine. He works for his baby brother in construction, buys three lottery tickets every week, and lusts after his best friend from high school. He’s done the same thing for twenty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddison "Eddie" Howard owns the only gas station in their small South Carolina town, sells lottery tickets, and lusts after his best friend from afar.

But doing the boss is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gresh wants more from Lane than his ability to handle livestock, he wants it all. Lane won’t give him the time of day so he forces the issue, setting up a date that Lane believes to be a business meeting. Alone together, Lane and Gresh ignite in a flash of passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it feels like there could be something more between Lane and Gresh, the new doctor in town, Riley, sets his sights on Lane. Riley chases hard after him, insinuating himself in Lane’s life, highlighting Gresh’s faults. But Gresh won’t give up without a fight. Will Lane and Gresh be able to survive the intrusion, or will Riley be the one walking away with Lane's heart?</description>

  <description>Justin Molina has secrets. He’s served his time but remains a prisoner of his past, unable to forgive himself for failing his family when they needed him most. Justin’s grief is overwhelming, but he keeps silent and focuses on his goals. About to graduate college, he tries to keep his head above water—no matter how many times life keeps knocking him down. When he’s forced to register for a poetry-writing class, Justin discovers putting words to his feelings might be exactly what his fractured heart needs to heal. Or is it the older professor with the bow ties and gentle smile who gives him a chance when no one else will? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professor Foster Faraday Harding is a broken man. His divorce is final, and he’s reverted back to the safety of his books. Even his poetry no longer brings him joy; he’s sleepwalking through life. The raw emotion of Justin’s poetry awakens Foster to desires he thought long buried in the ashes of his marriage. When he discovers Justin is struggling financially, Foster offers him a solution that benefits both of them. Soon it’s Foster who’s struggling with emotions he can’t understand: Justin is his student. And a man. One crazy night years earlier doesn’t mean anything. Foster is straight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After months of denying the growing attraction between them, an unexpected kiss changes everything. Justin and Foster are no longer only professor and student—they’ve become lovers, but the strain of hiding their relationship increases with each passing day. Words have the power not only to hurt but to heal the greatest pain. If Foster and Justin listen to what their hearts are saying, they might break through their silence and live their own love poems—together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I'm walking away from that dream.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can't guarantee your life if you keep playing.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-three, an undiagnosed heart condition sends pro hockey player Cameron Riley back to his hometown newly single and looking for work. Cam can't hide his past – especially when his heart racing is a big risk, and boy, does his new boss's nephew make his heart race. Noah's exactly the kind of guy Cam needs after his hellish ex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I want to do something new.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art curator Noah Clark is glad his beekeeping uncle hired this hunk. Cameron is a sweet, smart bad boy. Noah works hard, like organizing a hockey-themed art exhibition, and he wants to let himself love hard. Noah's busy life would be perfect with Cameron, but what's his new lover hiding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Tell me why you've been watching me.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitting Cam's budding relationship with sweet Noah against millions of bucks, Cam is offered a lot of money to abandon his new priorities: life, love, and family. The game of their lives is on the line. And after all's said and done, is it too late for Noah to forgive Cam for his partial truths?</description>

  <description>She wants to save the Knights… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Miranda Callahan’s father, principle owner and hands-on dictator of the Georgia Knights, has a heart attack, the responsibility to make the team an independent success becomes solely hers. Though everyone expects her to fail in her new role, Miranda is determined to take her team to the top and earn her father's love and respect on the way. The only other obstacle is the League's consultant – a secret crush from her past – the man trying to take over the team, and the one person who can save them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants revenge… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LUCAS WAINRIGHT is a turnaround consultant, hired by the League to save the Knights and so many other teams – only this time it’s personal; before being ousted by Seamus Callahan, Lucas' family had been the owners of the team. Now, he has the perfect opportunity to regain his rightful position with the Knights, if he’s willing to suppress his scruples and his attraction to Miranda Callahan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Miranda and Lucas let go of old grudges and hold on to their new love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Knights of Passions series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Going all the Way &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Love from Left Field &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: The Game Changer</description>

  <description>I was born of nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a Void, a rare supernatural capable of absorbing powers at the brush of my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Feared. Hated. Untouchable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thibault Academy is full of supernaturals that want me dead, and the most powerful of them, the Paragons, will stop at nothing to ensure I go back to the hell I came from. They’re cruel, heartless, and have created an unlikely alliance to take me down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I want to learn how to control the nothingness, I’ll have to survive them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was born of the void, but I’ll die from the power. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a reverse harem bully romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; She was the light to my darkness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today Best Seller L. Wilder brings readers a new Satan's Fury series that is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Memphis, Tennessee, Satan's Fury MC had become the most notorious MC in the city. That recognition hadn't come easy. While people were visiting Graceland and walking down on Beale Street, my brothers and I were at war, fighting rival MCs and gangs who were trying to take control of our territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had staked our claim, but when a new threat arrived, everything we had worked for would be put in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenadee Brooks was a nurse, trying to save lives and make a difference in the world. The moment I saw her, it wasn't just her beauty that caught my eye. It was the light that burned deep inside of her that drew me in. I longed for it, and with each moment I spent with her, the more determined I became to make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she was pulled into my world, saw the life that I lived, would that light I craved still burn bright or would it disappear forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blaze is book one of the Satan's Fury MC- Memphis Chapter. This full-length standalone novel is intended for mature audiences only due to the explicit language and violence. Contains no cheating and a swoon-worthy HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Attending King University was at the top of my bucket list. Falling in love with my professor wasn’t.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Earning a full scholarship to King University was my hard earned ticket out of hell. I'm happy to be away from the small town I grew up in and all the equally small minded people who live there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King was going to be my safe haven. A place where I could leave the old me behind and finally grow into the young man my family had desperately tried to hide away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diving head first into new experiences, new friends, and parties, I didn’t expect to run straight into the one thing I wasn’t ready for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His arms are welcoming, his body is addictive and his lips are heaven. Cole Huxley is everything I could fall in love with, except for one problem... I never wanted to fall for my professor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Devilry is part of the King University Series, but can be read as a complete standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will he risk it all to be in safe arms? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a damaged man stumbles on a second chance, it’s all too easy to turn and run. It takes a determined photographer to convince him risk is worth it all.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;People deserve a second chance, right? How about a third or fourth? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what if I can’t even admit to myself who I am? I was truthful once before. I came out to one other person, and he left me broken and scarred. He destroyed the boy I was. I don’t even use the same name anymore; I go by Trent now. But I survived the streets. I got lucky and I made something of myself. I’m happy, sort of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s Angelo who lights up my life. He’s my world. My rock and my family. He’s always there for me. But I keep hurting him. I say stupid things, and I always keep him at a distance. Still, he knows me better than anyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I want him. But I can’t let myself go there. Not again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve lived in denial for so long and it’s killing me. In my weakest moments, I reach for Angelo and when he slips into my arms, I can breathe. He’s my solace. Selflessly, he’s there and he never expects anything in return. No judgment, not even an explanation. Having him in my arms is everything, and it’s getting harder to push him away. I’m not sure I want to anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t date, but he deserves to be loved. Cherished. Then he drops a bombshell—he’s found The One. I wish he’d fallen for me. I need that second chance to tell him. I need to risk it all because in his arms, I’m safe. I’m me. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can’t go home again&lt;/i&gt;—Nick’s motto for the past twenty years. He was a teenager when he and his mom left his mentally ill and abusive father back in a small town in the northwoods of Wisconsin. Nick’s made a life for himself as an artist in New York with a new show scheduled in nine months. He should be in a painting frenzy but so far he’s hanging empty canvas. Then comes the call—his estranged father has killed himself. Nick flies home to Lacland, a house crumbling from years of neglect and one very fat bulldog.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonas doesn’t love his job as a research lab veterinarian, although he enjoys volunteering on his boyfriend’s canine behavioral studies. But when he discovers his so called life partner is messing around, Jonas leaps at a job offer in a small town miles away.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the grief swirling around Nick and Jonas, their first meeting is electric. But Nick’s only in town for a short time and Jonas is still stinging from the betrayal. They try to keep their distance, but that’s easier said than done. Especially in a small town where misery and hope share the same address.</description>

  <description>Jake Tyler walked out of Covert Ops two years ago, a devastated, broken man after he discovered his sister brutally murdered by her husband, Riley. Since then he’s found a kind of peace running a rural bar. The last thing Jake Tyler expects is his former team to turn up with grim news. Jake’s ex-brother-in-law has escaped from prison and is heading Jake’s way. The team is here to protect Jake, whether he likes it or not – a decision reluctantly shared by their leader, Jake’s ex-lover Mitch Mitchelson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mitch is angry and hurting. The man he trusted – the man he adored more than anything – abandoned both his team and Mitch. Jake never gave Mitch a chance to help or come to terms with his desertion. Regardless of mission protocols, Mitch isn’t about to open his heart again to that kind of pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the strong attraction between them can’t be denied. How are they ever going to work together when Mitch still resents Jake’s disappearance, and to Jake, the team represents everything that destroyed him in the first place? And meantime they wait for Riley to find them... and to settle the threat once and for all.</description>

  <description>Whoever thought achieving career goals could be boring? Not Duncan Witten, but here he is at forty-one, in his dream job… and hating it. Throw it all away for a challenge? Yes, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only Dunc had known his challenging new job came with Paul Hanks, a man who redefines “stubborn.” They need to work together to meet targets, but thanks to Dunc’s idiot predecessor, Paul won’t take his calls or reply to emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one solution: travel across the country and confront Paul face-to-face. It’s time to take things out of the office.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Their mating will redefine the future...if they don't kill each other first&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;When immortal warrior Aaron's twin is killed, he's on the verge of destroying himself, only to be saved by the sight of a feisty dragon-shifter who is his fated mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope's dragon recognizes Aaron as her mate. Yet, she must deny him; for dragon shifters can only mate with their own kind. If she were to accept the mating bond with Aaron, she risks killing him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together in a fight to save their two races from the deadly Elysian, a powerful warrior race stronger than any shifter or immortal, Aaron and Hope must defeat this new threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can they also find the way to each other's soul? &lt;p&gt;This is Hope and Aaron's story, book 1 in the Dragon Protectors Series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Escape with Leo and Zak in outback Australia as they discover it sometimes takes time, distance, and interfering family to amalgamate.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After five years of living in the UK, it’s time for Leo to return home to his dad’s stud farm in outback Australia. He has no idea what to expect when he arrives. He didn’t exactly leave with balloons and banners. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope. His farewell involved destruction and his own heart split in two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows seeing the man who’s always held his heart, Zak, is going to be awkward. The older farm manager made his feelings pretty damn clear when Leo hightailed it out of there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leo quickly figures out life is going to get complicated and a whole heap more exciting as his trip home becomes so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amalgamated is a fun and steamy M/M short story in Becca Seymour’s Coming Home series. Stand-alone romances complete with heat, wit, and happily ever afters.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A M/M Small-town Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They say everything's bigger in Texas. &lt;br /&gt;But these Irish brothers beg to differ.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My brother Keenan and I haven't seen Aunt Molly in years. My father’s beloved, but eccentric younger sister had moved from Ireland to Texas, of all places. But now, we’re saddened and surprised to learn that Molly has passed away and left the two of us her Texas ranch. Animals and all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have no idea what to do to maintain a ranch. But the truth is, Keenan and I are bored. We’ve worked our ways up in the world and make tons of money in our shared business, and the idea of doing something so wildly different sounds like it could be fun. After all, what do we have to lose? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, the answer turns out to be our hearts. When our stunningly beautiful and curvy new neighbor, Delia, drops in with a homemade pie, we’re both swooning. And when she rescues us from an incident involving a chicken and a Pez dispenser, both of us are tripping over ourselves to win hers in return. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this feisty brunette filly seems to have no interest in being corralled by one of us. In fact, she seems to want both of us to take a ride… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 30,000 word MFM menage romance is a standalone with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a happy ever after. Both guys are all about pleasing one lucky lady this St. Patrick's Day - there's no m/m.</description>

  <description>Mason Thompson hates motorbike racing. It’s stupid, pointless, and dangerous. The glorified man-children who partake in this idiocy are even worse. None more so than Liam Ryan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam Ryan is cocky, and he has every reason to be. There’s not a person on the track—or off it—who can get the better of him. He’ll be damned if drop-dead gorgeous paramedic Mason Thompson is the first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when events and overzealous bloggers seek to force them even further apart, will they risk everything to be together?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will they break ground and realise sometimes the greatest risk results in the ultimate reward?</description>

  <description>A Joy Universe Novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Bryer loves his life. His job as an assistant director at Joy Universe, the second-largest theme park complex on the planet, makes him indirectly responsible for bringing joy (pun intended) to millions of people. So what if none of his relationships are that close? Everyone he meets loves him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Trav Jones. For some reason, the visiting Broadway performer would rather Derek just go away. He appreciates Derek’s work ethic, though, and after Trav steps up when Derek desperately needs someone to fill in for his sick staff, Derek seizes the chance to convince Trav he’s not such a bad guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love while distracted by a murder at the park, food poisoning, and colleagues placing bets on their relationship won’t be easy, but between the two of them and with the magic of Joy Universe, they’ve got this.</description>

  <description>Finn thinks he's not worthy of love. Luke thinks he's destined to be a lone wolf. But once they find each other, their lives will never be the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the institution after a failed suicide attempt, Finn's ready to crawl back up and reclaim life. He'll stick to his plan, take the tests, kiss all the butts and get back into grad school. That’s all he thinks about until he meets his new roommate the older, intimidating Luke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kicked out of his pack for being gay, alpha wolf Luke sees no way out of the solitary life he leads. That is, until he sees Finn, bent over the kitchen island, and the need to claim him, take him, becomes too much to bear. He'll do whatever it takes to bring Finn out of his shell and convince him they're mates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Luke’s alpha essence begins to change Finn in ways he never could have imagined. While the possibility of starting a family fills him with pride, the fear of the unknown, of what it could do to Finn, fills him with dread. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing Luke knows for sure--there is no going back, not after finding Finn.</description>

  <description>Allie Rydell left her life behind to protect the world from the Goddess of Night. But after weeks of training, hunting, and learning to use the life-giving power that inexplicably chose her, saving Midgard seems more impossible than ever. Nott’s followers have eyes across the realms, and they’re determined to collect the bounty on Allie’s soul. And the closer Allie and her protectors get to the pieces of the immortal weapon that could save them all, the more destruction Nott manages to unleash — not only on the world Allie loves, but on the friends she’d give her life to save. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkness is coming. And this time, it won’t leave any survivors.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a single dad and a newly outed veterinarian meet by chance, it takes red-cheeked conversations, a tentative friendship, and the willingness to put their hearts on the line to show these men they’re made for each other.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single dad Davis Jackson is busy balancing his coffee shop and being the best dad he can be. That doesn’t mean he’s not lonely. After a fumbling encounter with a man who looks as gorgeous as he does unhappy, Davis is left wondering who the mystery man is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Davis knows is that he has never felt such an instant attraction to anyone before, but when he discovers the brown-eyed man’s identity, it’s clear the recently out-of-the-closet veterinarian is lost and quite possibly broken.</description>

  <description>Love. Honor. Protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Environmental Studies major, Allie knows the planet is in trouble – a series of natural disasters recently rocked the northern hemisphere, and species across the globe are going extinct. What Allie doesn’t know is that her world's decline is a casualty of an ancient battle called the Night War – the Norse goddess Nott’s crusade to control the weakest of the light realms. And Allie most definitely doesn’t know that her existence is the only thing stopping Nott from dragging the earth into total darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When four gorgeous guys show up claiming to be Allie’s Asgardian protectors, she thinks they’re delusional. And when they order her to hunt down the pieces of an immortal weapon, she’s convinced they’re insane. But when Allie’s attacked, the guys’ crazy stories of demigods and dark elves begin coming together. And Allie’s not sure what scares her more – losing her life to the Goddess of Night... or losing her heart to one of her protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the hunt begin.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes the best things come from the most unexpected circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian Ryan knows love when he sees it. Having watched his uncles and father fall in love right in front of his eyes, he’s confident Nia Matthews is his forever girl. Absolutely nothing will stand in his way of making Nia his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nia Matthews has loved Christian Ryan her whole life. He’s her best friend, her lover, her everything. But she yearns for more. She yearns for a life outside of Booker, a life of her own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to light just how apart the two are, the distance seems insurmountable. &lt;br /&gt;Will they break up, break out, or realise that sometimes the best things come from the most unexpected circumstances? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My oldest enemy is back from the dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My father. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Backed by an army of witches and mercenaries, he’s determined to steal my magic and make me his slave again—and to subject my sister to the same fate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To save us, I’ll need both my packs. The Northern wolves I loved first, the ones who saved me. The dangerous but alluring men of the Atlantic pack who have won my heart since. Their alphas are childhood friends turned sworn enemies. But I have no time for men’s drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They called me the shifter princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’ll learn I’m the queen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coven's Revenge&lt;/b&gt; is the explosive final chapter in the Their Shifter Princess trilogy. Escape today into a world of reverse harem romance, adventure, and fate. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love could cost me everything. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s love that keeps me coming home, to the beautiful house full of ugly secrets. As soon as I’m eighteen, as soon as I can take custody of my little sister myself, I’m going to run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Survivors don’t fall in love.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But my world is turned upside down by four mysterious men. The heat between us is intense. Their protectiveness feels real. Overnight, they become gods in our town. They can’t seem to stay away from me. I can’t resist them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lovers don’t survive. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can't risk my chance to save my sister, though. Not even to save my heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there any hope I can take care of her…and still lose myself in the arms of these men? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THEIR SHIFTER PRINCESS is the first book in an exciting new reverse harem romance series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the girl next door returns home as a millionaire to face the farmer who never lost hope, she's caught between the man of her past and the man meant for her future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adopted as an infant, Ireland Leighton grew up in the heart of the Midwest. After inheriting millions from her biological parents, she is determined to help others any way she can. The only string is a business engagement with another millionaire. Ireland returns to Iowa years later to plan her brother’s tropical wedding. The festivities would be easier if her sexy ex-boyfriend stayed out of reach and her future wasn’t already planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time suppressed his feelings for the girl next door, but Gideon Taggart isn’t about to let Ireland escape again. Farmer by day, veterinarian by choice, his second chance with his first love is far from easy. He soon discovers that no matter how much he loves Ireland, she’ll always choose her family over a future with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oceans Away is book two in Skye McNeil’s stand-alone contemporary romance series, Atlas. Each book contains a millionaire to envy, snort-worthy comedy, and visits to many beautiful cities in the world. Yes, all of that, plus each novel ends with a fabulous HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the beginning, there was one determined man and one strong woman. In their struggles, they created a dynasty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brick had one mission since he was a boy: become a Dragon Runner. The motorcycle club meant everything to him. Blood and bone from his brothers paid the Dragon’s dues time and time again. And watching it split apart was more than he could handle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he met Betsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unwanted daughter born into abuse, Betsy lived her life beatdown under a rigid thumb, never allowed to be herself. Her one goal was to leave her abusive family and be free. She fought on the losing end of that fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she met Brick.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"I never thought I'd want to get screwed by a mechanic ..."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The latest assignment for Miami 8 News intern Liam sounds easy enough: catch the crooked crew at Scud's Auto on camera. Liam &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; feels guilty setting up hunky mechanic Paul Parisi -- but then he's always been a sucker for a tall, muscular stud in an oil-stained jumpsuit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's only one problem: &lt;i&gt;straight guy&lt;/i&gt; Paul seems more interested in screwing Liam some &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; way. With a promotion on the line, can Liam resist Paul's curious flirting and obtain the footage he needs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Thanks to my past, I'm stuck here."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a guy who stands behind quality service, cutting corners is causing all sorts of stressors in Paul's life -- including an embarrassing &lt;i&gt;failure to ignite&lt;/i&gt; with women. But when Paul takes a private test drive with a handsome customer, his engine doesn't just fire right up ... he throws a rod. &lt;i&gt;And he's pretty sure Liam saw it, too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If anyone at the shop found out what they were up to, Paul knows he'd be out of a job. But Liam won't take his car elsewhere -- it's almost like the guy &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; to get ripped off. &lt;i&gt;What's his deal, anyway?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screwed&lt;/b&gt; is a 45,000 word &lt;b&gt;first time gay romance&lt;/b&gt;! A light-hearted novel featuring a jacked and bi-curious mechanic, a terrible disguise, two men playing doctor, sex on Miami beach, and more! No cliffhanger, no cheating, but the HEA is guaranteed.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who's that handsome stud behind the wheel?&lt;br /&gt;Fancy seeing such a sight in this small town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just another service call until I see that the broken-down car on the side of the road is a luxury BMW, which is out of place here in Baytown. And then I about faint when I see that the delicious-looking man inside it is Ashton Falls, my old high school classmate, and the object of my obsession ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Back then, I wanted him bad, but never let on. I was the popular football jock, and he was the nerd who tutored me. I had a reputation to uphold, which included staying closeted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After graduation, Ashtown moved away and became a Silicon Valley tech billionaire. He's back in Baytown for our ten-year high school reunion. Meanwhile, I stayed here to take care of my mom, and opened a mechanic's shop. And I'm still in that damn closet, because there's a stigma around these parts against gay men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our worlds are about as night and day as they could get. But soon they collide with a night of passion in which I discover that Ashton is as attracted to me as I was to him, and that he always has been. &lt;br /&gt;He can teach me more than just math now, and he's as athletic in the bedroom as I was on the field. I want him to stay with me, and &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; me, for good. But will both of us be willing and able to change our lives enough for that to happen? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And, first things first, after hiding my true identity from fellow Baytown residents for my entire life, will I have the courage to show up at our high school reunion with Ashton on my arm?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because You Came Back&lt;/i&gt; is a full-length standalone coming out, small town, second chance, rags to riches, opposites attract, billionaire/blue collar gay romance novel that combines humor, heat and heart. It has no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a very happy after ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Book 1 in the &lt;i&gt;Baytown Boys&lt;/i&gt; series. It can be read alone but, due to related characters and settings, is best read with others in the series... and a tall glass of water to cool you off after so much steam.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Secrets from his past have scarred his heart. Can he trust her enough to learn to love again?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the eyes of the law, I’d atoned for the secrets of my past, but in my heart, I knew the debt I owed was too big to ever be repaid. I didn’t ask for forgiveness, because I knew I wasn’t worthy of it. Guilt weighed me down and scarred my heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it wasn’t for my art, I’d probably be dead. The truth was, I had nothing else to live for. Or so I thought until Octavia Douglas came breezing unexpectedly into the picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy, stubborn, and smart enough to know better than to throw her future away on a guy like me, Vivi made me question everything I thought I already knew. I suddenly craved the happy ever after I’d never dared dream of, and knew I didn’t deserve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He vowed to protect the broken shards of his heart, until she etched herself on his soul.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cold. Hard. Heartless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don’t rise, I can’t fall. If I don’t give, I can’t take. If I don’t love, I can’t lose. If I don’t break, I can’t heal. If I don’t care, I can’t hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I don’t expose my heart, it can’t get broken.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a boy, Arlo Jones learned that hearts could literally be broken. His shattered into a thousand tiny pieces when his dad died, and he vowed to never let that happen again. He had to be cold, hard, and heartless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man, he has his shtick with chicks. He's never been in love, or even in lust. He gets horny, fucks, and sends them on their way. Rinse. Repeat. It's not broken, so there's no need to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until London. Meeting her is the start of something big, like the first bump of coke or hit of the pipe. From day one, the only way forward is deeper in, and there is no easy way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is love, he's never going to be the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Willa Knight: Dead? Alive? Damned to a state of eternal bad luck?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willa and the Abcurse brothers are back, and more determined than ever to stick by each other. Unfortunately, Staviti has other plans, plans that threaten to change the natural order of the worlds—though nobody really understands why. His agenda may very well affect all beings on Minatsol, even those that thought themselves safe in Topia. Even &lt;i&gt;Willa-invincible-Knight&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;Unsure with her new place in the worlds, Willa must follow the Abcurses to their new post: Champions Peak, a secluded mountain far from civilization, where the most powerful sols have been summoned to hone their abilities through direct contact with the gods. &lt;br /&gt;There is a chance that she might survive her time on the mountain, but it seems like staying alive amidst the powerful occupants of the Peak is the least of her concerns. &lt;br /&gt;Her real problem is staying on the mountain at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 4 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A male prostitute, a mangy cat, a murder and an obsession that threatens his career, his impending marriage and his life. Nothing is going as planned for Austin Glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Glass seems to have it all, A loving fiancee, a future with the FBI and a healthy sized trust fund. At least on the surface. He also has a grin and a wisecrack for every situation. But the smile he presents to the world hides a painful past he’s buried too deeply to remember, and his quips mask bitterness and insecurity. Austin has himself and most of the whole world fooled—until he meets a redhead in a pair of bunny slippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As events unfold in the biggest case of his life, Austin’s carefully planned future unravels, and he finds himself pushed into making quick, life-changing decisions. But can he trust himself or anything he feels, when each event seems to be just a series of volatile reactions?</description>

  <description>Alpha Hunter Maison’s primary focus is to keep his wolf pack healthy and happy. But with humans encroaching, they need a way to shift without getting noticed. He knows the local feline pride has found a way to temper their inner animal and asks for their help. Finding a desire to submit to the gorgeous lion shifter is unsettling. Knowing he is his mate turns his world upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blaise Wylde has worked tirelessly for his pride his entire life. As owner and creator of Wylde KingDom, a BDSM club just for feline shifters, he knows the power that BDSM can wield for their inner animal. When Hunter asks him to help the Pack learn BDSM, he agrees, especially when his inner lion is instantly interested and Hunter turns out to be submissive to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone in the Pack is unhappy about their alpha being involved with ‘a cat’ and anger quickly escalates to attacks. As Blaise fights to protect his mate, Hunter must do the same, because while he’s trying to find his attacker, someone’s after Blaise and he may already be too late to stop him.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;This is a story about losing the path and finding yourself. It contains kissing, yelling, spanking, and carb-loaded family interventions.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hockey superstar Joey Luciano has always been good at being whatever people needed him to be. The fans want a good-looking fast-living party boy? Enter ‘the Looch,’ Joey’s carefully created public persona. But the cracks in his mask are starting to show, and he’s begun to lose touch with who he really is. It’s going to take someone who’s been there from the very beginning, to help him find his way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Liam O’Reilly always had a very clear picture of what his life should look like. Falling in love with the infuriating, passionate, stubborn, and endlessly fascinating boy next door was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of the plan. But when Liam’s carefully constructed life fell apart one Christmas Eve, Joey Luciano was there to pick up the pieces. Now Liam can't stop wanting him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The passion blazing between them on the ice and behind closed doors could leave both of them badly burned. But through the smoke, Liam can see glimpses of a future brighter than any he’d imagined, a future worth risking his career and reputation for, if only he is brave enough to reach for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Joey’s got a secret he’s keeping from everyone. If it gets out, it could be the end of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Despite multiple degrees and business success, in his heart Jeremy Strauss feels he’s never measured up. While he hasn’t lacked for men or women to share his bed, Jeremy has yet to find someone who sees beyond his muscles and perfect smile. Taking it slow with a lover isn’t how he operates, but something about the shy accountant he rescues in a snowstorm makes him want this time to be different. So what if Blake drops little comments here and there about Jeremy’s pretty face? Their relationship is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lonely most of his life, Blake Myers is as careful with his heart as he is with a balance sheet. The last thing he expects is for a man like Jeremy to fall for him, and he can't help but wait for the bubble to burst on their relationship. When the stress of a professional crisis turns personal, Blake sees the perfect relationship he and Jeremy have built start to crumble. Caught in an ever-tightening web of lies, rather than wait for Jeremy to leave him, Blake breaks it off and vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection is an illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy doesn’t know which way to turn and for the first time in his life, he’s lost and uncertain. Believing he’s no longer the man Jeremy needs, Blake sinks deeper into despair. Both men struggle with secrets, lies, and hurtful memories until they are forced to look inside their hearts and learn the truth—that love is perfectly imperfect.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Eve lived a very boring, very vanilla life with her boyfriend and two year old daughter. After the douchebag left her, leaving her a penniless single mum, her best friends wedding in Australia came at just the right time. She's missed her childhood friend, Teresa moved to the Aussie sun with her widowed father when the girls were 18, meeting her biker lover out there and now Eve is set to be her Maid of Honor. Instead of having the much needed break she's looking for, she witnesses a crime that puts her life in danger. Her dream vacation just turned into a nightmare, something she has only read about in the books she loves to escape in. Being rescued by Severed MC turns out to be an experience. The clubs VP Gabe aka Angel, could be just the diversion she needs right now but, no matter how hot the tattooed biker is in and out of bed, she still misses her daughter back in England. Book One in a two part story. *** CONTAINS ADULT THEMES AND MATERIAL - OVER 18's ONLY ***</description>

  <description>Cynthia “Cyn” Robinson has only ever wanted three things: the approval of her stepmother, to save lives as a firefighter, and the attention of her dream girl, Marigold Grimm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A socialite who most of the town refers to as Grimm Falls royalty, Marigold is so far out of Cyn’s league that even dreaming about her could be considered inappropriate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Cyn has all but given up on her stepmother, who refuses to accept a daughter who does not delight in wearing dresses and working in her clothing boutique. Cyn tried to be that girl ever since she and her father moved to Grimm Falls, but sooner or later, she always turns back into a pumpkin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing Cyn does have is her job. She’s a great firefighter, and when an arsonist strikes her beloved town, she’s ready to forget the unfulfilled parts of her life and throw herself into work – until Marigold Grimm’s beloved garden becomes the firebug’s next target. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cyn puts out the blaze, but there’s more than one type of spark flying as Cyn and Marigold meet. Is her dream girl really within reach, or will it all go up in flames? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinders is a contemporary fairy tale based on the original Grimm Brothers’ Cinderella.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Laid off and down to her last few dollars, Gina Taylor is desperate to provide for her baby boy when she sees an advertisement for a mail order bride in Marietta, Montana. On just a photo of a serious but handsome man and the charm of his kind, deep voice on the phone, Gina packs up her few belongings and leaves the hardships of San Francisco behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When widowed deputy sheriff Rory Watson buys a neglected ranch in desperate need of repairs and a homey touch, he realizes how much he misses the companionship marriage offers. His brother found a bride and happiness with an advertisement. Maybe he can too. But Rory gets more than he bargained for when Gina arrives, baby on her hip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rory can forgive a lot, but Gina never mentioned a baby. His instinct is to send her home, but his uneasy conscience insists she stay – temporarily. Gradually, Rory discovers that Gina’s smile, love of country life, and can-do attitude wake up something he never knew was dormant, and the chubby baby reminds him of how much he once wanted a family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can a down-on-her-luck woman find the home she’s always wanted with a man afraid to love again?</description>

  <description>The hardest thing a rebel can do isn’t standing up for something—it’s standing up for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life takes delight in stabbing Gus Scott in the back when he least expects it. After Gus spends years running from his past, present, and the dismal future every social worker predicted for him, karma delivers the one thing Gus could never—would never—turn his back on: a son from a one-night stand he’d had after a devastating breakup a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to San Francisco and to 415 Ink, his family’s tattoo shop, gave him the perfect shelter to battle his personal demons and get himself together… until the firefighter who’d broken him walked back into Gus’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Rey Montenegro, tattoo artist Gus Scott was an elusive brass ring, a glittering prize he hadn’t the strength or flexibility to hold on to. Severing his relationship with the mercurial tattoo artist hurt, but Gus hadn’t wanted the kind of domestic life Rey craved, leaving Rey with an aching chasm in his soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gus’s life and world starts to unravel, Rey helps him pick up the pieces, and Gus wonders if that forever Rey wants is more than just a dream.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A gay friends to lovers romance. &lt;br /&gt;I’m Aaron. I’ve got a crush the size of Europe on Joe, who lives across the street, and when he’s around, I transform into a prize idiot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rest of the time I’m a trainee plumber. On Sundays, I play in the amateur football league. In all, a confident, well-adjusted guy. For a 20-year-old virgin who lives with his parents and falls apart over the boy not-quite next door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joe’s cute, sexy, fun and the reason the word sexy was invented. We used to play together as kids in the massive posh house that he lives in with his parents, the doctors. Now he’s at university, studying literature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do I ask a guy for a date when I can’t string together a coherent sentence when he’s around, and I don’t even know if he’s gay? And what’s more, no one knows I’m gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who keeps their boyfriend in the closet these days? &lt;br /&gt;I want the world to know how much he means to me. &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to come out, but not today, I can do it next week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a hot, sexy, feel-good romance about two young men who fall in love for the first time. They are crazy about each other and do lots of kissing, hand holding, and taking their clothes off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***A feel-good coming out story.*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;64,000 words of standalone sexy, comedy, romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two novellas previously published separately in 2016, now combined into one full length novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A two-hundred-year-old curse. A tangled thread of mental illness. A growing list of Ross family women dying young. The house where it all began, Desolate Ridge, holds all the secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned at a hospital when she was only three years old, Aubrey Ross grew up as a ward of the state, passed from one foster family to the next. Having endured years of abuse and neglect, she’s become hardened to the world around her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s flirted with depression and anxiety, and she’s haunted by premonitions. When a strange man approaches Aubrey with information about her past, she knows her life is about to change. Inside the envelope is the deed to a house in Ohio—her ancestral home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Aubrey arrives in Rossdale, the town named after her family, she immediately experiences situations she cannot explain. She hears voices, sees apparitions, and has vivid visions of tragedies she can scarcely comprehend. Aubrey comes to realize she is reliving events which have happened to those who came before her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Hank Metzger, the town’s sheriff, whose family has an eerie connection to her own. As the secrets of Desolate Ridge are unearthed, Aubrey begins to understand her destiny is tied to Hank’s in a way she cannot escape.</description>

  <description>Brielle Atwater isn't sure of much, but she knows a few things: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Having black wings is not normal. &lt;br /&gt;2. Selling her soul to the demons was a mistake. &lt;br /&gt;3. Lincoln Grey is the biggest *** she's ever met … but not falling in love with him might prove impossible. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When angels fell from the sky to war with the demons that ravaged Earth, their combined powers infected humanity. Now, the humans are assigned one of two fates, being either demon gifted or angel blessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wings sprout from Brielle's back at her awakening ceremony, she's sure she's an angel blessed celestial. It's not until she sees black wings that she realizes something is terribly wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sold her contract at a young age to save her father's life means she should be bound for Tainted Academy. That is, until a fallen angel unexpectedly fights for her to be accepted into Fallen Academy, the elite school for those that inhabit Angel City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's immediately matched with her impossibly handsome celestial teacher, Lincoln Grey. Laying eyes on him, her first thought is that her time at the academy might actually be fun, but this theory quickly fades when she and Lincoln clash on day one. To further prove her admission into Fallen Academy is cursed, the entire school is thrown into chaos when an Abrus demon reveals that he knows Brielle's secret. Now, above all else, Lincoln must fight to protect her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To his surprise, the only thing more difficult than trying to save her … is trying not to fall for her.</description>

      <![CDATA[A fun plot with likable characters, Buckle Up was an enjoyable read. With several sweet and sexy moments, it was easy to get caught up in the characters' developing relationship. The writing was okay, a little flowery and wordy at times but nothing too distracting.<br />]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A forty-something single dad, a twenty-something hockey star, and a whole lot of baggage. No, this couldn’t possibly blow up in their faces.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Officer Geoff Logan has his plate full. His cop’s salary and Marine retirement aren’t enough to make ends meet. He’s got war wounds and demons that are in it for the long haul. His teenagers are, well, teenagers, plus they’re pissed that he left the boyfriend they loved. Can’t a guy catch a break? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seattle Steelheads center Asher Crowe has it all. A seven figure salary. A literal house on a hill. A stable, loving relationship with an amazing boyfriend. At least, that’s what the world sees. Behind closed doors, he’s been living in a private hell, and when he finally works up the courage to end things, his boyfriend refuses to go quietly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One call to the cops, and suddenly Geoff and Asher’s paths cross. But is the connection between them simple chemistry? Kindred spirits? Or just a pair of lonely hearts looking for a hot distraction? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And even if it’s more than physical, is there really a future for two men from such vastly different worlds? Especially when the past comes knocking? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novel is approximately 89,000 words long. &lt;br /&gt;TW: abuse, combat PTSD</description>

  <description>BUD/S: six months of the most intense training there is. It’s survival of the toughest, and Matt Knytych is determined to come out the other side a navy SEAL. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraction is life or death. And just the sight of former marine Shane Hovland is enough to shake Matt’s concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane came to BUD/S training ready to prove himself—again. Semper Fi is forever, but he needs a new start. Not this dangerous heat with a man he barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything they’ve ever wanted is riding on a thin, punishing line. And they’ll have to fight for more than just each other if they want to make it through intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, the only easy day was yesterday.</description>

  <description>Death comes in Armani. Salvation comes in leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Principessa to the Mancuso crime family, Alexandra knows a thing or two about living outside the bounds of the law. Suffocated by the future her father has laid out for her, she makes a choice she can't take back, changing the entire trajectory of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust into the dark and dangerous world of the Forsaken Motorcycle Club for her own protection, Alex finds herself faced with the last thing she needs right now: the man of her dreams. He’s sex in leather, the devil incarnate, and one hell of a kisser. But he’s also off-limits. Ryan Stone can be her friend, but he’s forbidden to be her lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third-generation Forsaken, Ryan knows nothing other than life on two wheels, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. He enjoys the many privileges that come with the patch, and the only laws he recognizes are the ones set-forth by his club. That is, until who he wants more than anything isn’t allowed on the back of his bike —or in his bed. Balancing his desire for her body, and need to keep her safe, Ryan tries to keep Alex at a distance. Finally having made a choice for herself, she’s done hearing the word “no” and will push boundaries even Ryan himself doesn’t dare cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is never more tempting than when it’s forbidden.</description>

  <description>Coming home doesn’t always solve things … but it does pave the way for second chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take one deadly bite and, bam, a man’s life is changed forever, or so Caleb discovers when a loss of control leads to him joining the military and leaving everything behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time goes by … years spent silent and alone, cut off from those he loves. Until it’s time to come back, a scarred veteran, in many ways broken and looking for a meaning to his life. Perhaps it's not too late to right some wrongs. Make amends. Kiss a certain pair of sweet lips one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only Renny would damned well let him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t take Caleb long to realize Renny’s just the thing this croc needs to bring him back to life. Yet, what if he loses control again? He doesn’t want to take nibbling on her thighs to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, he can’t stay away, especially not when he discovers her secret. Add in a strange creature stalking the townsfolk and there is no way he’s leaving her alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago it just about killed him to leave, but Caleb’s a changed man now. A darker kind of animal, and this retired soldier is ready to kill so he can stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Bitten Point, where the swamp doesn't just keep its secrets, it sometimes eats them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When evil stirs in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, heroes come in both ordinary and extraordinary packages.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignatius Faber knows a few things for absolute certain. He’s half-demon, his father is the unequivocal prince of darkness, and demons want to destroy his city. And if he doesn’t make the first move on his crush, they’re never going to be anything more than a teenage fantasy that’s lasted into his thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lalo Pavia grew up hard and fast, orphaned at a young age. As an autistic, he’s learned to approach life cautiously. He throws his energy into gardening and photography—allowing both to provide a buffer between himself and the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Except for Iggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they find triumph, life, and even love in the middle of a city in flames?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Their fight for the mile high city has just begun.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A lost virgin vampire queen. Two vampire knights sworn to protect her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s about to get very hot… and bloody… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since her mother was murdered by monsters five years ago, Shara Isador has been on the run. Alone, scared, and exhausted, she’s finally cornered in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Out of hope with nowhere else to turn, she’s ready to end it all when two men come to her rescue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say she’s a lost queen descended from Isis, and they’re her Blood, vampire knights sworn to protect her. It all seems like a crazy nightmare, until the alpha offers his blood. Then she realizes she’s never wanted anything more. Except maybe his body… and his friend’s, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they’re not the only ones searching for a lost queen. Shara must learn how to wield her new powers quickly and conquer her fears if she intends to keep them all alive.</description>

  <description>Jason Davis can handle a breakup. And an overwhelming mortgage. And a struggling business. And the excruciating pain that keeps him up at night thanks to a shoulder injury. But all of it at once? Not so much. When his shoulder finally pushes him to a breaking point, Jason takes a friend’s advice and gives acupuncture a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acupuncturist Michael Whitman is a single dad struggling to make ends meet. When a mutual friend refers Jason as a patient, and Jason suggests a roommate arrangement to alleviate their respective financial strains, Michael jumps at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jason soon finds himself regretting it—he’s too damn attracted to Michael, and living with him is harder than he thought it’d be. In fact, the temptation to act on his feelings would almost be too much if not for the fact that Michael is straight. Or at least, that’s what their mutual friend claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Note: This is a revised second edition, with minor additions, of the first edition originally published elsewhere.)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Gripping</strong><br /><br />This book offered great escapism. I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters. I have a soft spot for characters who have courage to come out when they’re older. This book is a great example. A sweet and sexy read. ]]>

  &lt;i&gt;What happens when a star-gazing professor falls for his hot young housekeeper? One heck of an earthy explosion…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Marek Janos's genius at analyzing stellar explosions doesn't apply to his own disordered world. Forgetting to eat, sleep, and leave his lab has triggered some epic personal disasters. When his family insists he hire live-in help, he discovers home life has awesome benefits. His new housekeeper's smile sparks more energy than a supernova. And the way he moves? It rocks Marek's galaxy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete Schulz took a tough fall from his high-flying life in Hollywood. But how does a guy whose best skill is getting dirty clean up his act? His new gig with Domesticated Inc seems like a great first step. Keeping house for a nerdy young astrophysics professor is exactly the low-key, no-chance-for-trouble job he needs, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living together is surprisingly easy for both men. And fun. And more than a little hot. It's when they're faced with the idea of living apart that the truly messy work begins…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 90,000 word stand-alone novel with two quirky heroes--one who actually likes to vacuum, and one who enjoys studying Weakly Compressible Homogeneous Isoptropic Turbulences.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The alliance holds strong after the last attack, but bad blood threatens to jeopardize the treaty and test the bonds formed between the River Run and Dark Shadow packs.&lt;br /&gt;Tyler never meant for one night of fun to turn into a secret relationship, yet he can’t… won’t give Regan up, even if it means lying to his alpha or leaving the pack that is his home. His family.&lt;br /&gt;Regan felt the spark between her and Tyler from the start. He woke her from a half-life, pulling her from the darkness of her past, which threatens to extinguish the love between them before it has a chance to begin.&lt;br /&gt;Lines are being blurred, allegiances tested, and as hearts break and tears fall, will Tyler and Regan’s love bring them all together, or be a step too far and destroy the packs for good?</description>

  <description>NYPD Detective Alec MacAidan has always been good with weird. After all, his life has been a string of the unexplainable. But when an injured man gives him cryptic clues, then turns to dust in front of him, Alec's view on weird is changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cronin, a vampire Elder, has spent the last thousand years waiting for Alec. He'd been told his fated one would be a man wielding a shield, but he didn't expect him to be human, and he certainly didn't expect that shield to be a police badge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men, strong-willed and stubborn, are still learning how to cope with the push and pull of being fated, when fate throws them another curveball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors have spread quickly of turmoil in Egypt. Covens are fleeing with news of a vampire who has a talent like no other, hell-bent on unleashing the wrath of Death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alec and Cronin are thrown into a world of weird Alec cannot imagine. What he learned in school of ancient pharaohs and Egyptian gods was far from the truth. Instead, he finds out firsthand that history isn't always what it seems.</description>

  <description>Sometimes family chooses you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At forty, Vincent “Vinnie” Fierro is still afraid to admit he might be gay—even to himself. It’ll be a problem for his big, fat Italian family. Still, after three failed marriages, it’s getting harder to ignore what he really wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vinnie attempts some self-exploration in Chicago’s Boystown bars, far from anyone who knows him. Naturally, he runs smack into someone from the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between working two jobs, going to school, taking care of his grandmother, and dealing with his mother’s ongoing substance abuse, Trey Giles has little time for fun, let alone dating someone who swears he’s straight. Yet after one night of dancing cheek-to-cheek, Trey agrees to let Vinnie court him and see if he truly belongs on this side of the fence—though Trey intends to keep his virginity intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a solid plan, but nothing is simple when family is involved. When Vinnie’s family finds out about their relationship, the situation is sticky enough, but when Trey’s mother goes critical, Vinnie and Trey must decide whose happiness is most important—their families’ or their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second Edition.&lt;br /&gt;First Edition published by Samhain, 2013.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sequel to How to Be a Normal Person&lt;br /&gt;A How to Be Novel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah Erickson wants to be a movie star. The problem with that is so does half of Los Angeles. But he’s on his way, what with memorable roles as a TV show background cadaver and a guy in a commercial for herpes medication. All he needs is his big break. And that break may come in the form of a novelist who goes by the enigmatic name of Q-Bert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q-Bert, who is ready to make his directorial debut in a film Josy would be perfect for. Q-Bert, who Josy may or may not have a friend-crush on, and potentially something more. Being demisexual can be confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the City of Angels to the small mountain town of Abby, Oregon, Josy will give his all to make sure his dreams come true—even the ones he never thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sticks and stones do break bones, and words will surely hurt you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staring down the barrel of a loaded 9mm is a wake-up call, especially when it’s your husband’s finger on the trigger. Brooklyn James’s only thought is to take her baby and run. It's better to end up on the streets than suffer one more day beneath her husband's hand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally back on her feet, Brooklyn is stronger, better prepared, and determined not to run. That is until she gets the call that her husband has been released from prison after serving his three years for DWI. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cain James has his wife on his mind, always. With his friend Donovan at his side, anything is possible. He can find her, bring her home, make her love him again. While Cain has serious anger issues, Donovan is much worse. Cain can’t control his friend's sick, twisted mind and even sicker actions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donovan has Cain's best interest at heart, and he'll do whatever it takes to help Cain bring his wife home—including murder. After his time in prison, Cain doesn’t want to hurt his wife again and becomes a man torn—divided between the darkness inside him, his twisted love, and his lifelong protector, Donovan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Cain tries to convince his wife that he’s changed, he watches the bodies hit the floor one by one at the hands of his sidekick. Enraged by his estranged wife’s new love and conflicted by his own anger and need to protect his family, Cain unravels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He can’t live without her, and he won’t let her live without him.</description>

She is more than human. &lt;br /&gt;Escaping to New Orleans on the heels of her broken heart, she begins to unravel the mystery of her life while discovering a love powerful enough to unleash an ancient power residing within herself.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With a touch of paranormal interference, a lost love seems to be working to help Perry and Manny find their happy ever after, while hinting that some things may not be as they seem.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years after the death of the first woman to hold his heart, Manny meets a woman who fires his desire to love again, but to do so, must he say goodbye the ghost of his first love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perry’s social anxiety causes her to isolate herself from everyone, including the man she’s inexplicably drawn to. As desperately as she wants to break free from her self-imposed prison, she can’t overcome her own insecurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manny is determined to prove to Perry she is worthy of love. And just when he thinks he has succeeded, he’s forced to keep a difficult promise that will forever impact their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a little divine intervention from Manny’s first love help Perry and Manny find their way to a happily ever after?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a veterinarian and a construction worker connect, it takes mishaps, mistakes, and a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Rex to show them they’re made for each other.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Carter Falon is content living a quiet life in a small town caring for his animal patients. That doesn't mean he's not looking for a distraction. After finding himself precariously wedged… naked and at the mercy of a drop-dead gorgeous construction worker, Carter hires his savior to renovate his home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Tanner Grady’s best friend and new niece needed him, he uprooted and relocated without a second thought. His life has since been centered on work and spending time with his family, but when he comes to the rescue of a cute vet, Tanner finds he's a lot more interested in the homeowner than the house he’s renovating. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Intimidating and living by a strong code of ethics, Table’s integrity is unwavering, as is his ironclad will when it comes to safeguarding those he cares about. He’s the man to guard your back, shelter you in time of need, and be the shield. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just don’t ever lie to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Table’s life is turned upside down when he unexpectedly discovers he’s a dad. Trying to navigate his life as a single father to a baby girl, he takes a break from his Dragon Runners MC brothers, moving to the family farm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Table meets nomadic Lori, who trades work on the farm for rent, he’s as intrigued as he is wary. She’s a woman who wears her attitude like armor. And despite her fierce independence, Table can see the fear dancing in the shadows of her eyes. It’s enough to make him look that little bit closer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the support of his MC brothers, Table not only is reminded that family is more than blood, but that some women are just worth fighting for.</description>

  <description>*Warning: This book contains strong sexual content and graphic violence, it is not suitable for persons under the age of 18. &lt;br /&gt;After the brutal kidnapping of her brother, Tessa Roberts, a human born with the ability to read other human minds, plunges herself into the dark and mysterious world of the Breed, hell bent on finding him. What she encounters however, is far more than she bargained for. Vampires and werewolves are one race known as the Breed, and are locked in a centuries old war against vicious human Hunters. With the help of Casstiel, the fierce leader of the Breed's defense team who carries a fiery passion for her, can she find her brother before the war erupts on their doorstep? Or will lies and betrayals end the new life she's forged for herself, along with the lives of everyone she loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What do you do when you keep losing time?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrifying visions torment Starra. Lost moments of time and flashes of images too horrific to accept fill her with icy fear so complete she can’t escape it. With too many unanswered questions, she needs answers. Now. It’s her only hope if she wants to save what’s left of her shattered mind and soul. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Unlike Starra, Mina cares nothing for her soul. Damned long ago, she’s too scarred for redemption. There are people meant to enjoy lives of love and family and friends. Mina isn’t one of these people. Her life is in the shadows, unafraid of the dark... until she realizes that something lurks in those shadows, something that wants to tear her apart. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One never knows what the darkness hides...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Their love is a legacy of broken hearts and shattered dreams. Can they find each other without losing themselves?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He is everything I want but know I can never have.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every fiber of my being has ached for Luke from the very first moment we met. However, with my parents’ legacy of toxic obsession woven into my DNA, I know love is pain and should be avoided at all costs. I'm unloved and unlovable. Still, in moments of weakness, I allow myself to imagine what it would be like if I was the kind of woman who deserved the love of a man like him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She is hiding in plain sight, waiting for me to find her.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marnie has had my heart from day one, and always will. It's just a shame I couldn’t muster the words to tell her so when we first locked eyes. It's a failing I will live to regret for years to come. However, I'm determined to make things right, even if it takes me a lifetime. I need her to know she is enough. In fact, she is more than that. She is everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An independent blonde seeking a fresh start.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and unhappy, Ally Hunter makes a life-changing decision to move across the country to a small town that once felt like home. As she reinvents herself, she realizes there’s one part of the equation missing—love. However, a tragedy from the past makes her hesitate when it comes to giving up her heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A betrayed man looking for a sense of pride.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by his first love and family, Ronan has one friend he can truly count on—his two-hundred-pound mastiff, Henry. When he returns home from service in the National Guard, though, he finds his entire life catapulted in a different direction with the disappearance of his beloved dog.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A loyal four-legged friend who will unexpectedly bring them together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Henry, Ronan’s brindle mastiff, finds himself far from home, Ronan sets out on a journey to bring him back. However, as the trail to Henry leads Ronan to Ridgewood, Virginia, and an interior designer with a big heart, he’ll realize some hardships lead to beautiful discoveries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Trail to You is a sweet stand-alone romantic novel.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Join hot cowboy Levi and quirky author Jodie this Thanksgiving in a fun short story of heat, cringe-worthy families, and dramas of the heart.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“You’re out of control,” I say as he leads me back to some cryptic place behind the rodeo. “And you love it,” he murmurs, turning to kiss me, his hands wandering, making me thankful in all sorts of ways for a very Texan and very scandalous Thanksgiving rodeo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Levi Creed, the sexy cowboy, takes Jodie Ellison home for a true Texan Thanksgiving, she has no idea what kind of rowdy holiday she’s in for. As Levi and Jodie’s families unite for one crazy dinner, Jodie uncovers Levi’s roots. Will the scorching Texas heat unite their already smoldering hearts, or will elements of Levi’s past prove to be too much for the new couple?</description>

  <description>Ocean lives in a world where water is scarce. Her village names all of their females after water, in hopes of gaining favor with the Fates. For every 20 years a Water Blessed is chosen. Someone who can create water at will. Men take multiples water wives with the sole purpose of fetching water 10 miles away from the dangerous and crowded well. When Ocean finds herself being auctioned off to the highest bidder, Seth, a royal knight, changes her life forever. But what the Fates have in store for Ocean might prove too much and sometimes love isn't enough.</description>

  <description>MM Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scottie Kinland works as the Kennel Manager for the Paws For Care veterinary clinic. Spending his days with animals is the only way he can feel safe. He has first-hand knowledge of how cold and calculating humans can be. How could he ever forget? He wears the scars on his face and his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lance Franklin likes to play the field. Still reeling from a lying cheating fiancée, he’s plowing through men like aspirin; only the pain of betrayal still stings. When he takes his mom’s dog in to the Paws For Care clinic, he’s immediately drawn to the quiet loner Scottie. But Scottie wants nothing to do with Lance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lance persists and he manages to forge a fragile relationship with Scottie. But just as both me begin to believe perhaps fate has something beautiful in store for them; the past collides with their future in a shocking way. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Danial “Nial” Rourke is the oldest son of a criminal shifter family, but wants nothing to do with the family business. As a rare pureblood shifter with no abilities, he's treated as human and is able to live a relatively normal life. One night out with his brother to celebrate his graduation changes everything. Now, Nial is a convicted murderer and his pureblood status means he'll be going to Starke Penitentiary for criminal beasts. The high stone walls, human prejudice, and the worst of the shifter world make it a deadly place for someone like Nial. If his father can't pull some strings and get Nial protection, he'll never make his next birthday alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ezekiel “Ze” de Koening is Nial's only chance for survival. He's gruff, intimidating, and a rare lion shifter, indifferent one minute and protective the next. But Ze soon seems to grow fond of his new cellmate, saying Nial's too pretty and weak to survive on his own. He'll babysit, for now. Just when things seem to settle into a routine, Nial is forced to confide in his protector. He’s much more than he claims to be, and he's holding onto some deep secrets. And Nial is sure Ze is keeping secrets of his own. Secrets that could be deadly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the violence inside escalates, and their world unexpectedly explodes, there’s only one way out for either of them. Through an unimaginable trial, freedom finally comes. But freedom will come with an unexpected price, neither one was prepared to pay.</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling Author Kat Cantrell (writing as K. Cantrell) -- All three books in the Olympia Alien Mail Order Bride series: Eros, Ares and Ajax together in one set! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Looking for Love on all the Wrong Planets &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eros &lt;br /&gt;Penelope Boswell needs a fake boyfriend to save her from her meddling family. But when the Intergalactic Dating Agency matches her with a sexy alien willing to play pretend in exchange for her help assimilating to Earth culture, she gets way more than she bargained for: Eros is seductive, pushy and has no intention of faking anything, least of all their relationship… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ares &lt;br /&gt;Clementine Daily has struck out so many times in the dating game that she’s had to move on to another species. When the Intergalactic Dating Agency matches her to a Torvian who needs a marriage of convenience to stay on Earth, she’s happy to help—who wouldn’t love a sexy alien as a reward? Except her new husband is scarred by secrets from the past and wants nothing to do with love or romance, and Clem's seduction strategy suddenly needs a whole new game plan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ajax &lt;br /&gt;When Brooklyn Carter flees from an abusive ex, a friend suggests the perfect bodyguard—an honest-to-goodness alien. Ajax is built like a tank, willing to do the job in exchange for a green card marriage, and best of all, he can't and won't touch her. His genetic modifications give him super strength, which means he carefully avoids all contact with fragile humans. But once they start spending time together, Brooklyn begins to wonder what it would be like if he could touch her. Now all she can think about is exactly that… and how to trade safety for the courage to go after what she wants.</description>

It made each story have enough uniqueness, along with the different plot arcs to make each a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />Great escapism!]]>

  <description>Erotic Novella: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Tristan took a dishwashing job at the Black Ribbon strip club, he expected five weekends of work and enough money to cover his bills until school started up again. He didn’t expect to meet the sex god Cade Rue and be lured in by the man’s inherent sexual magnetism. What began as innocent flirting and lots of day dreaming, on Tristan’s part, turned into the sexual night of Tristan’s life. Will this be just a one night stand or will it be so much more. If Cade’s wolf has anything to say about it, this encounter will lead to forever.</description>

  <description>When Sci-Fi Geek lands Sophisticated and Sexy, fan fiction dreams can come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tech billionaire Michael Jones has always been a stereotypical geek at heart. Shy, socially uninterested, and crazy for Star Wars, he’s spent years creating a mask that helped him become the rags-to-riches phenomenon of the century. &lt;br /&gt;There’s just one person who can crack the façade. One person who turns him into an incoherent, bumbling mess: James Jennings. &lt;br /&gt;The sophisticated older brother of Michael’s best friend, James has been the centre of Michael’s fantasies from the moment they met. But those dreams can never come true, because why would a suave, successful, wealthy businessman want someone who’s just faking his way through life?</description>

  <description>Sometimes love takes balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly retired championship footballer Simon Wood is taking on his next challenge. His plan for a charity to provide funding for underprivileged children to pursue football as a career has passed its first hurdle: he has backers and an executive consultant. Now it’s time to get the ball rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucien Morel, heir to the multibillion-euro Morel Corporation, is shocked—and thrilled—to learn his father has volunteered him as consultant to a fledgling football charity. Better yet, the brains behind it all is heartthrob Simon Wood, his teenage idol and crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Simon and Lucien get off on the wrong foot, it’s not long before they’re getting along like a house on fire—sparks included. But with the charity under public scrutiny, can their romance thrive?</description>

  <description>A May-to-December MMM Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's the perfect recipe for an emotional MMM romance? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One autistic coffee shop owner, one morose mug maker, and a mostly cheerful police detective.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fie Morogh Russell goes off to war with a broken heart and returns with a shattered spirit. He hermits away in Bideford, Devon, making mugs, with his service dog, Haggard, for company. Post-traumatic stress turns every memory into a minefield, and life is dismal with one or two rare exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Davet Heuse drags his younger brother to Bideford for a new start. Both autistic, the two siblings have fought hard to enjoy freedom by the seaside. While Davet runs a coffee shop from his tiny house, his brother pursues his dream at university. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Sidney Little has transitioned from military service to the police force easily. His unrequited crushes and his estranged father are the only points of frustration in his life. He hasn't quite figured out how to deal with either problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a tragic accident brings Davet's world crashing down around him, can Fie and Sid help him through the pain of loss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In this May-December romance with a twist, three men struggle through one obstacle after the other to somehow find themselves in love on the other side.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Shaken to his core, the loss was excruciating… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jackson Sawyer was strong, confident, cocky, and arrogant, but when he loved, he loved hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Sawyer family was faced with a tragedy that rocked their foundation. Jackson, however, was hit the hardest. He’s the one who can't seem to rise above the grief. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has overtaken him… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he finds Bailey Whitmore. She also has a darkness she just can't shake. Yet she hides it well—tucking her sadness away, and shadowing it with a spunky attitude. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But those demons have a way of showing up when you least expect it… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love is intense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loss is inevitable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pain and anger are unavoidable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will they find the strength to rebuild their tainted hearts together? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or will it go against…Jackson’s Destiny?</description>

  <description>One of the hardest things I have ever had to do was bury my wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second hardest thing would be watching my twelve-year-old daughter fall to her knees as they lowered her mother into the ground to rest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A heart-wrenching vision that will forever be etched in my mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Claire was my best friend—she had been since we were barely old enough to talk. I always knew, one day, I would marry her. I think I may have even told her that a few times while we were growing up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never did I think I would lose her so suddenly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I knew at that moment… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our life would never be the same again… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A vampire desperate to escape his past. A wolf shifter determined to protect her future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A killer on the loose.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One year ago, wolf shifter Emma accepted her dream job teaching PE at a Norwegian international school, finally freeing herself from her mother’s incessant matchmaking. As the alpha’s heir, walking away from her pack, from her obligations—potentially even her fated mate—weighed heavy on her heart. But deep down, she knew it was the right decision. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, her sacrifice may have been for nothing—because the new history teacher has fangs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a reputation for kidnapping and selling shifters to research labs, a vampire is the last thing Emma needs in her life, but she refuses to be intimidated. This is her territory and she’s not going anywhere, so that grumpy, gorgeous vampire can &lt;i&gt;suck it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forced together at a prestigious boarding school, two supernatural enemies are torn between ripping each other's clothes off… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ripping each other apart.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eager for a fresh start, vampire Calder accepts an invitation to teach history at a private school above the Arctic Circle. Its remote location appeals to his sensibilities, and years of practice have taught him how to charm his human colleagues, but a certain gym teacher is seriously trying his last nerve. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All Calder wants to do is teach, so if the strikingly beautiful shifter refuses to see him as anything but the big bad vampire, perhaps he ought to lean into the part and really give her a show. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As summer turns to winter, humans disappear from nearby villages, gone without a trace and presumed missing—or worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing is certain: there are dark days ahead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even for creatures of the night.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Days is a standalone enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance duet. While Book 1 has a cliffhanger, all will be resolved with a supernatural happily-ever-after in Book 2.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes, the end is only the beginning.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emmy was born a dweller and she expected to die as a dweller ... until Willa changed everything. Now she has no idea of her path, and she certainly wasn't prepared for what would happen after her death. Caught in the middle of a war that threatened to prove much more significant than anyone had ever expected, there is only one person who can help her ... but his terms are steep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cyrus was born out of necessity: a being of light, brought to life with a singular purpose. Time has changed him and the recent events have unsettled him … but a certain transformed dweller is about to do much worse than that. She is about to turn his existence upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Topia is giving them no choice: they survive together, or the war is lost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a NOVELLA, over 30,000 words. Book 4.5 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Fabulous</strong><br /><br />It was such a great treat to have this novella and seeing not only the plot development but alternative perspectives. Emmy is such a fun character and Neutral is wonderfully dry. Together, they provided an entertaining read. ]]>

  <description>MANSERVANT - I just wanted an easy summer job… That didn’t happen. Now, I’m in a living nightmare as I work alongside this monster of a man with mesmerizing emerald eyes that look at me inappropriately every time I see him. To add insult to injury, he has a tan I just want to lick, and a butt worth drooling over every time he purposefully walks by me. But, he's an asshat, and looks are everything. I mean, aren't. LOOKS. ARE. NOT. EVERYTHING. Why do I have to keep reminding myself of this? &lt;br /&gt;His job is to clean, cook, and tend to the house we work in. That's why I call him the manservant. Oh, and because it drives him nuts. That's what he gets for torturing me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MAN FLU - I was trying to live every woman's dream, except my reality has been nothing but a nightmare job and a divorce at the age of thirty-two. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, my ex-husband, Rick, moved in next door with his life-size Barbie doll. So, that's been fun. &lt;br /&gt;Then, life pitched me a curve-ball in the form of a retired major-league baseball player, Logan Grier. With his panty-dropping smile, he’s like an expertly photoshopped version of David Beckham, and he's single. Could life be perfect after all? Of course not. As always, there had to be a catch. Logan had a secret, and I couldn’t help feeling like the truth was dangling right in front of my face. &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the “man flu” has come out of nowhere and hit both Logan and Rick with a virus they’re claiming to be worse than childbirth. In fact, they’re pretty sure their end is near.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MAN HANDLER - I’m a Boston girl through and through, but when I was given an ultimatum that would determine whether I’d have income or not, I opted for the option with a roof over my head. The only problem was, I had to move down to a small town in South Carolina, leaving behind the only place I’ve ever called home.  &lt;br /&gt;Some may not consider my move to be a big deal, but it turns out that having a big mouth and being mildly impatient isn’t quite acceptable in small town. In other words, I pretty much stick out like a sore thumb, which is great when unknowingly attracting the most eligible bachelor in town.  &lt;br /&gt;There’s nothing quite like being mistaken for a damsel in distress and fainting in this man’s arms ... then saying a whole bunch of stupid things I’d regret later. &lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Austin isn’t like the other kind-natured locals; he’s a little dirty, kind of arrogant, and a way too good-looking for his own good. In fact, we’re a bit like-minded with our attitudes, which causes a futile encounter that leads to a pair of handcuffs in a restaurant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MAN BUNS - I got out of the Marine Corps to give my daughter a better life. I’m a strong and capable single dad. I got this, right? Not so much. &lt;br /&gt;The one thing my daughter wants is the hardest to find—a mom. It’s not like they’re selling hot intelligent women at Walmart these days, and with the amount of baggage I’m carrying around, I might be out of luck. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, so. &lt;br /&gt;We moved from Oahu to Maui. I needed a job, a place to live, and to get us settled. I thought it would be simple, but let’s just say ... mistakes have been made.    &lt;br /&gt;· Mistake #1:  I took the first job I was offered. (Should’ve probably asked a couple more questions about the required uniform.) &lt;br /&gt;· Mistake #2: I flirted with Kai, the first attractive woman who crossed my path. (So far out of my league she might as well be a Hawaiian princess.) &lt;br /&gt;·Mistake #3: I fell head over heels for that woman. (See Mistake #2.) &lt;br /&gt;Now I’m standing here showing my butt—no, literally.</description>

  <description>After years of abuse, Daniela Reyes escapes her marriage to strike out on her own. With a rented house near the wilderness and a sexy neighbor down the road, life seems typical until she finds a black bear snoozing in her new hammock. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite warnings, she feeds her wild friend and watches him return day after day. Her bear is the ideal distraction from the ex who &lt;b&gt;won’t&lt;/b&gt; let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Russell Hawkins&lt;/i&gt; has dedicated his entire life to &lt;b&gt;protecting&lt;/b&gt; others. When the death of his wife drives him to retire from the Army, he settles in a remote community for the peace, quiet, and privacy to be himself. As a werebear, he roams the woods with his dog, the perfect diversion from his grief -- and the &lt;b&gt;voluptuous divorcee&lt;/b&gt; down the lane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can a war vet with a secret and a woman with a painful past find their happy future together?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author's Note: Be prepared for adult language and a sexy BBW heroine. All scenes are between consenting adults.&lt;i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ATTENTION&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a standalone, but each story will feature a different war hero. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Right to Bear Arms - Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;Let Us Prey - Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;The Purr-fect Soldier - Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;and more to come...&lt;i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>An erotic paranormal romance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charismatic and powerful Lyceum Wolves' Alpha, Tristan Livingston, is out for revenge after a devastating attack on his pack. Not only did he survive a building collapse, he orchestrated the rebuild of his chic, state-of-the-art nightclub within a week. Determined to mete out justice, he rescues a beautiful witness who may be the key to helping him find the perpetrators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kalli Williams, dedicated veterinarian, is hiding a secret that endangers not only her own life but the lives of wolves across the country. After being tortured by a savage vampire, she's reluctantly agrees to help the sexy Alpha in his quest to identify suspects; ones who'd kill her on the spot if they knew she existed. As Kalli places herself in the hands of the dominant wolf, she soon finds she wants nothing more than to submit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristan, committed to ruling his pack as a lone wolf, is inexplicably drawn to the mysterious and enticing woman, who seems more than human, but not quite supernatural. As he discovers her secret, he teaches her the meaning of trust, helping her learn how to be true to her nature. After living a lifetime alone, will he succumb to the visceral need to claim her, acknowledging the soul binding connection between an Alpha and his mate? And will he prevail against the menacing enemy who threatens to destroy Lyceum Wolves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains several erotic love scenes, including m/f/m menage, and is intended for adult readers only.</description>

  <description>2nd Edition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important things in Simon Murray’s life are football, friends, and film—in that order. His friends despair of him ever meeting someone, but despite his loneliness, Simon is cautious about looking for more. Then his best friends drag him to a party, where he barges into a football conversation and ends up defending the honour of star forward Declan Tyler—unaware that the athlete is present. In that first awkward meeting, neither man has any idea they will change each other's lives forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like his entire family, Simon revels in living in Melbourne, the home of Australian Rules football and mecca for serious fans. There, players are treated like gods—until they do something to fall out of public favour. This year, the public is taking Declan to task for suffering injuries outside his control, so Simon's support is a bright spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Simon and Declan fumble toward a relationship, keeping Declan's homosexuality a secret from well-meaning friends and an increasingly suspicious media becomes difficult. Nothing can stay hidden forever. Soon Declan will have to choose between the career he loves and the man he wants, and Simon has never been known to make things easy—for himself or for others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Edition published by Dreamspinner Press (March 2009)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Promising forever isn’t always easy, even when you’ve found Mr. Right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How could we be anything but forever to each other when our lives are so irresolutely melded together?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Avery Johannas swore she wouldn’t give her heart to another man again—and then Jesse Pearce changed her mind. Now, with wedding bells getting ready to ring, Avery’s relying on her friends to get her through all the hectic wedding planning. However, she’ll have to let go of the past in order to say “I do” one more time and take the risk again. &lt;br /&gt;Avery and Jesse’s relationship isn’t the only one changing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reed’s role as wedding planner makes Lysander realize all he is missing. With wedding fever in the ocean air, will the two be ready to take the next big step as well—or will Lysander be left craving the promise of forever? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the couples from Midsummer Nights get ready for Avery’s big day, they’ll pull together in a memorable way—and the surprise twist up their sleeves is sure to make fans of the Lines in the Sand series swoon. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Talon Shaw and I am the alpha of a pride of black panthers. My cat finds his mate in a human female and she wants a date! Panthers don’t date…we mate.&lt;br /&gt;Before my plans fall into place to court the woman who is destined to be my mate, one of my pride is taken and held for ransom.&lt;br /&gt;That ransom is me.&lt;br /&gt;I will do anything for my pride, but my little human mate puts herself in my place. When I find out that she has been taken, along with a young girl from my pride, I vow to bring them both home. My Guardians and I hunt to find my mate, save my pride, and deal out justice for those my enemy has harmed.&lt;br /&gt;That is…if I’m not too late to save them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; One Summer Can Change Everything...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topher Carlisle's always been the black sheep--literally--in his middle-class family. Biracial, gay, and genderfluid, his family doesn't think he'll amount to much, and he just might believe them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bout of severe depression has put both his academic and financial prospects in danger, he accepts his best friend's offer to stay in her family's summer home while he works to make up the shortfall of his athletic scholarship. But his tendency for self-sabotage is strong and soon a terrible mistake in judgment leaves him homeless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment he sees Topher, artist Jace Sieger knows that this is someone he needs to capture on canvas. He's no stranger to poor life choices, and he sees something in Topher worth nurturing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge, though, is chipping through Topher's prickly defenses to reach the sensitive, traumatized soul beneath. With the help of his friends Geoff and Robin, maybe, just maybe, they can convince Topher he's worth something after all, and that a few mistakes don't make him irredeemable. What starts as a casual vacation fling grows into something that will change both of them forever. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This novel is a newly-released and retitled second edition. It was previously available under the title &lt;/i&gt;Saugatuck Summer.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>A Christmas Shifter Story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine "Kat" Strudwick convinces herself this Christmas will be like all the other ones before it where she is stuck in the middle of the hell of purgatory that is unrequited love. At twenty-four, she avoids the object of her affection by remaining in her shifter form—a feather-tailed glider. She has no idea this Christmas is going to be different from all the others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Declan Garrett is a man who knows who he is and what he wants. He’s known for several years Kat is his mate, but rather than pursuing her, he honoured his best friend’s request to wait. As a scientific researcher, he knows all about the value of patience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Christmas, Declan is ready to show Kat that they belong together by courting her polar bear shifter style. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The gifts are purchased. His plans are set. Now he can only hope the little mouse doesn’t lead him on too long of a chase.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Embrace the danger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean Rush is an adrenaline junkie. That’s why he was in the Army, why he steals and races classic muscle cars . . . and why he can’t stay away from bad boy Ryker, a Havoc Motorcycle Club lieutenant. Fortunately, Ryker can’t seem to stay away from Sean—he’s spent the last eight months breaking into Sean’s apartment and stealing into his bed, leaving Sean physically satisfied but increasingly restless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean has always avoided relationships. He likes to come and go without being controlled. And Ryker is possibly the most controlling man he’s ever known. Still, he finds that he wants more from Ryker than their silent nighttime encounters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one of Sean’s thefts goes bad, and Ryker’s protective instincts kick into overdrive. He takes Sean to the Havoc compound, determined to keep him safe. But Sean’s past threatens the safety of Havoc—and everything Ryker holds dear. Worse, Ryker’s hiding secrets of his own. Soon it’s obvious that the adrenaline rush can’t keep them together anymore. But maybe love can.</description>

  <description>Lucy London puts the word genius to shame. Having obtained her PhD in microbiology by the age of twenty, she's amassed a wealth of knowledge, but one subject still eludes her—people. The pendulum of passions experienced by those around her both confuses and intrigues her, so when she’s offered a grant to study emotion as a pathogen, she jumps on the opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her attempts to come up with an actual experiment quickly drop from lackluster to nonexistent, she’s given a choice: figure out how to conduct a groundbreaking study on passion, or lose both the grant and her position at the university. Put on leave until she can crack the perfect proposal, she finds there’s only one way she can study emotions—by experiencing them herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Jensen Walker, Lucy's neighbor and the one person on the planet she finds strangely and maddeningly appealing. Jensen's life is the stuff of campus legend, messy, emotional, complicated—in short, the perfect starting point for Lucy's study. When her tenaciousness wears him down and he consents to help her, sparks fly. To her surprise, Lucy finds herself battling with her own emotions, as foreign as they are intense. With the clock ticking on her deadline, Lucy must decide what's more important: analyzing her passions...or giving in to them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wilder&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, Logan left me. He told me that two Alphas cannot be together, he told me that our mating wasn’t real. &lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, my sister called me and told me that Logan passed away, leaving behind an Omega and a child. &lt;br /&gt;Today, I’m at Logan’s funeral. Why am I offering to look after his little family? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sterling&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Logan and I had everything we wanted: a house, a beautiful daughter and lots of big dreams. Then he was ripped away from us in a car crash. &lt;br /&gt;His family is too busy to help me out after the funeral, so one of Logan’s old friends steps in. &lt;br /&gt;Only, in all the commotion, I didn’t keep an eye on the calendar, and my heat starts at the most inconvenient of times. &lt;br /&gt;And why is Logan’s friend reacting to my heat? Only true mates are supposed to react to a mated Omega... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first episode of &lt;b&gt;Second Chance Mates&lt;/b&gt;, which takes place in a non-shifter Omegaverse world and contains mpreg (male-pregnancy).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A high-society wedding planner, a hunky best man, and an enchanted elevator… who can resist An Irish Flirtation? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jillian Baxter has worked hard to build her event planning business, and this wedding is proof that she’s made it. The problem? The bride redefines bridezilla. After months of work, Jillian now has three weeks to move a huge society wedding from New York to an Irish castle. &lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Castle Tullamore Hotel is available. Although… it’s a bit odd. When Jillian arrives and meets the groom’s brother, Fin, it’s almost like magic steps in. She knows bridezilla would never stand for fraternization, but despite doing her best to keep her distance, Jillian finds herself unable to resist Fin… especially in that damn elevator! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: This is a revamped, substantially longer version of an earlier book, and is available as part of the Emerald Isle Enchantment boxed set.</description>

  <description>Drake Morgan has kept his family secret from the humans for eternity, having no desire to put their existence out into the open like the other shifterkind. He lives a solitary life with his two brothers hidden on his farm deep in the backwoods of Northern Mississippi. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every spring, their bears call to prepare their home for the arrival of a mating season. The search for their mates begins, and Drake has to rethink his disgust of humans when one of their females show up on his land, scenting of his destined mate. Morgan’s bear demands he keep her for himself, but he knows she will never accept his true nature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tessa Ward moved to this little town to hide from her abusive ex, taking two jobs to pay rent and put food on the table. Her position at the local parts store sends her into the heart of the country to make one simple delivery to the local farmer, Drake Morgan. Upon arrival, she is thrown into the world of the paranormal after one touch from the bear shifter and she finds out his true nature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mating season has arrived, and Drake is prepared to fight for the woman who is fated to be his bride. When his mate’s ex comes lurking around his sacred property, Drake will stop at nothing until his female is safe, even if it means killing a human…not that he cares for them anyway. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As an orphan ward of the Sisterhood, eighteen-year-old Kalinda is destined for nothing more than a life of seclusion and prayer. Plagued by fevers, she’s an unlikely candidate for even a servant’s position, let alone a courtesan or wife. Her sole dream is to continue living in peace in the Sisterhood’s mountain temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a visit from the tyrant Rajah Tarek disrupts Kalinda’s life. Within hours, she is ripped from the comfort of her home, set on a desert trek, and ordered to fight for her place among the rajah’s ninety-nine wives and numerous courtesans. Her only solace comes in the company of her guard, the stoic but kind Captain Deven Naik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with the danger of a tournament to the death—and her growing affection for Deven—Kalinda has only one hope for escape, and it lies in an arcane, forbidden power buried within her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Emily R. King’s thrilling fantasy debut, an orphan girl blossoms into a warrior, summoning courage and confidence in her fearless quest to upend tradition, overthrow an empire, and reclaim her life as her own.</description>

  <description>Book 4 in The Deadwood Hunter Series, set 2 years after the end of Holocaust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured and returning to her own life, Alice remains damaged. Two years later, and in her mind, she's still there—caught in a war she had no place in. When her worst fear turns into reality, instead of seeking help, Alice heads down the road to self-destruction, running from all she's known and loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as lion shifter Jared meets Alice, he’s compelled to help her. What he doesn't realize is that he's as lost as she is. Their chance meeting leads them to a path of danger, love, and self-discovery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood will be spilled, friendships reborn, and buried emotions will be unearthed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read this next installment of the Deadwood Hunter series and find out if life really can go on after war.</description>

  <description>Don’t look back. Don’t you ever look back… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shy tattoo artist Ash has a troubled past. Years of neglect, drug abuse, and life on the streets have taken their toll, and sometimes it seems the deep, unspoken bond with his lover is the only balm for wounds he doesn’t quite understand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chicago paramedic Pete is warmth, love, and strength—things Ash never knew he could have, and never even knew he wanted until Pete showed him. But fate is a cruel, cruel mistress, and when nightmares collide with the present, their tentatively built world comes crashing down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Traumatic events in Pete’s work life distance him from home, and he doesn’t realize until it’s too late that Ash has slipped away. Betrayal, secrets, and lies unfold, and when a devastating coincidence takes hold, Pete must fight with all he has to save the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The shifter world is dying. At least, that’s how it looks to Hunter. Whole packs are losing the ability to change form and the talents of shifters are starting to sound like myth and legend. &lt;p&gt;But Hunter can’t take on the problems of his world, not when his own troubles are much closer to home. When his uncle demands he choose a mate or be kicked out of the pack, Hunter knows there must be some way around it. He’s too young to settle down, especially not with someone he barely knows. And then he catches sight of an omega in a cage and comes up with a plan to help them both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cade just wants to go home. He hadn’t planned on being abducted by wolves, locked in a cage, and forced into a mating. So much for shifter hospitality. When he catches the attention of Zane, a dangerous, unstable alpha, he knows he needs a champion. Enter Hunter, a dormant alpha shifter with a temper, who wants Cade for reasons the omega doesn’t understand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cade is determined to make a break for it and escape to the safety of his den. But when Hunter risks everything for him, even his life, Cade can’t just turn his back on him. Not with his growing feelings for the alpha. Saving Hunter turns both their lives upside down, revealing a secret Cade has done his best to keep hidden; within the dens, the shifter world is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; much alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Chosen is a novel-length read. Beware angst, happy endings, mpreg, littermates, bear puns, and scenes not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Willa Knight: The saviour of both worlds, or the destruction of everything?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes history lies, and the tales of Minatsol and Topia are no different. Since the birth of Topia, Staviti has woven a web of deceit around the truth of Creation, striving only to maintain his power while destroying anything that gets in his way. Now, Willa and the Abcurses are determined to strip back the layers, to uncover the truth, and to understand the true nature of the two worlds before it's too late. &lt;br /&gt;The only problem? &lt;br /&gt;Any wrong step in their quest to restore balance might have terrible repercussions. Every single being—living or dead—might have to pay the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 5 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Epic Conclusion</strong><br /><br />One of my all-time favourite series has drawn to a spectacular end. Intense, fast-paced, and deliciously sexy, Pain and the series in its entirety has been addictive and offered the perfect escapism. Brilliant writing from the two authors. ]]>

  <description>This edition is out of print. For the current Kindle edition see &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48279453.Ravensong" title="Ravensong" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ravensong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sequel to Wolfsong&lt;br /&gt;A Green Creek Novel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gordo Livingstone never forgot the lessons carved into his skin. Hardened by the betrayal of a pack who left him behind, he sought solace in the garage in his tiny mountain town, vowing never again to involve himself in the affairs of wolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was, until the wolves came back, and with them, Mark Bennett. In the end, they faced the beast together as a pack… and won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a year later, Gordo has found himself once again the witch of the Bennett pack. Green Creek has settled after the death of Richard Collins, and Gordo constantly struggles to ignore Mark and the song that howls between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But time is running out. Something is coming. And this time, it’s crawling from within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bonds, no matter how strong, were made to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two hot-shot hockey players are about to clash in Genevive Chamblee’s sexy M/M romance Defending the Net. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brighton Rabalais only wants to play hockey. He’s uninterested in the politics behind the sport, but his recruiting to the Saint Anne’s Civets is as much about politics as it is his hockey abilities. He’s been hired to replace the enigmatic, three-time champion, veteran goalie, Gatien Glesseau, who happens to be as sexy as he is talented. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their clashing is inevitable, but Brighton can’t get a read on Gatien. However, with his own secrets a concern, Brighton doesn’t need another complication. But when Gatien threatens to invade Brighton’s privacy, Brighton defends his heart with the same vigor and passion as he does the net.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hot deputy, a woman in hiding, and a murder that changes it all. True love and the truth are often at odds in Mary Billiter’s latest installment in her resort romance series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feds changed her name, occupation, and location, but Cupid and crime still found her. Both Witness Protection and her position as a hotel conference services manager require Rebel Roberts to maintain a low profile. But when she finds herself at the center of high crime and high romance at the high-rise Point Resort in Long Beach, even the best-laid plans are subject to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former college baseball pitcher Ryan McHenry plans on becoming a deputy sheriff like his late uncle. But when Rebel literally stumbles on a dead body by her hotel, helping her change the narrative may throw a curve in his career plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Rebel and Ryan find true love and happiness with so many lies between them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Not all secrets can stay hidden when it comes to love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“All along, Reed Wilder’s been this crazy rebel just waiting for me to let my guard down. And so, here we are, standing at the bar waiting to get the party started.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sexy entrepreneur Lysander Wyatt has always believed in happily-ever-after thanks to his picture-perfect family. Now orphaned, he’s made a family of his own at his popular beach bar, Midsummer Nights. There’s just one thing missing—the forever kind of love he’s been looking for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reed Wilder, a guarded corporate man from Philadelphia, is looking for himself when he moves to Ocean City, Maryland. However, a rocky childhood makes him afraid of commitment. When he walks into Midsummer Nights and meets the attractive bartender who owns it, he’ll have to decide if love might actually be worth the risk. Will Lysander and Reed get on the same page about commitment, or will they continue hiding the true desires and fears of their hearts? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This sweet m/m standalone 35,000-word novella is also a prequel to the popular Lines in the Sand series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How much weight can a man take on his shoulders before he buckles?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blue’s life is in shambles.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He has to fight off his MC brotherhood on a drug problem threatening his town, balance his time as a father while dealing with a vicious custody battle with his ex, and somehow manage the huge load of responsibilities of his job. All the while, he is fighting his attraction to the quiet shopkeeper who lives just across the street from him. The last thing he wants is to take her down with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm’s life is uneventful.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally healed after the heartache of losing her husband, kind-souled Psalm throws herself into her store and rescuing dogs. Her crush on Blue can be traced back to high school so many years ago, and even after being widowed, she still carries a torch for him. From the sidelines, she aches for Blue and his children. With her caring nature, she reaches out to him, over and over again, even when he pushes her away. Is Psalm’s heart strong enough to take on this broken man and heal him?</description>
