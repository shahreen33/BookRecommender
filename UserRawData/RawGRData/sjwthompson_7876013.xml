  <description>Nothing about being a librarian prepared Thuy Nguyen for such a wide variety of casseroles. Or life in a small town. Or becoming a farmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what can she do when her catastrophe-prone best friend begs her for help? After all, Maddy has always been there for Thuy. It’s time to return the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s simple really, all she has to do is: learn everything about farming ASAP, save her BBF’s family business from disaster, and avoid being caught staring at Maddy’s biker brother, and his muscles, and his smile, and his soulful, sexy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and she should definitely not fall in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, right? . . . Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Prose Before Bros' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book #3 in the Green Valley Library series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;La princesa de la literatura latinoamericana, está de regreso con la historia el legendario amor entre el conquistador Hernan Cortés y su intérprete, la india Malinalli. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;FonoLibro se enorgullece en presentar la nueva novela de la laureada escritora mexicana Laura Esquivel, Malinche, narrada por la laureada estrella mexicana Lucia Méndez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando Malinalli conoce a Cortés asume que se trata del propio Dios Quetzalcóatl que regresa a liberar a su pueblo. Los dos se enamoran apasionadamente, pero este amor pronto es destruido por la desmedida sed de conquista, poder y riqueza de Cortés. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lo largo de la historia de México Malinalli/Malinche ha sido conocida por su traición al pueblo indio. Pero recientes investigaciones históricas han mostrado que Malinalli fue la mediadora entre dos culturas, la hispánica y la americana nativa; y entre dos lenguas, el español y el náhuatl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo que Esquivel ha hecho aquí es desafiar la mitología tradicional mediante un retrato muy temperamental del Adán y la Eva de la cultura mestiza, Cortés y Malinalli, con la caída del imperio azteca como telón de fondo. Contada con el lirismo de la tradición cantarina y pictórica del náhuatl, Laura Esquivel nos brinda un mito fundacional de la cultura híbrida del Nuevo Mundo y una extraordinaria historia de amor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people—at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of&lt;i&gt; To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others&lt;/i&gt;) explains in his paradigm-shattering book &lt;i&gt;Drive&lt;/i&gt;, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; way to motivate people for today's challenges. In &lt;i&gt;Drive&lt;/i&gt;, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;Autonomy&lt;/b&gt;—the desire to direct our own lives&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;Mastery&lt;/b&gt;—the urge to get better and better at something that matters&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;Purpose&lt;/b&gt;—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drive&lt;/i&gt; is bursting with big ideas—the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.</description>

  <description>As a child Hester Wyatt escaped slavery, but now the dark skinned beauty is a dedicated member of Michigan's Underground railroad, offering other runaways a chance at the freedom she has learned to love. When one of her fellow conductors brings her an injured man to hide, Hester doesn't hesitate even after she is told about the price on his head. The man in question is the great conductor known as the "Black Daniel" a vital member of the north's Underground railroad network, but Hester finds him so rude and arrogant, she begins to question her vow to hide him.When the injured and beaten Galen Vachon, aka, the Black Daniel awakens in Hester's cellar, he is unprepared for the feisty young conductor providing his care. As a member of one of the wealthiest free Black families in New Orleans, Galen has turned his back on the lavish living he is accustomed to in order to provide freedom to those enslaved in the south. However, as he heals he cannot turn his back on Hester Wyatt. Her innocence fills him like a breath of fresh air and he is determined to make her his, but traitors have to be found, slave catchers have to be routed and Hester's refusal to trust her own heart have to be overcome before she and Galen can find the freedom only love can bring.</description>

  <description>Eden Wing is a brilliant student. He’s about to graduate a year early from Ross University of the Sciences, with honors, and already has an internship lined up back in the Republic. But most people don’t introduce Eden this way. Instead, they say, “This is Eden, Daniel Wing’s younger brother.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, Eden’s brother Daniel was known as Day, the boy from the streets who led a revolution that saved the Republic of America. His name was spray-painted on walls, his profile splashed on both rebel pamphlets and wanted posters. He went from being a hunted criminal to a national hero in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day has spent the past decade piecing together his memory of his time in the Republic, pretending to enjoy life in Antarctica’s capital, Ross City , and quietly hiding out from the world—even if it’s meant giving up June, the great love of his life. As long as he can keep his little brother safe, that’s all that matters . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Eden isn’t safe. As the two brothers struggle to accept who they’ve each become, they grow more distant from one another than they've ever been. Eden finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into Ross City’s dark side, until even his legendary brother can’t save him. At least not on his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When June suddenly steps back into Day’s life, rekindling the flames of their romance, the pair team up to do whatever it takes to rescue Eden. But like the rest of the world, they may have underestimated Eden—what he’s capable of, where his loyalties lie, and how hard he’s willing to fight for what he believes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unmatched suspense and her signature cinematic storytelling, #1 New York Times bestselling author Marie Lu plunges readers back into the unforgettable world of Legend—for the most thrilling adventure yet. A truly grand finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10:31:12</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Daunted by the singular sexual tastes and dark secrets of the beautiful, tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a Seattle publishing house. But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven, and demanding Fifty Shades. While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront her anger and envy of the women who came before her and make the most important decision of her life. Erotic, sparkling and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades Darker&lt;/i&gt; is the irresistibly addictive second part of the Fifty Shades trilogy.</description>

  <description>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Rian Thompson thought she joined the gym to get healthy. Little did she know she was about to add hundred and ninety pounds of swoonworthy abdominal muscles and arrogance to her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day in Rians’s life follows a predictable pattern, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. She’s got a nice job, a nice place to live, and a nice family – even if they are a little wedding-zilla-ish at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t need anything spectacular to be happy. She just needs to get healthy – mentally, physically. . . and maybe spiritually if that happens. But she’ll settle for two out of three until her sister finally gets hitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Davies thought his life was perfect. Little did he know it was about to be turned upside down by a woman who is not his type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Carlos’s mind, his life is damn near perfect. He’s got a great job, a great place to live, and a great stash of pick up lines that always work. It has occurred to him that maybe no one actually takes him all that seriously. But with these bulging biceps and thick, dark hair, does that even matter since he’s never sleeping alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Weight Expectations, where great—and unexpected—things happen.</description>

  <description>Steven Thompson had a bad year. A string of mean, kinky (the alarming kind, not the good kind), and crazy dating debacles combined with a boss who appears to be experiencing male-prenatal-psychosis means Steven’s stress levels are high. They’re so high, he’s decided to quit dating and focus instead solely on his job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he meets Dr. Ken Miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Ken Miles is having a fantastic year. His hard work is paying off in a big way... professionally. But his social life? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he meets Steven Thompson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven isn’t so sure about Dr. Miles, but Ken is one hundred percent certain about Mr. Thompson. And even though both men know full well that the key to getting what you want out of life is hard work, they can’t seem to make them—together—work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they ever get on the same page? Or just keep sticking to the same old script? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sticking to the Script' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book #2 in the Cipher Office series, Knitting in the City World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</description>

  <description>A man of few words, Ranger Jay Daniels values the calm, quiet solitude of the Great Smokey Mountains. Never quite fitting in with either side of his family, he prefers the company of birds and trees to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, he’d most definitely prefer a bird—any bird, any bird at all, take a vulture for instance—to the human-tornado hybrid that just blew onto his peaceful stretch of the Appalachian Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path of true love never has run smooth for Olive Perry. After getting dumped and promptly abandoned in the middle of her multi-month hike, Olive swears off men. Determined to finish the long trek by herself, she doesn’t need a prince—or broody and taciturn ranger—to save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, when an early snowstorm threatens the mountains, and Ranger Daniels is charged with getting hikers to safety, that includes hot-tempered Olive Perry. Snowed in and forced to share an abandoned cabin, can Olive’s heated intensity melt Jay’s cool reserve?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if so, will this happy trail lead to true love? Or will their time together be just another bump in the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Happy Trail' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Park Ranger series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</description>

  <description>In this follow-up to The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the author tells the story, based on a true one, of a woman who survives Auschwitz, only to find herself locked away again. Cilka Klein is 18 years old when Auschwitz-Birkenau is liberated by Soviet soldiers. But Cilka is one of the many women who is sentenced to a labor camp on charges of having helped the Nazis--with no consideration of the circumstances Cilka and women like her found themselves in as they struggled to survive. Once at the Vorkuta gulag in Sibera, where she is to serve her 15-year sentence, Cilka uses her wits, charm, and beauty to survive.</description>

  <description>How do you know if a risk is worth taking? If you knew, there wouldn’t be any risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a disastrous appearance on a televised baking show, Sophie Copeland is certain things can’t get any worse. Several calamities later, Sophie finds herself in Green Valley, Tennessee with no plan, no place to stay, and no prospects. But at least she has a temporary seasonal arrangement with the famed Donner Bakery. And that's something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not permanent, and it's not a home, but it's still something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Joel Barnes, a Green Valley mystery, wrapped in rumors, and a whispered connection to the local notorious biker gang. Joel’s got a name for being bad news, but he also has an apartment for rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by the dichotomy of Joel’s reputation and sexy southern pull, Sophie can’t help but be tempted, even though she knows—given her (bad) luck—she should stay far, far away. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet as everyone knows, without risk, there’s no reward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'No Whisk, No Reward' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book #3 in the Donner Bakery series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I'm Levi Buchanan, and until five years ago, I thought the legend of my family's curse was a load of crazy, Southern nonsense.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No curse can make you fall in love at first sight. No curse can force a true, deep, passionate, all-consuming love that will haunt you all the days of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met Jocelyn Abernathy and I realized how completely wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Jocelyn guards her feelings like well-armed soldier. She's the most beautiful, stubborn, infuriating woman I've ever met. Every time she talks, I want to kiss the living daylights out of her. But I can't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because when we met, she didn't need true love. She needed a best friend. And that's what I've been to her... for five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jocelyn meets a handsome stranger her first day working at Donner Bakery and she lets him buy her a dill pickle cupcake, I realize with ominous regret that I may have missed my window with my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;If I can't get her to see past our friendship, my new curse may be to watch the love of my life move on with someone else. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;'Baking Me Crazy' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book#1 in the Donner Bakery series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fascinating, beautifully illustrated guide to the monsters that are part of our collective psyche, from the host of the hit podcast Lore, soon to be an online streaming series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They live in shadows--deep in the forest, late in the night, in the dark recesses of our minds. They're spoken of in stories and superstitions, relics of an unenlightened age, old wives' tales, passed down through generations. Yet no matter how wary and jaded we have become, as individuals or as a society, a part of us remains vulnerable to them: werewolves and wendigos, poltergeists and vampires, angry elves and vengeful spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this beautifully illustrated volume, the host of the hit podcast Lore serves as a guide on a fascinating journey through the history of these terrifying creatures, exploring not only the legends but what they tell us about ourselves. Aaron Mahnke invites us to the desolate Pine Barrens of New Jersey, where the notorious winged, red-eyed Jersey Devil dwells. He delves into harrowing accounts of cannibalism--some officially documented, others the stuff of speculation . . . perhaps. He visits the dimly lit rooms where seances take place, the European villages where gremlins make mischief, even Key West, Florida, home of a haunted doll named Robert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of "emotional vampires" and "zombie malls," the monsters of folklore have become both a part of our language and a part of our collective psyche. Whether these beasts and bogeymen are real or just a reflection of our primal fears, we know, on some level, that not every mystery has been explained and that the unknown still holds the power to strike fear deep in our hearts and souls. As Aaron Mahnke reminds us, sometimes the truth is even scarier than the lore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Lore podcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Truth can often be much scarier than fiction--something Mahnke proves as he dives deep into the world of folklore and the darker side of history in a quest to root out the fragment of truth at the bottom of our fears."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Unlike so much horror that needs over-the-top viscera to scare you, this podcast leans on history--folklore, myth, the stuff people once thought was true--to tell its tales."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Narrated by Mahnke in a style that evokes spooky campfire stories, Lore is a history lesson like no other."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Esquire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling Author, Kristen Proby, comes an all new paranormal romance set in the mystical city of New Orleans… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am never alone. Not even when I am alone. &lt;br /&gt;I see the unquiet dead, the souls that wander through the French Quarter. &lt;br /&gt;They can’t move on, and I can’t stop seeing them. &lt;br /&gt;I wear malachite for protection, and I control what I let in. It’s the only way to stay sane. Everything changes the day Cassian Winslow joins my ghost walking tour and knocks my world off its axis with green eyes the color of the stone around my neck. &lt;br /&gt;An unspeakable evil is loose in New Orleans, taking young women and leaving a bloodbath in his wake. More shadows lurking for me. More unhappy dead. There might be a way to stop it. &lt;br /&gt;Open myself up to Cassian. &lt;br /&gt;If I do, it could spell his death. &lt;br /&gt;But if I don’t, it’s mine. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When Britain intercepted a French ship and its precious cargo–an unhatched dragon’s egg–Capt. Will Laurence of HMS Reliant unexpectedly became master and commander of the noble dragon he named Temeraire. As new recruits in Britain’s Aerial Corps, man and dragon soon proved their mettle in daring combat against Bonaparte’s invading forces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now China has discovered that its rare gift, intended for Napoleon, has fallen into British hands–and an angry Chinese delegation vows to reclaim the remarkable beast. But Laurence refuses to cooperate. Facing the gallows for his defiance, Laurence has no choice but to accompany Temeraire back to the Far East–a long voyage fraught with peril, intrigue, and the untold terrors of the deep. Yet once the pair reaches the court of the Chinese emperor, even more shocking discoveries and darker dangers await.</description>

  <description>Leigh Bardugo's Six of Crows meets Kristin Cashore's Graceling, with a dash of Winter is Coming, in this showstopping debut YA fantasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Early buzz . . . could hardly be louder.” —Entertainment Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age of Darkness approaches.&lt;br /&gt;Five lives stand in its way.&lt;br /&gt;Who will stop it . . . or unleash it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, the Seven Prophets guided humanity. Using their visions of the future, they ended wars and united nations—until the day, one hundred years ago, when the Prophets disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All they left behind is one final, secret prophecy, foretelling an Age of Darkness and the birth of a new Prophet who could be the world’s salvation . . . or the cause of its destruction. As chaos takes hold, five souls are set on a collision course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince exiled from his kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;A ruthless killer known as the Pale Hand.&lt;br /&gt;A once-faithful leader torn between his duty and his heart. &lt;br /&gt;A reckless gambler with the power to find anything or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;And a dying girl on the verge of giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of them—or all of them—could break the world. Will they be savior or destroyer? Perfect for fans of Throne of Glass, Children of Blood and Bone, and An Ember in the Ashes.</description>

  <description>Throughout her illustrious career in letters, Maya Angelou gifted, healed, and inspired the world with her words. Now the beauty and spirit of those words live on in this new and complete collection of poetry that reflects and honors the writer’s remarkable life.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Every poetic phrase, every poignant verse can be found within the pages of this sure-to-be-treasured volume—from her reflections on African American life and hardship in the compilation &lt;i&gt;Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’fore I Diiie &lt;/i&gt;(“Though there’s one thing that I cry for / I believe enough to die for / That is every man’s responsibility to man”) to her revolutionary celebrations of womanhood in the poem “Still I Rise”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(“Out of the huts of history’s shame / I rise / Up from a past that’s rooted in pain / I rise”) to her “On the Pulse of Morning”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;tribute at President William Jefferson Clinton’s inauguration (“Lift up your eyes upon / The day breaking for you. / Give birth again / To the dream.”).&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Maya Angelou: The Complete Poetry&lt;/i&gt; also features her final long-form poems, including “A Brave and Startling Truth,” “Amazing Peace,” “His Day Is Done,” and the honest and endearing &lt;i&gt;Mother:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “I feared if I let you go&lt;br /&gt; You would leave me eternally.&lt;br /&gt; You smiled at my fears, saying&lt;br /&gt; I could not stay in your lap forever”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection also includes the never-before-published poem “Amazement Awaits,” commissioned for the 2008 Olympic Games:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “We are here at the portal of the world we had wished for&lt;br /&gt; At the lintel of the world we most need.&lt;br /&gt; We are here roaring and singing.&lt;br /&gt; We prove that we can not only make peace, we can bring it with us.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Timeless and prescient, this definitive compendium will warm the hearts of Maya Angelou’s most ardent admirers as it introduces new readers to the legendary poet, activist, and teacher—a phenomenal woman for the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WANTED: ROOMMATE. Must be tidy, polite, and absolutely not my brother's hot as sin best friend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I'd had one too many wines. Maybe I'd done it accidentally. Maybe I'd been sleep-texting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I know for sure is this: I absolutely do not want Ethan Hawkins in my apartment, up in my business, taking over my space.&lt;br /&gt;Yet he's here. Moving his stuff into my spare bedroom. Sending a wave of panty-melting, musky man-scent my way every time he walks past me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the thing.&lt;br /&gt;We don't get along--at all. We never have, and I don't think we're going to start now that we're under one roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also that little issue where I'm kinda, sorta, totally in love with him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uh-oh.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>What do a wrong number text, a burning building, and a quirky florist have in common? &lt;br /&gt;A hunky firefighter with an extra-large…hosepipe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I never should have opened that text message. The last thing I needed first thing on a Monday was a picture of some stranger’s, um, eggplant, in my inbox. &lt;br /&gt;I also should have replaced the batteries in my fire alarm, because my Friday night did not need to end with my apartment building going up in flames. &lt;br /&gt;But it’s fine. It’s fine. Everything is fine. &lt;br /&gt;I’m only lying in a hospital bed with more split ends than I’ve ever had, almost all my Earthly possessions have turned to ash, and apparently, they don’t serve wine to patients in this place. &lt;br /&gt;But like I said, it’s fine. &lt;br /&gt;Until he walks in. &lt;br /&gt;The guy who saved my life. My hero. Noah Jacobs. &lt;br /&gt;And the universe is amusing itself at my expense, because the dirty photo I woke up to on Monday? &lt;br /&gt;It’s his.</description>

  <description>Side characters can be heroes too in this charming and fast-paced adventure that is The Land of Stories meets The Phantom Tollbooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indira has been a character-in-waiting her entire life. So she can't believe her luck when she's finally chosen to travel to Fable and study at the renowned Protagonist Preparatory, a school known for producing the best heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Indira's dreams of achieving hero status don't exactly go as planned. A failed audition lands her in the school's side-character track, and her best efforts to prove advisors--famous characters like Alice from Wonderland and Professor Darcy--wrong are constantly sabotaged. Indira is starting to feel like an evil antagonist might be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the danger spreads, Indira discovers all of Fable is under siege. With her friends Maxi and Phoenix by her side, she pieces together clues that will reveal who is behind the dark magic threatening them all. But the more Indira uncovers, the more doubt she feels about her place in this world of stories. After all, can a side character really save the day?</description>

  <description>Aerial combat brings a thrilling new dimension to the Napoleonic Wars as valiant warriors ride mighty fighting dragons, bred for size or speed. When HMS Reliant captures a French frigate and seizes the precious cargo, an unhatched dragon egg, fate sweeps Captain Will Laurence from his seafaring life into an uncertain future – and an unexpected kinship with a most extraordinary creature. Thrust into the rarified world of the Aerial Corps as master of the dragon Temeraire, he will face a crash course in the daring tactics of airborne battle. For as France’s own dragon-borne forces rally to breach British soil in Bonaparte’s boldest gambit, Laurence and Temeraire must soar into their own baptism of fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Three things about Justin Roberts:&lt;br /&gt; 1. He’s a bully.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Our relationship is toxic.&lt;br /&gt; 3. He’s the only one who knows my secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A year ago, I woke in the morgue with a note in my hand telling me that I’m a vampire. I need blood or I’ll start killing people. Lucky for me, Justin has been sneaking into my bedroom and feeding me blood for a year, and the only price I have to pay for it is putting up with his cruel snipes and my unwanted feelings for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just can’t figure out why he keeps coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But all that changes when I’m offered a full-ride scholarship to Justin’s mysterious school, the elite Blackburn Academy, where I might finally learn about vampires. About myself. All I have to do is pass the grueling entrance trials, and the scholarship will be mine. Problem is, Justin doesn’t want me anywhere near his elite school and rich friends. He’s vowed to sabotage me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Justin may have been feeding me blood for a year, but he doesn’t know who he’s up against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But, Blackburn Academy is more than it seems. I’ll be facing more than what Justin Roberts alone can dish out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will competing in the trials be the new beginning I’m hoping for, or will it end my undead existence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published under the title A Bite at the Cherry. This is a full length 80,000 word novel. Recommended for 16+.</description>

  <description>What do you do when you’re the reigning kissing booth champion but the only person you want to kiss is your best friend’s brother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make this clear right here, right now: I, Halley Dawson, do not care that Preston Wright is kissing other women. &lt;br /&gt;Not a lick. Not at all. Nuh-uh-freakin’-uh.&lt;br /&gt;I do care that he’s doing it six feet away from me behind a gaudy velvet curtain—making him my competition in this year’s kissing contest.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I care, you ask? Because I’ve had an unfortunate crush on the insufferable idiot since I was sixteen years old, but I also know it’s never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;He’s the Creek Falls bachelor to die for, and I’m the Creek Falls racoon lady who puts peanut butter sandwiches out for them every night.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going to let him break my four-year-long reign—no matter how many times he breaks the rules and slides the curtain across to do the one thing he’s not allowed to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss me.</description>

  <description>When army officer Chike Ameobi is ordered to kill innocent civilians, he knows it is time to desert his post. As he travels toward Lagos with Yemi, his junior officer, and into the heart of a political scandal involving Nigeria's education minister, Chike becomes the leader of a new platoon, a band of runaways who share his desire for a different kind of life. Among them is Fineboy, a fighter with a rebel group, desperate to pursue his dream of becoming a radio DJ; Isoken, a 16-year-old girl whose father is thought to have been killed by rebels; and the beautiful Oma, escaping a wealthy, abusive husband. Full of humor and heart, Welcome to Lagos is a high-spirited novel about aspirations and escape, innocence and corruption. It offers a provocative portrait of contemporary Nigeria that marks the arrival in the United States of an extraordinary young writer.</description>

  <description>Being crew is walking between two worlds. &lt;br /&gt;One world is normal: Prom. Parties. College. &lt;br /&gt;Those are the concerns they worry about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our world, we deal with other situations. &lt;br /&gt;Cops. Drugs. Brawling. &lt;br /&gt;That’s a typical day for us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if it wasn’t? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if there came a day when you stopped? &lt;br /&gt;When you considered letting your enemies win? &lt;br /&gt;When you didn’t fight back? &lt;br /&gt;When you chose a different path? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I lost my family. Then I got the Wolf Crew. &lt;br /&gt;I couldn't lose them too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when Cross, Zellman, and Jordan keep going…&lt;br /&gt;...and I don’t?</description>

  <description>A speculative thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt;. Optioned by Universal and Elizabeth Banks to be a major motion picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURVIVE THE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sharp prose and gritty realism, &lt;i&gt;The Grace Year&lt;/i&gt; examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.</description>

  <description>This swoonworthy, romantic companion novel to Wendy Higgins's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Sweet Evil series is told from irresistible bad-boy Kaidan's point of view. Readers will love getting inside Kaidan's head, especially fans of the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, the Selection series by Kiera Cass, and &lt;em&gt;Walking Disaster&lt;/em&gt; by Jamie McGuire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When bad-boy drummer Kaidan Rowe encounters good girl Anna Whitt, the girl chosen to vanquish the demons from earth, he can't stop thinking about her. The Nephilim son of the Duke of Lust, Kaidan tries to help Anna embrace a life of sin, but she gradually helps him see that he's meant to do more with his life. Their relationship is as tortured as it is passionate, for Nephilim are forbidden to fall in love. But as hard as they may try to obey, Kai can't seem to stay away from Anna, nor Anna from Kai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of chemistry and high-stakes drama, this companion book is darker, hotter, and completely satisfying.</description>

  <description>Embrace Your fate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evil is running rampant, and sweet Anna Whitt is its target. Nobody knows when or how the Dukes will strike, but Anna and her Nephilim allies will do anything necessary to rid the earth of the demons and their oppressive ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stakes are higher than ever, and Anna is determined that the love she feels will be her strength, not a liability. But trying to protect the ones she loves while running for her life and battling demonic forces proves to be perilous—especially as faces are changing and trust is fleeting. When the Duke of Lust sends Anna's great love, Kaidan Rowe, to work against her, Anna must decide how much she's prepared to risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the most sensual and fast-paced installment yet, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Reckoning&lt;/em&gt; brings all the beloved Neph together one last time to fight for their freedom.</description>

  <description>(Audio Narrated by Erin Mallon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Whitt, the daughter of a guardian angel and a demon, promised herself she’d never do the work of her father—polluting souls. She’d been naive to make such a vow. She’d been naive about a lot of things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by demon whisperers, Anna does whatever she can to survive, even if it means embracing her dark side and earning an unwanted reputation as her school’s party girl. Her life has never looked more bleak. And all the while there’s Kaidan Rowe, son of the Duke of Lust, plaguing her heart and mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unexpected lost message from the angels surfaces, Anna finds herself traveling the globe with Kopano, son of Wrath, in an attempt to gain support of fellow Nephilim and give them hope for the first time. It soon becomes clear that whatever freedoms Anna and the rest of the Neph are hoping to win will not be gained without a fight. Until then, Anna and Kaidan must put aside the issues between them, overcome the steamiest of temptations yet, and face the ultimate question: is loving someone worth risking their life?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it--teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy's sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it's naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way--a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they're alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn't give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she's going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she's built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can't beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson's trademark humor, &lt;em&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/em&gt; explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>Welcome to round two of The Faerie Race—an epic adventure through a realm as compelling as it is deadly…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Faerie Race has proven more gruelling and deadly than Jacqueline thought possible. With one trial down and two to go, it seems the reality show’s producers will stop at nothing to get their ratings—even murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take all of Jacq’s cunning to get through the next trial unscathed, but all she can think about is her discovery that her sister is alive. Too bad her search for answers has only left her with more questions, and more enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to work side-by-side with their beautiful and duplicitous competition, Orin and Jacq are plunged back into a magical world filled with bizarre creatures, far-reaching conspiracies, and not nearly enough to eat. Each challenge brings the two of them closer—but that just means they have more to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Jacq be able to reach the final checkpoint with her heart and her life intact, or will The Elemental Trial prove too daunting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elemental Trial is Book Two in The Faerie Race, a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride through a realm unlike you’ve ever seen.

  <description>Welcome to the final round of The Faerie Race—an epic adventure through a realm as compelling as it is deadly…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final trial of the Faerie Race has arrived: a head-to-head battle through the streets of Elfame city. Jacq and Orin should be ecstatic to have made it this far—but tragedy overshadows them both—leaving the pair wondering if the cost to continue is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the unexpected reappearance of her long-lost sister keeps Jacq in the game, but Cass’s presence comes with troubles of its own. The ancient Brotherhood is closer than ever to carrying out a twisted plot that would mean an end to modern human civilization. There’s one slim chance to foil the Brotherhood’s plans, and only Jacq and Orin have the means to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust into a lethal final showdown that’s more game than race, Jacq and Orin quickly realize that the odds are once again rigged against them. And worse, their enemies have thrust those they love into the cross-hairs. The clock is ticking. Jacq and Orin have one slim chance to foil the Brotherhood’s plans and win the race, or they’ll lose more than just the competition. They’ll lose everything and everyone they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Doomsday Trial is Book Three in The Faerie Race, a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride through a realm unlike you’ve ever seen.

  <description>When eleven-year-old Ollie lost her mother in a plane crash, she sought solace in her books. So when she stumbles upon a distraught woman standing on the banks of the river intent on throwing a book into the water, Ollie stops her, steals the book and rides away on her bike. Upon reading, Ollie discovers a chilling ghost story about a girl, Elizabeth Morrison, who is being chased through cornfields filled with scarecrows by two brothers with deadly intent. When she finds the graves of Elizabeth Morrison and her tormentors, Jonathan and Caleb, on a farm during a school trip, on a day already full of odd occurrences, Ollie starts to think this book is more than just a book. On the ride home, the school bus breaks down along the side of the road and none of the kids or their teacher can get service on their cell phones to call for help. And then Ollie's digital wristwatch starts a mysterious countdown, with the word RUN spelled out on the face. She and two unlikely new friends are the only ones to heed its warning. As night begins to fall, they head out into the woods, bracketed by fearsome scarecrows. The bus driver gives them a word of advice. In order to survive whatever is coming, they'll need to keep to small spaces.</description>

  <description>Harvard graduate student Connie Goodwin needs to spend her summer doing research for her doctoral dissertation. But when her mother asks her to handle the sale of Connie's grandmother's abandoned home near Salem, she can't refuse. As she is drawn deeper into the mysteries of the family house, Connie discovers an ancient key within a seventeenth-century Bible. The key contains a yellowing fragment of parchment with a name written upon it: Deliverance Dane. This discovery launches Connie on a quest-to find out who this woman was and to unearth a rare artifact of singular power: a physick book, its pages a secret repository for lost knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;As the pieces of Deliverance's harrowing story begin to fall into place, Connie is haunted by visions of the long-ago witch trials, and she begins to fear that she is more tied to Salem's dark past than she could have ever imagined.</description>

      <![CDATA[I listened to the audiobook of this after reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41812813.The_Daughters_of_Temperance_Hobbs" title="The Daughters of Temperance Hobbs by Katherine Howe" rel="nofollow">The Daughters of Temperance Hobbs</a>. After fininishing Temperance Hobbs I discovered that there was another book. While you don't need to read this one first, they both stand on their own, I recommend reading this one first as it gives a great back story...</a>]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This page-turning, harrowing debut is the story of a girl trying to fit in, whose obsessive new friends and desperation to belong leads her to places she'd never imagined...dark, dangerous, and possibly even violent. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1998, a sixteen-year-old girl is found dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's posed on a swing on her boarding school's property, dressed all in white, with no known cause of death. Whispers and rumors swirl, with no answers. But there are a few who know what happened; there is one girl who will never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year earlier: a new student, Violet, steps on the campus of Elm Hollow Academy, an all-girl's boarding school on the outskirts of a sleepy coastal town. This is her fresh start, her chance to begin again in the wake of tragedy, leave her demons behind. Bright but a little strange, uncertain and desperate to fit in, she soon finds herself invited to an advanced study group, led by her alluring and mysterious art teacher, Annabel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, with three other girls--Alex, Grace, and Robin--the five of them delve into the school's long-buried grim history: of Greek and Celtic legends; of the school founder's "academic" interest in the occult; of gruesome 17th century witch trials. Annabel does her best to convince the girls that her classes aren't related to ancient rites and rituals, and that they are just history and mythology. But the more she tries to warn the girls off the topic, the more they drawn to it, and the possibility that they can harness magic for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet quickly finds herself wrapped up in this heady new world of lawless power--except she is needled by the disappearance of a former member of the group, one with whom Violet shares an uncanny resemblance. As her friends' actions take a turn for the darker and spiral out of control, she begins to wonder who she can trust, all the while becoming more deeply entangled. How far will these young girls go to protect one another...or to destroy one another?</description>

But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>Caleb Samuels.&lt;br /&gt;Smug. Irritating. Pain in the … &lt;br /&gt;After high school, I was content with the idea of never seeing him again.&lt;br /&gt;But as his sister Merilyn’s best friend, it was bound to happen eventually. I just didn’t expect it to be at her wake, where, following a foolish, naive, and completely ridiculous incident, I’m prepared to return to my perfectly routine life and wash my hands of him forever. Again. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Merilyn had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;Even though she traveled the world, her final request is for Caleb and me to recreate our senior year bucket list and take her ashes along for one last adventure.&lt;br /&gt;All the foolish, naive, and—you guessed it—completely ridiculous memories return in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;He tormented me, teased me, kissed me like no one ever had, made me fall for him, and broke me like no one else ever would.&lt;br /&gt;Reliving it all might end with a crash worse than the first.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe not. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe the fall would never end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*New Adult &lt;br /&gt;*Second Chance&lt;br /&gt;*Best Friend's Brother</description>

  <description>6 hrs 12 mins&lt;br /&gt;Binti has returned to her home planet, believing that the violence of the Meduse has been left behind. Unfortunately, although her people are peaceful on the whole, the same cannot be said for the Khoush, who fan the flames of their ancient rivalry with the Meduse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from her village when the conflicts start, Binti hurries home, but anger and resentment has already claimed the lives of many close to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again it is up to Binti, and her intriguing new friend Mwinyi, to intervene--though the elders of her people do not entirely trust her motives--and try to prevent a war that could wipe out her people, once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In the early 1900s, a young woman embarks on a fantastical journey of self-discovery after finding a mysterious book in this captivating debut.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sprawling mansion filled with peculiar treasures, January Scaller is a curiosity herself. As the ward of the wealthy Mr. Locke, she feels little different from the artifacts that decorate the halls: carefully maintained, largely ignored, and utterly out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she finds a strange book. A book that carries the scent of other worlds, and tells a tale of secret doors, of love, adventure and danger. Each page turn reveals impossible truths about the world and January discovers a story increasingly entwined with her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lush and richly imagined, a tale of impossible journeys, unforgettable love, and the enduring power of stories awaits in Alix E. Harrow’s spellbinding debut—step inside and discover its magic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The epic Chinese classic and phenomenon published in the US for the first time! A fantastical generational saga and kung fu epic, Jin Yong's A Hero Born is a classic, stretching from the Song Empire (China 1200 AD) to the appearance of a warlord whose name will endure for eternity: Genghis Khan. Filled with an extraordinary cast of characters, A Hero Born is a tale of fantasy and wonder, love and passion, treachery and war, betrayal and brotherhood.And then a hero is born...After his father, a Song patriot, was murdered, Guo Jing and his mother fled to the plains and joined Ghengis Khan and his people. Loyal, humble and driven, he learned all he could from the warlord and his army in hopes of one day joining them in their cause. But what Guo Jing doesn't know is that he's destined to battle an opponent that will challenge him in every way imaginable and with a connection to his past that no one envisioned.With the help and guidance of his shifus, The Seven Heroes of the South, Guo Jing returns to China to face his foe and carry out his destiny. But in a land divided by treachery and war, betrayal and ambition, he'll have to put his courage and knowledge to the test to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling authors Sasha Alsberg and Lindsay Cummings deliver the dazzling finale to the acclaimed Androma Saga, where stunning betrayals and devastating secrets send an embattled galaxy spiraling into the ultimate nightmare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her ship is gone, her crew is captured and notorious mercenary Androma Racella is no longer the powerful Bloody Baroness, but a fugitive ruthlessly hunted across the Mirabel Galaxy. The bloodthirsty Queen Nor now rules most of the galaxy through a mind-control toxin and she'll stop at nothing to destroy her most hated adversary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andi will risk anything, even her precious freedom, to find a cure. Stranded with her unlikely ally, Dex, on the unforgiving ice planet of Solera, their plan to infiltrate a black-market city proves dangerously irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Arcardius, Nor's actions have opened Mirabel to invasion. As Andi's crew fights to regain their freedom, Andi and Dex discover a threat far greater than anything they've faced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only by saving their mortal enemy can the crew of the &lt;em&gt;Marauder&lt;/em&gt; make one last desperate strike to save the galaxy--unaware that a shattering, centuries-old secret may demand the most wrenching sacrifice of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Small Great Things&lt;/i&gt; returns with a powerful and provocative new novel about ordinary lives that intersect during a heart-stopping crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Picoult at her fearless best . . . Timely, balanced and certain to inspire debate.”—&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center—a women’s reproductive health services clinic—its staff offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester disguised as a patient, who now stands in the cross hairs of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed individual himself, vowing to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the same place on this fateful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Picoult—one of the most fearless writers of our time—tackles a complicated issue in this gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to be a good parent? &lt;i&gt;A Spark of Light&lt;/i&gt; will inspire debate, conversation . . . and, hopefully, understanding.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the celebrated and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Banker's Wife&lt;/i&gt;, worlds collide when an FBI agent investigates a string of grisly murders on Long Island that raises the impossible question: What happens when the primary suspect is your father?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Agent Nell Flynn hasn't been home in ten years. Nell and her father, Homicide Detective Martin Flynn, have never had much of a relationship. And Suffolk County will always be awash in memories of her mother, Marisol, who was brutally murdered when Nell was just seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Martin Flynn dies in a motorcycle accident, Nell returns to the house she grew up in so that she can spread her father's ashes and close his estate. At the behest of her father's partner, Detective Lee Davis, Nell becomes involved in an investigation into the murders of two young women in Suffolk County. The further Nell digs, the more likely it seems to her that her father should be the prime suspect--and that his friends on the police force are covering his tracks. Plagued by doubts about her mother's murder--and her own role in exonerating her father in that case--Nell can't help but ask questions about who killed Ria Ruiz and Adriana Marques and why. But she may not like the answers she finds--not just about those she loves, but about herself.</description>

  <description>A girl, missing&lt;br /&gt;A woman, searching&lt;br /&gt;A killer, planning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Agent Elsa Myers finds missing people.&lt;br /&gt;She knows how it feels to be lost...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though her father lies dying in a hospital north of New York City, Elsa cannot refuse a call for help. A teenage girl has gone missing from Forest Hills, Queens, and during the critical first hours of the case, a series of false leads hides the fact that she did not go willingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each passing hour, as the hunt for Ruby deepens into a search for a man who may have been killing for years, the case starts to get underneath Elsa's skin. Everything she has buried - her fraught relationship with her sister and niece, her self-destructive past, her mother's death - threatens to resurface, with devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save the missing girl, she may have to lose herself...and return to the darkness she's been hiding from for years.</description>

  <description>I asked for his criteria for bed buddies-that's the PG version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He swore at me and said he didn't do groupies. And just like that, our friendship was off to a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reese Forster was the starting point guard for the Seattle Thunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous. Cocky. Loved by the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's also attending preseason basketball training camp where I used to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correction: where I work again, because I was fired from my last job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And dumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I might have a tiny bit of baggage, but that's normal. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reese and I shouldn't have become friends. We shouldn't have become roommates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we really shouldn't have started sleeping together ... (Except we did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm adorably psychotic. He's in the NBA.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a disaster waiting to happen, at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two brothers meet at the border of their vast cattle properties under the unrelenting sun of outback Queensland, in this stunning new standalone novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Jane Harper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are at the stockman’s grave, a landmark so old, no one can remember who is buried there. But today, the scant shadow it casts was the last hope for their middle brother, Cameron. The Bright family’s quiet existence is thrown into grief and anguish. Something had been troubling Cameron. Did he lose hope and walk to his death? Because if he didn’t, the isolation of the outback leaves few suspects…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, suspenseful, and deeply atmospheric, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Man&lt;/i&gt; is the highly anticipated next book from the bestselling and award-winning Jane Harper, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this psychological thriller, Alex North weaves a multi-generational tale of suspense, as a father and son are caught in the crosshairs of an investigation to catch a serial killer preying on a small town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his wife, Tom Kennedy believes a fresh start will help him and his young son Jake heal. A new beginning, a new house, a new town. Featherbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed "The Whisper Man," for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic and living off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: &lt;i&gt;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&lt;/i&gt; His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible union—holy matrimony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse than fire. Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love makes fools of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780062878021.

  <description>You may win $1,000,000. You will judge a man of murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eccentric scientist tells you he can read your mind and offers to prove it in a high-stakes wager. A respected college professor exacts impassioned, heat-of-the-moment revenge on his wife’s killer—a week after her death—and you’re on the jury. Take a Turing test with a twist, discover how your future choices might influence the past, and try your luck at Three Card Monte. And while you weigh chance, superstition, destiny, intuition and logic in making your decisions, ask yourself: are you responsible for your actions at all? Choose wisely—if you can.</description>

  <description>Her ship is gone, her crew is captured and notorious mercenary Androma Racella is no longer the powerful Bloody Baroness, but a fugitive ruthlessly hunted across the Mirabel Galaxy. The bloodthirsty Queen Nor now rules most of the galaxy through a mind-control toxin and she’ll stop at nothing to destroy her most hated adversary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andi will risk anything, even her precious freedom, to find a cure. Stranded with her unlikely ally, Dex, on the unforgiving ice planet of Solera, their plan to infiltrate a black-market city proves dangerously irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Arcardius, Nor’s actions have opened Mirabel to invasion. As Andi’s crew fights to regain their freedom, Andi and Dex discover a threat far greater than anything they’ve faced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only by saving their mortal enemy can the crew of the &lt;i&gt;Marauder&lt;/i&gt; make one last desperate strike to save the galaxy—unaware that a shattering, centuries-old secret may demand the most wrenching sacrifice of all.</description>

  <description>While she seems to have it all, Sophie Knight is looking for more. When gorgeous and carefree Michael Frisk walks into her life, he offers the excitement and passion she desires.&lt;br /&gt;Sophie is willing to risk everything she has. After all, she is used to concealing things from her husband—like her alcoholism, her unhappiness. But soon she has more to hide. She wakes up one morning in an alcoholic haze and finds bruises on her body, but has no recollection of what happened to her. Was she raped?&lt;br /&gt;When unsettling notes and mysterious phone calls start, Sophie wonders whom she should turn to. Is Michael the cause of the frightening things happening in her life, or is he the answer to her problems?</description>

  <description>A dead man—nameless, all but formless, not quite here but unable to move on—fights his way back to who he was. What happened to him? And what happened to the love of his life? His memories retreat like the tide, tantalizingly close but always receding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anonymous ghost is harassed in the right direction by a fellow spirit, one of the few who remain—a circus fortune teller tethered to him by a tragic history of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A haunting novel of the supernatural, The Hanged Man and the Fortune Teller is a testament to the longing that comes over us in our lonely moments, when we shiver and feel the presence of someone near us in the dark.</description>

  <description>In 1936, tucked deep into the woods of Troublesome Creek, KY, lives blue-skinned 19-year-old Cussy Carter, the last living female of the rare Blue People ancestry. The lonely young Appalachian woman joins the historical Pack Horse Library Project of Kentucky and becomes a librarian, riding across slippery creek beds and up treacherous mountains on her faithful mule to deliver books and other reading material to the impoverished hill people of Eastern Kentucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along her dangerous route, Cussy, known to the mountain folk as Bluet, confronts those suspicious of her damselfly-blue skin and the government's new book program. She befriends hardscrabble and complex fellow Kentuckians, and is fiercely determined to bring comfort and joy, instill literacy, and give to those who have nothing, a bookly respite, a fleeting retreat to faraway lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek&lt;i&gt; is a powerful message about how the written word affects people--a story of hope and heartbreak, raw courage and strength splintered with poverty and oppression, and one woman's chances beyond the darkly hollows. Inspired by the true and historical blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service, &lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek showcases a bold and unique tale of the Pack horse Librarians in literary novels — a story of fierce strength and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere — even back home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dexter meets Mr. and Mrs. Smith in this wildly compulsive debut thriller about a couple whose fifteen-year marriage has finally gotten too interesting...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our love story is simple. I met a gorgeous woman. We fell in love. We had kids. We moved to the suburbs. We told each other our biggest dreams, and our darkest secrets. And then we got bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look like a normal couple. We're your neighbors, the parents of your kid's friend, the acquaintances you keep meaning to get dinner with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have secrets to keeping a marriage alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours just happens to be getting away with murder.</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy little English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code; little chalk stick figures they leave for each other as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing will ever be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out his other friends got the same messages, they think it could be a prank... until one of them turns up dead. That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expertly alternating between flashbacks and the present day, The Chalk Man is the very best kind of suspense novel, one where every character is wonderfully fleshed out and compelling, where every mystery has a satisfying payoff, and where the twists will shock even the savviest reader.</description>

  <description>Part One: "Darien" - JC De La Torre, author of the critically acclaimed novel Ancient Rising, gives us a new fusion of Science Fiction and Magic in Star Mage. In issue one, Darien Connors discovers he's not from Earth, has strange magical powers and is the key in an ancient war between two alien races of necromancers. Like Harry Potter meets the Last Starfighter, Star Mage offers wizard battles with a side of spaceship warfare, alien worlds and weird creatures.</description>

  <description>One day, gravity on Earth suddenly became a fraction of what it is now. Twenty years later, humanity has adapted to its new low-gravity reality. And to Willa Fowler, a woman born just after G-day, it's...well, it's pretty awesome, actually. You can fly through the air! I mean, sure, you can also die if you jump too high. So you just don't jump too high. And maybe don't get mixed up in your Dad's secret plan to bring gravity back that could get you killed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKYWARD, VOL. 1 collects issues #1-5 of the ongoing series from writer Joe Henderson (showrunner of Fox's Lucifer) and artist Lee Garbett (Lucifer, Loki: Agent of Asgard).&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1974. Untamed. Unpredictable. A story of a family in crisis struggling to survive at the edge of the world, it is also a story of young and enduring love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora Allbright and her husband Ernt, a recently-returned Vietnam veteran scarred by the war, uproot their thirteen-year-old daughter Leni to start a new life in Alaska. Utterly unprepared for the weather and the isolation, but welcomed by the close-knit community, they fight to build a home in this harsh, beautiful wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once an epic story of human survival and love, and an intimate portrait of a family tested beyond endurance, The Great Alone offers a glimpse into a vanishing way of life in America. With her trademark combination of elegant prose and deeply drawn characters, Kristin Hannah has delivered an enormously powerful story that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the remarkable and enduring strength of women. About the highest stakes a family can face and the bonds that can tear a community apart, this is a novel as spectacular and powerful as Alaska itself. It is the finest example of Kristin Hannah's ability to weave together the deeply personal with the universal.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>Originally written in the mid-1950s, &lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; was the novel Harper Lee first submitted to her publishers before &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;. Assumed to have been lost, the manuscript was discovered in late 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; features many of the characters from &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; some twenty years later. Returning home to Maycomb to visit her father, Jean Louise Finch—Scout—struggles with issues both personal and political, involving Atticus, society, and the small Alabama town that shaped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring how the characters from &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; are adjusting to the turbulent events transforming mid-1950s America, &lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; casts a fascinating new light on Harper Lee’s enduring classic. Moving, funny and compelling, it stands as a magnificent novel in its own right.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanted: one hot guy with rock-hard abs and a big stick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broke and desperate, Sugar Ryan has no use for arrogant, bad boy athletes . . . until she’s forced to bargain with the cockiest of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he knew she was alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mission? Get on this hockey player’s radar any way possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack Morgan is the king of the ice and the bedroom—but nothing prepares him for the mystery girl who shows up everywhere he does—frat parties, his favorite bar, and finally his front door with an offer he can’t refuse. The only rule in her boyfriend bargain: &lt;b&gt;no falling in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one (um, two) smoking-hot hookups, he’s done with pretending and vows to make their fake relationship real. Too bad she can’t trust a player with a reputation for breaking hearts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this hockey star score his forever girl or will their Boyfriend Bargain end in heartbreak? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A standalone hockey romance.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking beneath Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery. But time is running out, and the spirit is only growing stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Cass fails, the force she's unleashed could haunt the city forever.</description>

  <description>It’s not your typical family vacation when Olive, and her adopted siblings Darwin and Charlotte find themselves falling into other worlds as they explore Grandma Lupé’s strange hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPEN THE DOOR. ADVENTURE AWAITS. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Olive and her adopted siblings Charlotte and Darwin are spending the summer with their estranged grandma at her creepy hotel and it’s all work and no play. They’re stuck inside doing boring chores but they soon stumble upon an incredible secret... Behind each room door of the hotel lies a portal to a different strange and mysterious place. The simple turn of a knob transports them to a distant magical world filled with space pirates. Behind the next door are bearded wizards. Down the hall is a doorway to a cotton-candied kingdom. But once the doors are opened, worlds start colliding, and only one family can save them before they tear themselves apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written by Terry Blas (The Amazing World of Gumball) and illustrated by the talented Claudia Aguirre (Kim &amp;amp; Kim), this world-hopping fantasy tale breaks down the door to imagination and dares you to embrace the idea that family is everything. </description>

  <description>A young adult, fantasy novel about a teenager who is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory. There will never be another child; every baby born after her has been taken away. Everyone wonders why she survived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Whisperer was born in 2080, in the small futuristic world of Craigluy. President Esther, in charge for the last twenty-two years, has divided their world into three territories, separated by classes—the rich, the working class, and the poor—because she believes the poor should not mingle with the others. And, the poor are no longer allowed to have children, since they do not have the means to take care of them. &lt;br /&gt;Any babies born, accidentally or willfully, are killed. Emma is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory; every baby born after her has died. Somehow, she survived this fate. &lt;br /&gt;During the president’s Monday night speech, she announces a party will be held to honor the last child in the territory, Emma Whisperer. Emma must read a speech, expressing how happy she is to be the last eighteen-year-old. &lt;br /&gt;Emma doesn’t like the rules; she doesn’t believe in them. So, she feels she must rebel against them. Her family doesn’t agree with her rebellion, since they are hiding a big secret. If this secret gets out, it will be disastrous, and deadly, for her family. &lt;br /&gt;During Emma’s journey, she meets—and becomes friends with—Eric. He is one of the guards for the president. She also befriends Samuel, another guard for the president, who is summoned to watch over her. As Emma meets new people, she doesn’t know who she can trust. Yet, she finds herself falling for a guy, something which has never happened before. &lt;br /&gt;After doing what she feels is right, Emma finds herself in imminent danger. In the end, she must make one gut-wrenching decision, a decision that may be disastrous for them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fans of dystopian fantasy will devour this book. L. J. Epps writes a story that, while dealing with heavy subject matter, is still a light, enjoyable read. This dystopian fantasy novel ignites the imagination, and is a must read for fans of The Hunger Games and the Divergent Trilogy.”&lt;br /&gt;—Kristina Gemmell,&lt;br /&gt;Beta Reader</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a decent start to a trilogy. It has quite a few of the typical YA dystopian tropes. The main character sticks up for what she believes in and finds herself learning that there is more to the oppressive government that she lives in than she knows. The story follows Emma Whisperer, the last...]]>

  <description>Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad, was originally a three-part series in Blackwood's Magazine in 1899. It is a story within a story, following a character named Charlie Marlow, who recounts his adventure to a group of men onboard an anchored ship. The story told is of his early life as a ferry boat captain. Although his job was to transport ivory downriver, Charlie develops an interest in investing an ivory procurement agent, Kurtz, who is employed by the government. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in “one of the darkest places on earth.” Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, &lt;i&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; is considered one of the most influential works ever written.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a strange little novella. It packs a punch in such a short little book. I really enjoy Nuevel's writing and his imaginative plotlines. If you are expecting giant robots and aliens you won't find them here. This is more speculative/realistic fiction set in the future. I can actually see t...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A novel about a young woman determined to make her way in the wilds of North Carolina, and the two men that will break her isolation open.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. She's barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kya is not what they say. Abandoned at age ten, she has survived on her own in the marsh that she calls home. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life lessons from the land, learning from the false signals of fireflies the real way of this world. But while she could have lived in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world--until the unthinkable happens.</description>

  <description>On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; reporter and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt;, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.</description>

  <description>Local metalsmith and gift shop owner, Dahlia McGuire, likes her quiet life in Hartwell, Delaware. It’s the perfect place to hide from her family and the tragic events that led to their estrangement. However, when her father, the person she loves most in the world, needs her Dahlia has no choice but to return to Boston to face her ghosts. One of those happens to be her ex-boyfriend’s best friend, Michael Sullivan. The man she was never supposed to fall in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Sullivan has never forgotten Dahlia McGuire. Some might say he’s never gotten over her. For years he lived with the anger of her desertion, and now, newly-divorced, he’s finally ready to move on. That proves impossible when Dahlia returns to Boston and reawakens their explosive connection.

When she flees home to Hartwell, Michael follows, determined to do everything in his power to convince her they belong together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the unthinkable hits the quiet seaside town, Michael finds himself trying to unravel more than the mystery of Dahlia’s broken heart. It’s time for truths left unsaid to finally be spoken or Michael and Dahlia might find themselves torn apart forever…</description>

All she knows is that her abilities have been a plague upon her life since she was a child. After years of suffering at the hands of a megalomaniac, Thea escaped and has been on the run ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leadership and protection of his pack are of the utmost importance to Conall MacLennan, Alpha and Chief of Clan MacLennan, the last werewolf pack in Scotland. Which is why watching his sister slowly die of a lycanthropic disease is emotional torture. When Conall is approached by a businessman who offers a cure for his sister in exchange for the use of Conall’s rare tracking ability, Conall forges an unbreakable contract with him. He has to find and retrieve the key to the cure: dangerous murderer, Thea Quinn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea’s attempts to evade the ruthless werewolf are not only thwarted by the Alpha, but by outside dangers. With no choice but to rely on one another for survival, truths are revealed, intensifying a passionate connection they both fight to resist. At war with themselves and each other, Conall and Thea’s journey to Scotland forces them to face a heartrending choice between love and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;War of Hearts&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone paranormal romance.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite character Kenji Kishimoto narrates t&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;his gripping companion novella to Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Shatter Me series, set during the explosive events in &lt;em&gt;Restore Me&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ending of &lt;em&gt;Restore Me &lt;/em&gt;left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until &lt;em&gt;Defy Me&lt;/em&gt;, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series, hits shelves in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Avi Steinberg is stumped. After defecting from yeshiva to Harvard, he has only a senior thesis essay on Bugs Bunny to show for his effort. While his friends and classmates advance in the world, he remains stuck at a crossroads, unable to meet the lofty expectations of his Orthodox Jewish upbringing. And his romantic existence as a freelance obituary writer just isn’t cutting it. Seeking direction—and dental insurance—Steinberg takes a job as a librarian in a tough Boston prison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The prison library counter, his new post, attracts con men, minor prophets, ghosts, and an assortment of quirky regulars searching for the perfect book and a connection to the outside world. There’s an anxious pimp who solicits Steinberg’s help in writing a memoir. A passionate gangster who dreams of hosting a cooking show titled &lt;i&gt;Thug Sizzle&lt;/i&gt;. A disgruntled officer who instigates a major feud over a Post-it note. A doomed ex-stripper who asks Steinberg to orchestrate a reunion with her estranged son, himself an inmate. Over time, Steinberg is drawn into the accidental community of outcasts that has formed among his bookshelves — a drama he recounts with heartbreak and humor. But when the struggles of the prison library — between life and death, love and loyalty — become personal, Steinberg is forced to take sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Running the Books&lt;/i&gt; is a trenchant exploration of prison culture and an entertaining tale of one young man’s earnest attempt to find his place in the world while trying not to get fired in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Last Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone enemies to lovers romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonah Kingston is the last wingman standing.&lt;br /&gt;June Moxee doesn't care if he's the last man on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't exactly avoided relationships, but love has never been a priority. Solitude doesn't bother me and being alone doesn't mean being lonely. Until she moved to the island and I had to reconsider everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June seems content running her yarn shop, knitting with the local church ladies, and avoiding me. She's a temptress in a hand-knit sweater. And for some reason, she's not a fan of mine. It might be the tattoos. Or the beard. Or the fact that we're polar opposites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman has finally caught my attention. Too bad she thinks she hates me. Good thing I'm stubborn enough to try to change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone, small town rom com in the &lt;i&gt;Wingmen&lt;/i&gt; series. You do not have to read the previous books first to enjoy this book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book ends at 91%. There are two bonus chapters included from previous&lt;/i&gt; Wingmen &lt;i&gt;books.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Evelyn Dasher crossed paths with Luc, she was thrown headfirst into the world of the Lux—only to discover that she was already far more involved in their world than she ever suspected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Luxen aren’t the only ones with a hidden past. There’s a gap in Evie’s memory, lost months of her life and a lingering sense that something happened, something she can’t remember and nobody is willing to tell her. She needs to find out the truth about who she is—and who she was. But every answer she finds only brings up more questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her search for the truth brings her ever closer to Luc, the Origin at the center of it all. He’s powerful, arrogant, inhumanly beautiful, extremely dangerous…and possibly in love with her. But even as Evie falls for him, she can’t help but wonder if his attraction is to her, or to the memory of a girl who no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the while, a new threat looms: reports of a flu-like, fatal virus that the government insists is being spread by Luxen. A horrifying illness that changes whoever it touches, spreading panic across a country already at its breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times, USA Today, &lt;/i&gt;and internationally bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout returns to the world of the Lux with this steamy, shocking second installment of the Origin series that will leave readers reeling.</description>

  <description>14 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following their adventures in The Bear and the Nightingale and The Girl in the Tower, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the best-selling Winternight Trilogy, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A tale both intimate and epic, featuring a heroine whose harrowing and wondrous journey culminates in an emotionally resonant finale.” (Publishers Weekly, starred review) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers called Katherine Arden’s novels The Bear and the Nightingale and The Girl in the Tower “lyrical”, “emotionally stirring”, and “utterly bewitching”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Winternight Trilogy introduced an unforgettable heroine, Vasilisa Petrovna, a girl determined to forge her own path in a world that would rather lock her away. Her gifts and her courage have drawn the attention of Morozko, the winter-king, but it is too soon to know if this connection will prove a blessing or a curse. Now, Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers - and for someone to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The grand prince is in a rage, choosing allies who will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance praise for Winter of the Witch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Katherine Arden’s Winternight Trilogy isn’t just good - it’s hug-to-your-chest, straight-to-the-favorites-shelf, reread-immediately good, and each book just gets better. The Winter of the Witch plunges us back to fourteenth-century Moscow, where old gods and new vie for the soul of Russia and fate rests on a witch girl’s slender shoulders. Prepare to have your heart ripped out, loaned back to you full of snow and magic, and ripped out some more.” (Laini Taylor) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Luxuriously detailed yet briskly suspenseful.... A striking literary fantasy informed by Arden’s deep knowledge.” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Visceral descriptions of battle, an atmospheric sense of place, and some truly heartbreaking moments of loss make this a gut-wrenching read, but there’s ample hope and satisfaction to be found as Vasya chooses her own unique path to triumph.” (Booklist)</description>

  <description>13 Hours and 3 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A remarkable young woman blazes her own trail, from the backwoods of Russia to the court of Moscow, in the exhilarating sequel to Katherine Arden’s bestselling debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Arden’s enchanting first novel introduced readers to an irresistible heroine. Vasilisa has grown up at the edge of a Russian wilderness, where snowdrifts reach the eaves of her family’s wooden house and there is truth in the fairy tales told around the fire. Vasilisa’s gift for seeing what others do not won her the attention of Morozko—Frost, the winter demon from the stories—and together they saved her people from destruction. But Frost’s aid comes at a cost, and her people have condemned her as a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Vasilisa faces an impossible choice. Driven from her home by frightened villagers, the only options left for her are marriage or the convent. She cannot bring herself to accept either fate and instead chooses adventure, dressing herself as a boy and setting off astride her magnificent stallion Solovey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after Vasilisa prevails in a skirmish with bandits, everything changes. The Grand Prince of Moscow anoints her a hero for her exploits, and she is reunited with her beloved sister and brother, who are now part of the Grand Prince’s inner circle. She dares not reveal to the court that she is a girl, for if her deception were discovered it would have terrible consequences for herself and her family. Before she can untangle herself from Moscow’s intrigues—and as Frost provides counsel that may or may not be trustworthy—she will also confront an even graver threat lying in wait for all of Moscow itself.</description>

  <description>There were always whispers about my roommate at Hillcrest Academy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wealthiest of the wealthy sent their kids to our boarding school, and Brooke Bennett had been at the top, though I never quite knew why. She was fun and outgoing, but she kept quiet about her family. The only things she showed me were photographs of her brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became fascinated with her second-oldest brother. Kai Bennett. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was the most of them all. Smoldering. Hypnotic. Alluring. &lt;br /&gt;Kai had eyes that pulled me in and a face that haunted my dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He came to our school with their father, and that’s when I learned what kind of family Brooke came from. They were mafia, and Brooke’s oldest brother was dead. Her father said accident, but Brooke said murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later, her father died, and Kai became the head of the Bennett Family. Brooke left Hillcrest for good, and that was the last time I saw her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years later, I’m staring at her face on the television. Brooke is missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, Kai Bennett kidnaps me.</description>

  <description>A collection of the most well-known and treasured writings and speeches of Dr. King, available for the first time as an ebook &lt;br /&gt;"The Essential Martin Luther King, Jr." is the ultimate collection of Dr. King's most inspirational and transformative speeches and sermons, accessibly available for the first time as an ebook. Here, in Dr. King's own words, are writings that reveal an intellectual struggle and growth as fierce and alive as any chronicle of his political life could possibly be. Included amongst the twenty selections are Dr. King's most influential and persuasive works such as "I Have a Dream" and "Letter from Birmingham Jail" but also the essay "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence," and his last sermon "I See the Promised Land," preached the day before he was assassinated. &lt;br /&gt;Published in honor of the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, "The Essential Martin Luther King, Jr." includes twenty selections that celebrate the life's work of our most visionary thinkers. Collectively, they bring us Dr. King in many roles--philosopher, theologian, orator, essayist, and author--and further cement the most powerful and enduring words of a man who touched the conscience of the nation and world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catching a killer is dangerous. And could be fatal if the best bait . . .&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the hugely talented author of &lt;em&gt;The Kind Worth Killing&lt;/em&gt; comes an exquisitely chilling tale of a young suburban wife with a history of psychological instability whose fears about her new neighbor could lead them both to murder . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hen and her husband Lloyd have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby, and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she’s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder—an obsession she doesn’t talk about anymore, but can’t fully shake either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could her neighbor, Matthew, be a killer? Or is this the beginning of another psychotic episode like the one she suffered back in college, when she became so consumed with proving a fellow student guilty that she ended up hurting a classmate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more Hen observes Matthew, the more she suspects he’s planning something truly terrifying. Yet no one will believe her. Then one night, when she comes face to face with Matthew in a dark parking lot, she realizes that he knows she’s been watching him, that she’s really on to him. And that this is the beginning of a horrifying nightmare she may not live to escape. . .</description>

  <description>The highly anticipated sequel to The Queen’s Rising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Brienna is a mistress of knowledge and is settling into her role as the daughter of Davin MacQuinn, a disgraced lord who returned to Maevana to reclaim his house. Though she’d just survived a revolution, one that will finally return a queen to the throne, she faces another difficult challenge. She must prove herself trustworthy to the MacQuinns. But as Queen Isolde Kavanagh’s closest confidant, she’ll have to balance serving her father’s house as well as her country. And then there’s Cartier, a wholly separate but desirable factor in her new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aodhan Morgane, formerly known as Cartier Évariste, is adjusting to the stark contrast between his pre-rebellion life in Valenia as a master of knowledge and his current one as the lord of a fallen house. During his castle’s restoration, he discovers a ten-year-old boy named Tomas, whose past and parentage are a complete mystery. So when Cartier’s former pupil Brienna is as taken with Tomas as he is, he lets his mind wander—what if he doesn’t have to raise him or his house alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Lannon trial rapidly approaches, Brienna and Cartier must put their feelings aside to concentrate on forging alliances, executing justice, and ensuring that no one interferes with the queen’s coronation. But resistance is rumbling among the old regime’s supporters, who are desperate to find a weakness in the rebels’ forces. And nothing makes a person more vulnerable than deep-seated love.</description>

  <description>Can you love someone to death? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some would say Becky Gerard is a devoted mother and would do anything for her only child. Others claim she's obsessed and can't stop the vicious circle of finding a cure at her daughter's expense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old Meghan has been in and out of hospitals with a plague of unexplained illnesses. But when the ailments take a sharp turn, doctors intervene and immediately suspect Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare behavioral disorder where the primary caretaker, typically the mother, seeks medical help for made-up symptoms of a child. Is this what's going on? Or is there something even more sinister at hand?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unforgettable love story, a novel about past mistakes and betrayals that ripple throughout generations, &lt;i&gt;The Guest Book &lt;/i&gt;examines not just a privileged American family, but a privileged America. It is a literary triumph.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guest Book&lt;/i&gt; follows three generations of a powerful American family, a family that “used to run the world”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the novel begins in 1935, they still do. Kitty and Ogden Milton appear to have everything—perfect children, good looks, a love everyone envies. But after a tragedy befalls them, Ogden tries to bring Kitty back to life by purchasing an island in Maine. That island, and its house, come to define and burnish the Milton family, year after year after year. And it is there that Kitty issues a refusal that will haunt her till the day she dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1959 a young Jewish man, Len Levy, will get a job in Ogden’s bank and earn the admiration of Ogden and one of his daughters, but the scorn of everyone else. Len’s best friend Reg Pauling has always been the only black man in the room—at Harvard, at work, and finally at the Miltons’ island in Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An island that, at the dawn of the 21st century, this last generation doesn’t have the money to keep. When Kitty’s granddaughter hears that she and her cousins might be forced to sell it, and when her husband brings back disturbing evidence about her grandfather’s past, she realizes she is on the verge of finally understanding the silences that seemed to hover just below the surface of her family all her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ambitious novel that weaves the American past with its present, &lt;i&gt;The Guest Book&lt;/i&gt; looks at the racism and power that has been systemically embedded in the US for generations. Brimming with gorgeous writing and bitterly accurate social criticism, it is a literary tour de force.</description>

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heros will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katherine Howe returns to the world of &lt;i&gt;The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane&lt;/i&gt; with a bewitching story of a New England history professor who must race against time to free her family from a curse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connie Goodwin is an expert on America’s fractured past with witchcraft. A young, tenure-track professor in Boston, she’s earned career success by studying the history of magic in colonial America—especially women’s home recipes and medicines—and by exposing society's threats against women fluent in those skills. But beyond her studies, Connie harbors a secret: She is the direct descendant of a woman tried as a witch in Salem, an ancestor whose abilities were far more magical than the historical record shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a hint from her mother and clues from her research lead Connie to the shocking realization that her partner’s life is in danger, she must race to solve the mystery behind a hundreds’-years-long deadly curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flashing back through American history to the lives of certain supernaturally gifted women, &lt;i&gt;The Daughters of Temperance Hobbs&lt;/i&gt; affectingly reveals not only the special bond that unites one particular matriarchal line, but also explores the many challenges to women’s survival across the decades—and the risks some women are forced to take to protect what they love most.</description>

  <description>Satoru is making great strides toward recovery, despite the gaping hole in his memory. But after a chance encounter with a stranger named Airi, Satoru realized the fragments of "dreams" from when he was asleep must be memories from another timeline-and Airi, from a future that no longer exists. As Satoru begins to piece together the events leading up to the incident, he finds himself once again in the thick of the investigation that cost him so much fifteen years ago. Every step closer to the truth is one step closer to a dangerous killer, who is himself eager for another confrontation. Can Satoru put an end to the slippery serial murderer before he strikes again?</description>

  <description>Foster Stewart knows she's different. Her life has never been "normal." Talking to plants and controlling cloud formations aren't things most seventeen year olds are into. Tate "Nighthawk" Taylor is perfect. Star quarterback and all around dreamy boy next door he never thought about his "extra" abilities. What quarterback wouldn't want night vision? That's not weird, right? It's cool! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the night of their first meeting a deadly tornado brings them together and awakens their true abilities - the power to control the element air. Unbeknown to Tate and Foster, they are the first in a group of teens that were genetically manipulated before birth to bond with the elements. Which truly sucks for Foster, as she has to face the fact that Dr. Rick Stewart, her beloved scientist father, betrayed her and now wants to use her and the others for his own nefarious world domination plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foster and Tate must stop Dr. Stewart and his minions before he destroys their lives and the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;World War Z&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Martian&lt;/i&gt; in the explosive follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/i&gt; (“One of the most promising series kickoffs in recent memory”—NPR) and &lt;i&gt;Waking Gods&lt;/i&gt; (“Pure, unadulterated literary escapism”—&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her childhood, Rose Franklin accidentally discovered a giant metal hand buried beneath the ground outside Deadwood, South Dakota. As an adult, Dr. Rose Franklin led the team that uncovered the rest of the body parts which together form Themis: a powerful robot of mysterious alien origin. She, along with linguist Vincent, pilot Kara, and the unnamed Interviewer, protected the Earth from geopolitical conflict and alien invasion alike. Now, after nearly ten years on another world, Rose returns to find her old alliances forfeit and the planet in shambles. And she must pick up the pieces of the Earth Defense Corps as her own friends turn against each other.&lt;br /&gt;8 hrs 46 min</description>

  <description>In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a &lt;i&gt;Tätowierer&lt;/i&gt; (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, &lt;i&gt;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt; is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.</description>

  <description>In the early years of the 20th century, a group of female factory workers in Newark, New Jersey slowly died of radiation poisoning. Around the same time, an Indian elephant was deliberately put to death by electricity in Coney Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these two tragedies are intertwined in a dark alternate history of rage, radioactivity, and injustice crying out to be righted. Prepare yourself for a wrenching journey that crosses eras, chronicling histories of cruelty both grand and petty in search of meaning and justice.</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>Bernadette Fox has vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her daughter Bee claims a family trip to Antarctica as a reward for perfect grades, Bernadette, a fiercely intelligent shut-in, throws herself into preparations for the trip. But worn down by years of trying to live the Seattle life she never wanted, Ms. Fox is on the brink of a meltdown. And after a school fundraiser goes disastrously awry at her hands, she disappears, leaving her family to pick up the pieces--which is exactly what Bee does, weaving together an elaborate web of emails, invoices, and school memos that reveals a secret past Bernadette has been hiding for decades. &lt;i&gt;Where'd You Go Bernadette&lt;/i&gt; is an ingenious and unabashedly entertaining novel about a family coming to terms with who they are and the power of a daughter's love for her mother.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this as an audio book. Both narrators did an excellent job distinguishing all of the characters and giving them similar but unique accents so you could tell them apart. I read a couple of reviews that the pacing might be a little off and I recommend the audiobook as I felt the pa...]]>

  <description>Her name is Binti, and she is the first of the Himba people ever to be offered a place at Oomza University, the finest institution of higher learning in the galaxy. But to accept the offer will mean giving up her place in her family to travel between the stars among strangers who do not share her ways or respect her customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowledge comes at a cost, one that Binti is willing to pay, but her journey will not be easy. The world she seeks to enter has long warred with the Meduse, an alien race that has become the stuff of nightmares. Oomza University has wronged the Meduse, and Binti's stellar travel will bring her within their deadly reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Binti hopes to survive the legacy of a war not of her making, she will need both the gifts of her people and the wisdom enshrined within the University, itself - but first she has to make it there, alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 online resource (1 sound file (02 hr., 30 min., 17 sec.)) : digital</description>

  <description>In this ferocious and tender debut, Chen Chen investigates inherited forms of love and family—the strained relationship between a mother and son, the cost of necessary goodbyes—all from Asian American, immigrant, and queer perspectives. Holding all accountable, this collection fully embraces the loss, grief, and abundant joy that come with charting one’s own path in identity, life, and love.</description>

  <description>Gwen has a destiny to fulfill, but no one will tell her what it is. She’s only recently learned that she is the Ruby, the final member of the time-traveling Circle of Twelve, and since then nothing has been going right. She suspects the founder of the Circle, Count Saint-German, is up to something nefarious, but nobody will believe her. And she’s just learned that her charming time-traveling partner, Gideon, has probably been using her all along. Emerald Green is the stunning conclusion to Kerstin Gier's Ruby Red Trilogy, picking up where Sapphire Blue left off, reaching new heights of intrigue and romance as Gwen finally uncovers the secrets of the time-traveling society and learns her fate.</description>

She is unsure of herself at every step, some of that is warranted, while most of it is not. You aren't sure if you like Gideon or not because he's pretty much been a jerk...]]>

  <description>Gwen's life has been a rollercoaster since she discovered she was the Ruby, the final member of the secret time-traveling Circle of Twelve. In between searching through history for the other time-travelers and asking for a bit of their blood (gross!), she's been trying to figure out what all the mysteries and prophecies surrounding the Circle really mean. At least Gwen has plenty of help. Her best friend Lesley follows every lead diligently on the Internet. James the ghost teaches Gwen how to fit in at an eighteenth century party. And Xemerius, the gargoyle demon who has been following Gwen since he caught her kissing Gideon in a church, offers advice on everything. Oh, yes. And of course there is Gideon, the Diamond. One minute he's very warm indeed; the next he's freezing cold. Gwen's not sure what's going on there, but she's pretty much destined to find out.</description>

  <description>Twenty-nine-year-old Satoru Fujinuma is floundering through life. Amid his daily drudgery, he finds himself in the grip of an incredible, inexplicable, and uncontrollable phenomenon that rewinds time, a condition that seems to only make his drab life worse. But then, one day, everything changes. A terrible incident forever changes Satoru's life as he knows it...and with it, comes a "Revival" that sends Satoru eighteen years into the past! &lt;br /&gt;In the body of his boyhood self, Satoru encounters sights he never imagined he would see again--the smile of his mother, alive and well, his old friends, and Kayo Hinazuki, the girl who was kidnapped and murdered when he was a boy the first time around. To return to the present and prevent the tragedy that brought him back to his childhood in the first place, Satoru begins plotting a way to change Hinazuki's fate...But up against the clock and a faceless evil, does eleven-year-old Satoru even stand a chance?</description>

  <description>The story of a mentally disabled man whose experimental quest for intelligence mirrors that of Algernon, an extraordinary lab mouse. In diary entries, Charlie tells how a brain operation increases his IQ and changes his life. As the experimental procedure takes effect, Charlie's intelligence expands until it surpasses that of the doctors who engineered his metamorphosis. The experiment seems to be a scientific breakthrough of paramount importance--until Algernon begins his sudden, unexpected deterioration. Will the same happen to Charlie?</description>

  <description>11 Hours and 48 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the edge of the Russian wilderness, winter lasts most of the year and the snowdrifts grow taller than houses. But Vasilisa doesn’t mind—she spends the winter nights huddled around the embers of a fire with her beloved siblings, listening to her nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, she loves the chilling story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon, who appears in the frigid night to claim unwary souls. Wise Russians fear him, her nurse says, and honor the spirits of house and yard and forest that protect their homes from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Vasilisa’s mother dies, her father goes to Moscow and brings home a new wife. Fiercely devout, city-bred, Vasilisa’s new stepmother forbids her family from honoring the household spirits. The family acquiesces, but Vasilisa is frightened, sensing that more hinges upon their rituals than anyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, crops begin to fail, evil creatures of the forest creep nearer, and misfortune stalks the village. All the while, Vasilisa’s stepmother grows ever harsher in her determination to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for either marriage or confinement in a convent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As danger circles, Vasilisa must defy even the people she loves and call on dangerous gifts she has long concealed—this, in order to protect her family from a threat that seems to have stepped from her nurse’s most frightening tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running time: 11 Hours and 48 Minutes</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this! I really enjoyed learning about a new type of mythology/folklore from Eastern Europe. I don't know much about Russian folklore, but this has inspired me to pick up more books on the subject matter. I want to know more after reading about Vasya and the house spirits and other beings...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length:&lt;/b&gt; 8 hrs sand 27 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inventive debut in the tradition of &lt;i&gt;World War Z &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Martian,&lt;/i&gt; told in interviews, journal entries, transcripts, and news articles, &lt;i&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/i&gt; is a thriller fueled by a quest for truth—and a fight for control of earthshaking power.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl named Rose is riding her new bike near her home in Deadwood, South Dakota, when she falls through the earth. She wakes up at the bottom of a square hole, its walls glowing with intricate carvings. But the firemen who come to save her peer down upon something even stranger: a little girl in the palm of a giant metal hand.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Seventeen years later, the mystery of the bizarre artifact remains unsolved—its origins, architects, and purpose unknown. Its carbon dating defies belief; military reports are redacted; theories are floated, then rejected.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But some can never stop searching for answers.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Rose Franklin is now a highly trained physicist leading a top secret team to crack the hand’s code. And along with her colleagues, she is being interviewed by a nameless interrogator whose power and purview are as enigmatic as the provenance of relic. What’s clear is that Rose and her compatriots are on the edge of unraveling history’s most perplexing discovery—and figuring out what it portends for humanity. But once the pieces of the puzzle are in place, will the result prove to be an instrument of lasting peace or a weapon of mass destruction?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;Sleeping Giants&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “This stellar debut novel . . . masterfully blends together elements of sci-fi, political thriller and apocalyptic fiction. . . . A page-turner of the highest order.”&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;—Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;The Martian &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; World War Z, Sleeping Giants&lt;/i&gt; is a luminous conspiracy yarn that shoots for (and lands among) the stars.”&lt;b&gt;—Pierce Brown, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of&lt;i&gt; Red Rising&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “First-time novelist Sylvain Neuvel does a bold, splashy cannonball off the high dive with Sleeping Giants. It bursts at the seams with big ideas and the questions they spawn—&lt;i&gt;How much human life is worth sacrificing in the pursuit of scientific progress? Can humanity be trusted with weapons of ultimate destruction? &lt;/i&gt;And the biggest: &lt;i&gt;Are we alone?&lt;/i&gt; But all that really matters is that this book is a sheer blast from start to finish. I haven’t had this much fun reading in ages.”&lt;b&gt;—Blake Crouch, author of Dark Matter and the bestselling Wayward Pines trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A breathtaking, enchanting new series by debut author Jessica Townsend, about a cursed girl who escapes death and finds herself in a magical world--but is then tested beyond her wildest imagination &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morrigan Crow is cursed. Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she's blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks--and, worst of all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Morrigan awaits her fate, a strange and remarkable man named Jupiter North appears. Chased by black-smoke hounds and shadowy hunters on horseback, he whisks her away into the safety of a secret, magical city called Nevermoor.&lt;br /&gt;It's then that Morrigan discovers Jupiter has chosen her to contend for a place in the city's most prestigious organization: the Wundrous Society. In order to join, she must compete in four difficult and dangerous trials against hundreds of other children, each boasting an extraordinary talent that sets them apart--an extraordinary talent that Morrigan insists she does not have. To stay in the safety of Nevermoor for good, Morrigan will need to find a way to pass the tests--or she'll have to leave the city to confront her deadly fate.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the astounding world of Mortal Engines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London is hunting again. Emerging from its hiding place in the hills, the great Traction City is chasing a terrified little town across the wastelands. Soon, London will feed. &lt;br /&gt;In the attack, Tom Natsworthy is flung from the speeding city with a murderous scar-faced girl. They must run for their lives through the wreckage--and face a terrifying new weapon that threatens the future of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Beloved storyteller Philip Reeve creates a brilliant new world in the Mortal Engines series, called "phenomenal...violent and romantic, action-packed and contemplative, funny and frightening" by the Sunday Times .</description>

      <![CDATA[I had never heard of this series before, but I saw the movie trailer and I knew I had to read the book. I enjoy YA, sci-fi, steampunk, and dystopia and this is a good mix of all of those. The plot is unique and the pacing was really good. <br /><br />This is set in a futuristic dystopian setting where towns...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An irreverent, hilarious insider's look at big-time NCAA basketball, through the eyes of the nation's most famous benchwarmer and author of the popular blog ClubTrillion.com (3.6m visits!). Mark Titus holds the Ohio State record for career wins, and made it to the 2007 national championship game. You would think Titus would be all over the highlight reels. You'd be wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In 2006, Mark Titus arrived on Ohio State's campus as a former high school basketball player who aspired to be an orthopedic surgeon. Somehow, he was added to the elite Buckeye basketball team, given a scholarship, and played alongside seven future NBA players on his way to setting the record for most individual career wins in Ohio State history. Think that's impressive? In four years, he scored a grand total of nine—yes, &lt;i&gt;nine&lt;/i&gt;—points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book will give readers an uncensored and uproarious look inside an elite NCAA basketball program from Titus's unique perspective. In his four years at the end of the bench, Mark founded his wildly popular blog Club Trillion, became a hero to all guys picked last, and even got scouted by the Harlem Globetrotters. Mark Titus is not your average basketball star. This is a wild and completely true story of the most unlikely career in college basketball. &lt;b&gt;A must-read for all fans of March Madness and college sports!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Deckard's assignment--find them and then..."retire" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!</description>

  <description>In this irresistible follow-up to her &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling debut,&lt;b&gt; Garden Spells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; author Sarah Addison Allen tells the tale of a young woman whose family secrets—and secret passions—are about to change her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Twenty-seven-year-old Josey Cirrini is sure of three things: winter in her North Carolina hometown is her favorite season, she’s a sorry excuse for a Southern belle, and sweets are best eaten in the privacy of her hidden closet. For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life in her mother’s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night…. Until she finds it harboring none other than local waitress Della Lee Baker, a tough-talking, tenderhearted woman who is one part nemesis—and two parts fairy godmother…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing a life of bad luck and big mistakes, Della Lee has decided Josey’s clandestine closet is the safest place to crash. In return she’s going to change Josey’s life—because, clearly, it is not the closet of a happy woman. With Della Lee’s tough love, Josey is soon forgoing pecan rolls and caramels, tapping into her startlingly keen feminine instincts, and finding her narrow existence quickly expanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Josey bonds with Chloe Finley, a young woman who makes the best sandwiches in town, is hounded by books that inexplicably appear whenever she needs them, and—most amazing of all—has a close connection to Josey’s longtime crush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As little by little Josey dares to step outside herself, she discovers a world where the color red has astonishing power, passion can make eggs fry in their cartons, and romance can blossom at any time—even for her. It seems that Della Lee’s work is done, and it’s time for her to move on. But the truth about where she’s going, why she showed up in the first place—and what Chloe has to do with it all—is about to add one more unexpected chapter to Josey’s fast-changing life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with warmth, wit, and a sprinkling of magic, here is a spellbinding tale of friendship, love—and the enchanting possibilities of every new day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Shakespeare’s plays weren’t meant to be read. They were meant…to be played.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Romeo never met Juliet? What if Juliet got really buff instead of moping around all day? What if they teamed up to take over Verona with robot suits? This choose-your-own-path version of Romeo and Juliet—packed with fun puzzles, secrets, and quadrillions of possible storylines—lets you decide where the plot goes every time you read. You might play as Romeo, or as Juliet, or as both of them at the same time. You might even unlock additional playable characters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s right. We figured out how to have unlockable characters in books.</description>

  <description>Harper Lee’s Pulitzer prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep south - and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred, available now for the first time as a digital audiobook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the 20th century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father - a crusading local lawyer - risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©1988 Harper Lee (P)2006 HarperCollins Publishers</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Black Tides of Heaven &lt;/i&gt;is one of a pair of standalone introductions to JY Yang's Tensorate Series. For more of the story you can read its twin novella &lt;i&gt;The Red Threads of Fortune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mokoya and Akeha, the twin children of the Protector, were sold to the Grand Monastery as children. While Mokoya developed her strange prophetic gift, Akeha was always the one who could see the strings that moved adults to action. While his sister received visions of what would be, Akeha realized what could be. What's more, he saw the sickness at the heart of his mother's Protectorate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rebellion is growing. The Machinists discover new levers to move the world every day, while the Tensors fight to put them down and preserve the power of the state. Unwilling to continue to play a pawn in his mother's twisted schemes, Akeha leaves the Tensorate behind and falls in with the rebels. But every step Akeha takes towards the Machinists is a step away from his sister Mokoya. Can Akeha find peace without shattering the bond he shares with his twin sister?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Death wasn’t the end, it was only the beginning…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sybella has always been the darkest of Death’s daughters, trained at the convent of Saint Mortain to serve as his justice. But she has a new mission now. In a desperate bid to keep her two youngest sisters safe from the family that nearly destroyed them all, she agrees to accompany the duchess to France, where they quickly find themselves surrounded by enemies. Their one ray of hope is Sybella’s fellow novitiates, disguised and hidden deep in the French court years ago by the convent—provided Sybella can find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genevieve has been undercover for so many years, she struggles to remember who she is or what she’s supposed to be fighting for. Her only solace is a hidden prisoner who appears all but forgotten by his guards. When tragedy strikes, she has no choice but to take matters into her own hands—even if it means ignoring the long awaited orders from the convent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sybella and Gen’s paths draw ever closer, the fate of everything they hold sacred rests on a knife’s edge. Will they find each other in time, or will their worlds collide, destroying everything they care about?</description>

  <description>It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>10 hours, 21 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years-long &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller soon to be a major motion picture from Spielberg’s Dreamworks that is “irresistible…seductive…with a high concept plot that keeps you riveted from the first page” (&lt;i&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four harrowing years on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns to Australia and takes a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day’s journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby’s cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom, who keeps meticulous records and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel insists the baby is a “gift from God,” and against Tom’s judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them.</description>

  <description>In the wake of death and betrayal, Vala flees the island of Garlin with Xavyn in search of the truth about her identity. &lt;br /&gt;To find the answers they seek, they must first cross The Divide—a mass of cloud and fog that has separated human lands from the rest of the world for hundreds of years. As they pass through what is meant to kill all who draw near, a surge of magic emerges, bringing death to some and more power to others. In turn, The Divide is weakened, the fog dissolving enough to reveal what lies beyond, reigniting thoughts of war between sides. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the imminent collapse of The Divide isn’t the only thing concerning Vala and Xavyn. They discover what Vala needs the most is also what the Islain queen had been searching for—a feather. Not only could it help prevent war, it could restore Vala’s immortality despite all she has forgotten. Though there are others also searching, waiting for magic to return, prepared to risk it all for the same immortal goal.</description>

  <description>I have loved Channing Monroe all my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In first grade, he asked for my Trapper Keeper. &lt;br /&gt;I hit him in the head with it. &lt;br /&gt;Third grade, we were best friends. We kissed in seventh grade. &lt;br /&gt;Eighth grade, he turned into a bad boy and the rest was a tumultuous storm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, the problem was never love for us. &lt;br /&gt;Bad times. Good times. There were times when I felt our love in every inch of my body, vibrating, making me feel like it could bring me back to life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that we’re living in two different worlds now. &lt;br /&gt;Fallen Crest and its millionaires for me. Roussou and their criminals for him. I was thriving in mine and he was running his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were nights I felt we couldn’t be further apart than we were, and there were nights I felt we shared the same heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When was it time? &lt;br /&gt;When was it time to either sacrifice, make a change, or walk away from the boy I grew up with?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first rule is that you don’t fall in love. There are other rules too, but that is the main one. No falling in love. No staying in love. No daydreaming of love. Because otherwise, of course, you slowly lose your mind . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hazard has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary forty-one-year-old, but he was born in 1581. Owing to a rare condition, he’s been alive for centuries. From Shakespeare’s England to Jazz Age Paris to voyaging the Pacific alongside Captain Cook, Tom has seen a lot, and he now craves an ordinary life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always changing his identity to stay alive, Tom now has the perfect cover—working as a history teacher at a London school. Here, he can teach the kids about wars and witch hunts as if he’d never witnessed them first-hand. He can try to tame the past that is quickly catching up with him. The only thing Tom can’t do is fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Stop Time&lt;/em&gt; is a wild, bittersweet, time-travelling story about losing and finding yourself, about the certainty of change, about the mistakes humans are doomed to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about the lifetimes it can take to learn how to live.</description>

R. Martin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eugenides, no stranger to desperate circumstances, has gotten himself into difficulties he can’t get out of. Used to being treated with a certain measure of wariness, if not respect, he suffers the pranks, insults, and intrigue of the Attolian court with dwindling patience. As usual, nothing is as it appears when he rescues a hot-headed young soldier in the Palace Guard. The Queen’s Thief novels have been praised by writers, critics, reviewers, and fans and have been honored with glowing reviews, “best of” citations, and numerous awards, including the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Prize, a Newbery Honor, the Andre Norton Award shortlist, and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Discover and rediscover the stand-alone companions, &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Attolia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The King of Attolia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Conspiracy of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Thick as Thieves, &lt;/em&gt;all epic novels set in the world of the Queen’s Thief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; Best Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horn Book&lt;/em&gt; Fanfare&lt;br /&gt;ALA Top 10 Best Book for Young Adults&lt;br /&gt;New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Queen’s Thief books awe and inspire me.

  <description>THE NEW NOVEL FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;READY PLAYER ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just another day of high school for Zack Lightman. He's daydreaming through another boring math class, with just one more month to go until graduation and freedom—if he can make it that long without getting suspended again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he glances out his classroom window and spots the flying saucer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Zack thinks he’s going crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minute later, he’s sure of it. Because the UFO he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called &lt;i&gt;Armada—&lt;/i&gt;in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Zack’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet even as he and his new comrades scramble to prepare for the alien onslaught, Zack can’t help thinking of all the science-fiction books, TV shows, and movies he grew up reading and watching, and wonder: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little too… &lt;i&gt;familiar? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armada &lt;/i&gt;is at once a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien-invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with author Ernest Cline’s trademark pop-culture savvy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A series of chance encounters leads to a sizzling new romance from the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of the On Dublin Street series. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The universe is conspiring against Ava Breevort. As if flying back to Phoenix to bury a childhood friend wasn't hell enough, a cloud of volcanic ash traveling from overseas delayed her flight back home to Boston. Her last ditch attempt to salvage the trip was thwarted by an arrogant Scotsman, Caleb Scott, who steals a first class seat out from under her. Then over the course of their journey home, their antagonism somehow lands them in bed for the steamiest layover Ava's ever had. And that's all it was--until Caleb shows up on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pure chance pulls Ava back into Caleb's orbit, he proposes they enjoy their physical connection while he's stranded in Boston. Ava agrees, knowing her heart's in no danger since a) she barely likes Caleb and b) his existence in her life is temporary. Not long thereafter Ava realizes she's made a terrible error because as it turns out Caleb Scott isn't quite so unlikeable after all. When his stay in Boston becomes permanent, Ava must decide whether to fight her feelings for him or give into them. But even if she does decide to risk her heart on Caleb, there is no guarantee her stubborn Scot will want to risk his heart on her....</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Trinity Marrow may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her unique gift is part of a secret so dangerous that she’s been in hiding for years in an isolated compound fiercely guarded by Wardens—gargoyle shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her, flesh and bone, to enhance their own powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wardens from another clan arrive with disturbing reports that something out there is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s safe world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own that will upend her world yet again—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to put her trust in Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…</description>

  <description>A propulsive debut novel with the intensity of Luckiest Girl Alive and Before the Fall, about a young woman determined to survive and a mother determined to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your life is a lie, the truth can kill you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her fiancé’s private plane crashes in the Colorado Rockies, Allison Carpenter miraculously survives. But the fight for her life is just beginning. For years, Allison has been living with a terrible secret, a shocking truth that powerful men will kill to keep buried. If they know she’s alive, they will come for her. She must make it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small community of Owl Creek, Maine, Maggie Carpenter learns that her only child is presumed dead. But authorities have not recovered her body—giving Maggie a shred of hope. She, too, harbors a shameful secret: she hasn’t communicated with her daughter in two years, since a family tragedy drove Allison away. Maggie doesn’t know anything about her daughter’s life now—not even that she was engaged to wealthy pharmaceutical CEO Ben Gardner, or why she was on a private plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Allison struggles across the treacherous mountain wilderness, Maggie embarks on a desperate search for answers. Immersing herself in Allison’s life, she discovers a sleek socialite hiding dark secrets. What was Allison running from—and can Maggie uncover the truth in time to save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from the perspectives of a mother and daughter separated by distance but united by an unbreakable bond, Freefall is a riveting debut novel about two tenacious women overcoming unimaginable obstacles to protect themselves and those they love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first book in a brutally stunning series where a young girl finds herself becoming more monster than human and must uncover dangerous truths about who she is and the place that has become her home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the last child in a family of daughters, seventeen-year-old Janneke was raised to be the male heir. While her sisters were becoming wives and mothers, she was taught to hunt, track, and fight. On the day her village was burned to the ground, Janneke—as the only survivor—was taken captive by the malicious Lydian and eventually sent to work for his nephew Soren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janneke’s survival in the court of merciless monsters has come at the cost of her connection to the human world. And when the Goblin King’s death ignites an ancient hunt for the next king, Soren senses an opportunity for her to finally fully accept the ways of the brutal Permafrost. But every action he takes to bring her deeper into his world only shows him that a little humanity isn’t bad—especially when it comes to those you care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through every battle they survive, Janneke’s loyalty to Soren deepens. After dangerous truths are revealed, Janneke must choose between holding on or letting go of her last connections to a world she no longer belongs to. She must make the right choice to save the only thing keeping both worlds from crumbling.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS... FOR THE LAST TIME.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The season of endings grows darker as civilization fades into the long cold night. Alabaster Tenring – madman, world-crusher, savior – has returned with a mission: to train his successor, Essun, and thus seal the fate of the Stillness forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It continues with a lost daughter, found by the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It continues with the obelisks, and an ancient mystery converging on answers at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stillness is the wall which stands against the flow of tradition, the spark of hope long buried under the thickening ashfall. And it will not be broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dark pasts and forbidden romances haunt three ambitious sisters as they fight to inherit the throne in this sequel to &lt;i&gt;Rule&lt;/i&gt;, which &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elly Blake called "dazzling" and "pulse-pounding."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sisters Akeylah, Ren, and Zofi are all a step closer to their dying father's throne, a step closer to the crown that will allow one of them to rule over Kolonya. But the sisters' pasts continue to haunt them. Each hides a secret marked with blood and betrayal, and now their blackmailer is holding nothing back. When King Andros discovers the sisters' traitorous pasts, the consequences will shake the entire kingdom to its core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kolonya's greatest threat stalks closer and closer, weaving a web of fear and deceit around Ren, Zofi, and Akeylah, even the people they love are under suspicion. If the sisters are going to survive, they'll have to learn to trust each other above all else and work together, not only to save themselves, but to protect everyone and everything they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shocking reveals and suspenseful storytelling, this breathtaking sequel to &lt;i&gt;Rule&lt;/i&gt; will keep you guessing until the very last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to the instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Furyborn&lt;/i&gt;, two queens, separated by a thousand years, connected by secrets and lies, must continue their fight amid deadly plots and unthinkable betrayals that will test their strength—and their hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rielle Dardenne has been anointed Sun Queen, but her trials are far from over. The Gate keeping the angels at bay is falling. To repair it, Rielle must collect the seven hidden castings of the saints. Meanwhile, to help her prince and love Audric protect Celdaria, Rielle must spy on the angel Corien—but his promises of freedom and power may prove too tempting to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries later, Eliana Ferracora grapples with her new reality: She is the Sun Queen, humanity's long-awaited savior. But fear of corruption—fear of becoming another Rielle—keeps Eliana's power dangerous and unpredictable. Hunted by all, racing against time to save her dying friend Navi, Eliana must decide how to wear a crown she never wanted—by embracing her mother's power, or rejecting it forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beware of the woods and the dark, dank deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: the new girl. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Discover the world of the Queen’s Thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author Megan Whalen Turner’s entrancing and award-winning Queen’s Thief novels bring to life the world of the epics and feature one of the most charismatic and incorrigible characters of fiction, Eugenides the thief. Megan Whalen Turner’s Queen’s Thief novels are rich with political machinations and intrigue, battles lost and won, dangerous journeys, divine intervention, power, passion, revenge, and deception&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo, Marie Lu, Patrick Rothfuss, and George R. R. Martin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brilliant thief Eugenides has visited the Queen of Attolia’s palace one too many times, leaving small tokens and then departing unseen. When his final excursion does not go as planned, he is captured by the ruthless queen. The Queen’s Thief novels have been praised by writers, critics, reviewers, and fans and have been honored with glowing reviews, “best of” citations, and numerous awards, including the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Prize, a Newbery Honor, the Andre Norton Award shortlist, and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Discover and rediscover the stand-alone companions, &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Attolia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The King of Attolia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Conspiracy of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Thick as Thieves,&lt;/em&gt; all epic novels set in the world of the Queen’s Thief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; Top 10 Fantasy Books for Youth&lt;br /&gt;ALA Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults&lt;br /&gt;A New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age&lt;br /&gt;Parent’s Choice Gold Award &lt;br /&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books&lt;/em&gt; Blue Ribbon Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Queen’s Thief books awe and inspire me. They have the feel of a secret, discovered history of real but forgotten lands. The plot-craft is peerless, the revelations stunning, and the characters flawed, cunning, heartbreaking, exceptional. Megan Whalen Turner’s books have a permanent spot on my favorites shelf, with space waiting for more books to come.”—Laini Taylor, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author of the Daughter of Smoke and Bone novels and &lt;em&gt;Strange the Dreamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Unforgettable characters, plot twists that will make your head spin, a world rendered in elegant detail—you will fall in love with every page of these stories. Megan Whalen Turner writes vivid, immersive, heartbreaking fantasy that will leave you desperate to return to Attolia again and again.”—Leigh Bardugo, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;—bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Six of Crows&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crooked Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Megan Whalen Turner proves to be one of the brightest creative talents. With each book, she continues to add new levels and new luster to her sparkling imagination.”—Lloyd Alexander, Newbery Medalist and National Book Award-winning author of The Chronicles of Prydain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Readers will be spellbound.”—&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Turner’s storytelling is so sure that readers will want to go along with her—and discover whatever it is that Eugenides will do next.”—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“[An] intense read . . . thoroughly involving and wholly satisfying on all fronts.”—&lt;em&gt;The Horn Book&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Assured, compelling, and hypnotically readable—with a twist at the end I guarantee you won’t see coming” (&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lee Child), T. M. Logan’s debut psychological thriller dissects a troubled marriage straight to the marrow as one man separates the truth from the &lt;i&gt;Lies&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six days ago, Joe Lynch was a happily married man, a devoted father, and a respected teacher living in a well-to-do London suburb. But that was before he spotted his wife’s car entering a hotel parking garage. Before he saw her in a heated argument with her best friend’s husband. Before Joe confronted the other man in an altercation where he left him for dead, bleeding and unconscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Joe’s life is unraveling. His wife has lied to him. Her deception has put their entire family in jeopardy. The man she met at the hotel has vanished. And as the police investigate his disappearance, suspicion falls on Joe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to trust the woman he loves, Joe finds himself at the mercy of her revelations and deceits, unsure of who or what to believe. All he knows is that her actions have brought someone dangerous into their lives—someone obsessed with her and determined to tear Joe’s world apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if your whole life was based on LIES&lt;/i&gt;?</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Samantha Young… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn O’Dea has always tried to see the best in people while her big brother, Killian, has always tried to protect her from the worst. While their lonely upbringing made Killian a cynic, it isn’t in Autumn’s nature to be anything but warm and open. However, after a series of relationship disasters and the unsettling realization that she’s drifting aimlessly through life, Autumn wonders if she’s left herself too vulnerable to the world. Deciding some distance from the security blanket of her brother and an unmotivated life in Glasgow is exactly what she needs to find herself, Autumn takes up her friend’s offer to stay at a ski resort in the snowy hills of Montana. Some guy-free alone time on Whitetail Mountain sounds just the thing to get to know herself better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, she wasn’t counting on colliding into sexy Grayson King on the slopes. Autumn has never met anyone like Gray. Confident, smart, with a wicked sense of humor, he makes the men she dated seem like boys. Her attraction to him immediately puts her on the defense because being open-hearted in the past has only gotten it broken. Yet it becomes increasingly difficult to resist a man who is not only determined to seduce her, but adamant about helping her find her purpose in life and embrace the person she is. Autumn knows she shouldn’t fall for Gray. It can only end badly. After all their lives are divided by an ocean and their inevitable separation is just another heart break away… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kristen Proby Crossover Collection features a new novel by Kristen Proby and six by some of her favorite writers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristen Proby – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401054.Soaring_with_Fallon" title="Soaring with Fallon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soaring with Fallon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Bennett – &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39401055.Wicked_Force" title="Wicked Force" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;K.L.

  <description>What if you had a power you had to hide from everyone--until now? In this bold sci-fi action thriller, a secret training program at West Point is turning misfits into a new generation of heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Scarlett Winter has always been an outsider, and not only because she's a hardcore daredevil and born troublemaker--she has been hiding superhuman powers she doesn't yet understand. Now she's been recruited by a secret West Point unit for cadets with extraordinary abilities. Scarlett and her fellow students are learning to hone their skills, from telekinetic combat to running recon missions through strangers' dreamscapes.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;At The Point, &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Scarlett discovers that she may be the most powerful cadet of all. With the power to control pure energy, she's a human nuclear bomb--and she's not sure she can control her powers much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in this army of outsiders, Scarlett feels like a misfit all over again, but when a threat that endangers her fellow students arises from the school's dark past, duty calls and Scarlett must make a choice between being herself and becoming something even greater: a hero.</description>

  <description>A fierce sequel full of sisterhood, heart pounding action, betrayal, and intrigue in the royal court in a series that "breathes new life into the feminist story of oppression and resistance" (Publisher's Weekly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banished by Asa at the end of Grace and Fury, Nomi and Malachi find themselves powerless and headed towards their all-but-certain deaths. Now that Asa sits on the throne, he will stop at nothing to make sure Malachi never sets foot in the palace again. Their only hope is to find Nomi's sister, Serina, on the prison island of Mount Ruin. But when Nomi and Malachi arrive, it is not the island of conquered, broken women that they expected. It is an island in the grip of revolution, and Serina--polite, submissive Serina--is its leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayal, grief, and violence have changed both sisters, and the women of Mount Ruin have their sights set on revenge beyond the confines of their island prison. They plan to sweep across the entire kingdom, issuing in a new age of freedom for all. But first they'll have to get rid of Asa, and only Nomi knows how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separated once again, this time by choice, Nomi and Serina must forge their own paths as they aim to tear down the world they know, and build something better in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stakes are higher and the battles bolder in Tracy Banghart's unputdownable sequel to Grace and Fury.</description>

  <description>In a world where women have no rights, sisters Serina and Nomi Tessaro face two very different fates: one in the palace, the other in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serina has been groomed her whole life to become a Grace - someone to stand by the heir to the throne as a shining, subjugated example of the perfect woman. But when her headstrong and rebellious younger sister, Nomi, catches the heir's eye, it's Serina who takes the fall for the dangerous secret that Nomi has been hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now trapped in a life she never wanted, Nomi has only one way to save Serina: surrender to her role as a Grace until she can use her position to release her sister. This is easier said than done. A traitor walks the halls of the palace, and deception lurks in every corner. But Serina is running out of time, imprisoned on an island where she must fight to the death to survive and one wrong move could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Three girls with three deadly secrets. Only one can wear the crown.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The king is dying, his heir has just been murdered, and rebellion brews in the east. But the kingdom of Kolonya and the outer Reaches has one last option before it descends into leaderless chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or rather, three unexpected options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zofi has spent her entire life trekking through the outer Reaches with her band of Travelers. She would do anything to protect the band, her family. But no one can ever find out how far she's already gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akeylah was raised in the Eastern Reach, surrounded by whispers of rebellion and abused by her father. Desperate to escape, she makes a decision that threatens the whole kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren grew up in Kolonya, serving as a lady's maid and scheming her way out of the servants' chambers. But one such plot could get her hung for treason if anyone ever discovers what she's done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the king summons the girls, they arrive expecting arrest or even execution. Instead they learn the truth: they are his illegitimate daughters, and one must become his new heir. But someone in Kolonya knows their secrets, and that someone will stop at nothing to keep the sisters from their destiny... to rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic, mystery, and blackmail abound in this sensational and striking fantasy debut.</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Three hundred years ago, fate bound Prosper Redding and Prince Alastor of the Third Realm together. Now the human boy and fiend heir to the demon kingdom must put aside a centuries-old blood feud to save everything they love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alastor will guide Prosper through the demon realm—under one huge condition: Prosper must enter into a contract with the malefactor residing in him, promising eternal servitude in the afterlife. With Prosper's sister in the clutches of the evil queen Pyra, Prosper has no choice but to agree. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they arrive in Alastor's deliciously demonic home, the realm is almost as alien to Alastor as it is to Prosper—the lowest fiends have dethroned the ruling malefactors, while an unfathomable force called the Void is swiftly consuming the realm. The desperate fiends cling to the one person who says she can stop it: Pyra. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Prosper embarks on a perilous rescue mission to the Tower of No Return, he can't help but feel for the demons losing their home—even Alastor, who lives by a set of rules that have vanished in a new world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the fates of humans and demons at odds, the battle lines are drawn. Long ago, Prosper's ancestor Honor Redding proved that humans and demons could never be friends. But is Prosper like his ancestor? And is Alastor the same demon who was betrayed by the one human he cared for?</description>

  <description>An evil legacy comes to life in this classic and ultimately human novel about believable vampires, featuring a brand-new introduction by Dan Simmons. Children of the Night will take you to a place that no one knows—yet all of us fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a desolate orphanage in post-Communist Romania, a desperately ill infant is given the wrong blood transfusion—and flourishes rather than dies. For immunologist Kate Neuman, the infant’s immune system may hold the key to cure cancer and AIDS. Kate adopts the baby and takes him home to the States. But baby Joshua holds a link to an ancient clan and their legendary leader—Vlad Tşepeş, the original Dracula – whose agents kidnap the child. Against impossible odds and vicious enemies– both human and vampire – Kate and her ally, Father Mike O’Rourke, steal into Romania to get her baby back.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprises aren’t always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.</description>

  <description>Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo's new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she's always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to put a stop to Hideo's grim plans, Emika and the Phoenix Riders band together, only to find a new threat lurking on the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Someone's put a bounty on Emika's head, and her sole chance for survival lies with Zero and the Blackcoats, his ruthless crew. But Emika soon learns that Zero isn't all that he seems--and his protection comes at a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in a web of betrayal, with the future of free will at risk, just how far will Emika go to take down the man she loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/i&gt;, a novel about what it takes to become a vampire. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in contemporary Paris and London, and the American colonies during the upheaval and unrest that exploded into the Revolutionary War, a sweeping story that braids together the past and present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life, free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus’s deeply-held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities for change, Time’s Convert will delight fans of the All Souls trilogy and all readers of magic, the supernatural, and romance.</description>

  <description>You think you know the story of The Little Mermaid... &lt;br /&gt;A tragic accident on the eve of her eighteenth birthday leads Princess Erica to a chance encounter with a mysterious man on the beach. When he turns up at her birthday party and whisks her off her feet, she knows she has to find out everything about him, but why won't he speak and where does he keep disappearing to? &lt;br /&gt;Ari knows he's crossed a line by mingling with the land humans, but how can he resist the beautiful princess whose life he saved? He must decide whether to stay on land and become like her, or continue to live without her in the depths of the ocean. &lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a centuries long battle between his kind and hers, his decision will rock both their kingdoms. &lt;br /&gt;With a sea witch that needs repaying and the small matter of Erica's engagement to someone else, Ari knows the odds are stacked against him. &lt;br /&gt;Dark Water is the fourth in the Reverse Fairytale series and the first Little Mermaid retelling by USA Today bestselling author J.A.Armitage. Take everything you think you know about fairytales and turn it on its head. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I am Comet Caldwell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I sort of, kind of, absolutely hate my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People expect extraordinary things from a girl named Comet. That she’ll be effortlessly cool and light up a room the way a comet blazes across the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But from the shyness that makes her book-character friends more appealing than real people to the parents whose indifference hurts more than an open wound, Comet has never wanted to be the center of attention. She can’t wait to graduate from her high school in Edinburgh, Scotland, where the only place she ever feels truly herself is on her anonymous poetry blog. But surely that will change once she leaves to attend university somewhere far, far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When new student Tobias King blazes in from America and shakes up the school, Comet thinks she’s got the bad boy figured out. Until they’re thrown together for a class assignment and begin to form an unlikely connection. Everything shifts in Comet’s ordinary world. Tobias has a dark past and runs with a tough crowd—and none of them are happy about his interest in Comet. Targeted by bullies and thrown into the spotlight, Comet and Tobias can go their separate ways…or take a risk on something extraordinary.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now a major motion picture from Summit Entertainment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R is having a no-life crisis—he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he’d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he meets a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First as his captive, then his reluctant guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R’s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn't want to eat this girl—although she looks delicious—he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can’t imagine, and their hopeless world won’t change without a fight.</description>

  <description>Meet Hanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He’s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she’ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Suzette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna’s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette's husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there’s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn’t the best place for their baby girl after all.</description>

  <description>George Orwell depicts a gray, totalitarian world dominated by Big Brother and its vast network of agents, including the Thought Police, a world in which news is manufactured according to the authorities' will and people live tepid lives by rote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winston Smith, the hero with no heroic qualities, longs only for truth and decency. But living in a social system in which privacy does not exist and where those with unorthodox ideas are brainwashed or put to death, he knows there is no hope for him. He knows even as he continues to pursue his forbidden love affair that eventually he will come to destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year 1984 has come and gone, yet George Orwell's nightmare vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is still the great modern classic of negative Utopia. It is a prophetic and haunting tale that exposes the worst crimes imaginable: the destruction of freedom and truth.</description>

  <description>"A fast-moving, eerie...tale set on Halloween night. Eight costumed boys running to meet their friend Pipkin at the haunted house outside town encounter instead the huge and cadaverous Mr. Moundshroud. As Pipkin scrambles to join them, he is swept away by a dark Something, and Moundshroud leads the boys on the tail of a kite through time and space to search the past for their friend and the meaning of Halloween. After witnessing a funeral procession in ancient Egypt, cavemen discovering fire, Druid rites, the persecution of witches in the Dark Ages, and the gargoyles of Notre Dame, they catch up with the elusive Pipkin in the catacombs of Mexico, where each boy gives one year from the end of his life to save Pipkin's. Enhanced by appropriately haunting black-and-white drawings."--Booklist</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>Nahri has never believed in magic. Certainly, she has power; on the streets of 18th century Cairo, she’s a con woman of unsurpassed talent. But she knows better than anyone that the trade she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, healings—are all tricks, sleights of hand, learned skills; a means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass?a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that city, behind gilded brass walls laced with enchantments, behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments are simmering. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, she learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics. That even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, there is a reason they say be careful what you wish for . . .</description>

  <description>When Ichabod Crane arrives in the spooky little village of Sleepy Hollow as the new schoolmaster, Katrina Van Tassel is instantly drawn to him. Through their shared love of books and music, they form a friendship that quickly develops into romance. Ichabod knows that as an itinerant schoolteacher of little social standing, he has nothing to offer the wealthy Katrina – unlike her childhood friend-turned-enemy, Brom Van Brunt, who is the suitor Katrina’s father favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when romance gives way to passion, Ichabod and Katrina embark on a secret love affair, sneaking away into the woods after dark to be together – all while praying they do not catch sight of Sleepy Hollow’s legendary Headless Horseman. That is, until All Hallows’s Eve, when Ichabod suddenly disappears, leaving Katrina alone and in a perilous position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisting the help of her friend – and rumored witch – Charlotte Jansen, Katrina seeks the truth of Ichabod Crane’s disappearance, investigating the forest around Sleepy Hollow using unconventional – often magical – means. What they find forces Katrina to question everything she once knew, and to wonder if the Headless Horseman is perhaps more than just a story after all. In Alyssa Palombo's &lt;i&gt;The Spellbook of Katrina Van Tassel &lt;/i&gt;nothing is as it seems, and love is a thing even death won't erase.</description>

  <description>A collection of four chilling novels, ingeniously wrought gems of terror from the brilliantly imaginative, Joe Hill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snapshot&lt;/i&gt; is the disturbing story of a Silicon Valley adolescent who finds himself threatened by “The Phoenician,” a tattooed thug who possesses a Polaroid Instant Camera that erases memories, snap by snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young man takes to the skies to experience his first parachute jump. . . and winds up a castaway on an impossibly solid cloud, a Prospero’s island of roiling vapor that seems animated by a mind of its own in &lt;i&gt;Aloft&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a seemingly ordinary day in Boulder, Colorado, the clouds open up in a downpour of nails—splinters of bright crystal that shred the skin of anyone not safely under cover. &lt;i&gt;Rain&lt;/i&gt; explores this escalating apocalyptic event, as the deluge of nails spreads out across the country and around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt;, a mall security guard in a coastal Florida town courageously stops a mass shooting and becomes a hero to the modern gun rights movement. But under the glare of the spotlights, his story begins to unravel, taking his sanity with it. When an out-of-control summer blaze approaches the town, he will reach for the gun again and embark on one last day of reckoning.</description>

  <description>Getting dumped four times over the course of the past ten years on Valentine’s Day was definitely not in Hazel Benny’s life plan. So when her boyfriend of three months dumps her a week before Valentine’s Day to save her the humiliation of a fifth VD dumping, Hazel decides to take a break from life altogether by borrowing her brother’s camper van and taking off to the highlands.&lt;br /&gt;Life in the camper van is going great—fresh air, beautiful scenery, a deeper bond with her homeland, no work, and best of all no men!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Valentine’s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting caught in the woods with her pants down is the last thing Hazel expected to happen to her on the dreaded romantic day. Worse still getting caught by attractive American, Liam Brody, an annoyingly sexy man the universe seems intent on throwing her way for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time this year’s Valentine’s Day is over, Hazel will have only one question on her mind:&lt;br /&gt;How could one day, one tiny little day, change her life so epically…</description>

  <description>The crew of the Prometheus is intent on taking down the world’s clock towers so that time can run freely. Now captives, Colton, Daphne, and the others have a stark choice: join the Prometheus’s cause, or fight back in any small way they can and face the consequences. But Zavier, leader of the terrorists, has a bigger plan—to bring back the lost god of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As new threats emerge, loyalties must shift. No matter where the Prometheus goes—Prague, Austria, India—nowhere is safe, and every second ticks closer toward the eleventh hour. Walking the line between villainy and heroism, each will have to choose what's most important: saving those you love at the expense of the many, or making impossible sacrifices for the sake of a better world.</description>

  <description>One punch took him from Hollywood’s Golden Boy to Bad Boy Brody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The media didn’t care he was grieving his brother’s death. They descended on him, but to change his reputation, his manager got him a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Act in an indie film, one that already had Oscar buzz, and he’d get the movie roles he needed to secure his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He took the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he wasn’t prepared for the real-life people behind the script. He wasn’t prepared for the murder the movie was based on. And he really wasn’t prepared for &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;, the biggest secret of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was wild. She was beautiful. She defied gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But was &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; the leading role that would tame him?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As a child, Rose Franklin made an astonishing discovery: a giant metallic hand, buried deep within the earth. As an adult, she’s dedicated her brilliant scientific career to solving the mystery that began that fateful day: Why was a titanic robot of unknown origin buried in pieces around the world? Years of investigation have produced intriguing answers—and even more perplexing questions. But the truth is closer than ever before when a second robot, more massive than the first, materializes and lashes out with deadly force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now humankind faces a nightmare invasion scenario made real, as more colossal machines touch down across the globe. But Rose and her team at the Earth Defense Corps refuse to surrender. They can turn the tide if they can unlock the last secrets of an advanced alien technology. The greatest weapon humanity wields is knowledge in a do-or-die battle to inherit the Earth . . . and maybe even the stars.</description>

  <description>Clock mechanic Danny Hart knows he's being watched. But by whom, or what, remains a mystery. To make matters worse, clock towers have begun falling in India, though time hasn't Stopped yet. He'd hoped after reuniting with his father and exploring his relationship with Colton, he'd have some to settle into his new life. Instead, he's asked to investigate the attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After inspecting some of the fallen Indian towers, he realizes the British occupation may be sparking more than just attacks. And as Danny and Colton unravel more secrets about their past, they find themselves on a dark and dangerous path-one from which they may never return.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A (brokenhearted) physicist.&lt;br /&gt;Now an infamous (who is LITERALLY EVERYWHERE!! UGH!) musician.&lt;br /&gt;The worst has already happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona has learned that she has nothing figured out and plans are meaningless. After leaving her in Aspen, Abram is now breaking sales-records, rising to rock star fame almost overnight. Mona can’t seem to escape him. He is literally everywhere, or at least images of him are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when she thinks things can't get any more confusing, Abram returns . . . What happens next? Only TIME will tell.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week.&lt;br /&gt;Private cabin.&lt;br /&gt;Famous physicist.&lt;br /&gt;Still an unrepentant slacker.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona’s meticulously planned allotment of relaxation is thrown into chaos by the unscheduled appearance of her older brother’s band of friends, including the one person she'd hoped to never face again. Abram still makes her feel entirely too much, which is one of the reasons she disappeared after their one week together. But now, trapped on a mountain of snow and things unspoken, Mona will have to find a way to coexist with Abram, chaos and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laws of Physics parts 1 (MOTION) &amp;amp; 2 (SPACE) end with a cliffhanger.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe's place of exile, entwining their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe's independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Eliyana Ember is stranded in a foreign country in the Third Reflection with no passport, the inability to mirrorwalk, and zero clue where the nearest Thresholds back into the Fourth or Second might lie. Her mind is a haze, her memories vague. She knows a wormhole from the Fourth sent her here. She remembers her mom and baby brother Evan. Makai and Stormy and Joshua . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep down El realizes she must end the Void once and for all. Is there a way to trap the darkness within its current vessel, kill it off completely? To do so would mean sacrificing another soul—the soul of a man Joshua claims is a traitor. But he’s lied to her before, and even El senses Joshua can’t be fully trusted, but one thing is certain . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Void must be annihilated. And only the Verity—the light which birthed the darkness—can put an end to that which seeks to kill and destroy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I hate to do this, but I really struggled with this book. My review is going to be critical, I’m OK with the ending but I did not enjoy how we got there in this installment. It took far too long to resolve things from the 2nd book and actually get to the plot of the 3rd book. I enjoyed Unblemishe...]]>

  <description>Adeluna is a soldier. Five years ago, she helped the magic-rich island of Grace Loray overthrow its oppressor, Argrid, a country ruled by religion. But adjusting to postwar life has not been easy. When an Argridian delegate vanishes during peace talks with Grace Loray’s new Council, Argrid demands brutal justice—but Lu suspects something more dangerous is at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devereux is a pirate. As one of the outlaws called stream raiders who run rampant on Grace Loray, he pirates the island’s magic plants and sells them on the black market. But after Argrid accuses raiders of the diplomat’s abduction, Vex becomes a target. An expert navigator, he agrees to help Lu find the Argridian—but the truth they uncover could be deadlier than any war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benat is a heretic. The crown prince of Argrid, he harbors a secret obsession with Grace Loray’s forbidden magic. When Ben’s father, the king, gives him the shocking task of reversing Argrid’s fear of magic, Ben has to decide if one prince can change a devout country—or if he’s building his own pyre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As conspiracies arise, Lu, Vex, and Ben will have to decide who they really are . . . and what they are willing to become for peace.</description>

      <![CDATA[This took me a while to get into, the story is slower paced than Raasch's previous series but I eventually got engaged in the storyline and there were quite a few plot twists towards the end that I really didn't see coming. I tend to have a hard time with books that follow more than one perspecti...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York’s Finest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogging as *The Socialmedialite*&lt;br /&gt;April 22&lt;br /&gt;LADIES AND GENTS! I have an announcement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that guy I featured on my blog a few months ago? The really, really hot Irish rugby player who plays the position of ‘hooker’ in the RLI (Rugby League International)? The one with the anger management issues, the body of a gladiator and the face of a movie star? The one with the questionable fashion choices leading me to ask whether he was the lovechild of a leprechaun and a hobbit? Ronan Fitzpatrick? Yeah, that guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have a confession to make…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HERMIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Catrel, social media expert extraordinaire at Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media and clandestine celebrity blogger, can make anyone shine in the court of public opinion. She is the Socialmedialite, anonymous creator of New York’s Finest and the internet’s darling. Virtual reality is Annie’s forte, but actual reality? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HOOKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronan Fitzpatrick, aka the best hooker the world of rugby has seen in decades, despises the media—social or otherwise. The press has spun a web of lies depicting him as rugby’s wild and reckless bad boy. Suspended from his team, Ronan has come to Manhattan to escape the drama, lay low, fly under the radar. Only, Ronan isn’t easy to overlook, and he can’t escape the notice of the Socialmedialite…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PLAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ronan is sent to Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media to reshape his public image, he never expects to cross paths with shy but beautiful Annie, nor does he expect his fierce attraction to her. He couldn’t be happier when her boss suggests pairing them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lengths will Annie take to keep her virtual identity concealed? And what happens when the hooker discovers who the hermit really is?</description>
