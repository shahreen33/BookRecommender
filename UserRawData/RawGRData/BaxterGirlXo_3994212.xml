  <description>The wily changeling has gotten so deep under my skin that I can’t breathe without feeling her. Her smart mouth is a constant temptation, our salty banter like rough kisses in a darkened room. My thoughts are broken, and I can admit that I’m obsessed. That’s why I’ve been keeping Beth at a distance. I don’t trust myself around her. Not when I can see her wounded soul in her eyes even when she’s laughing. Her flippant words hide a pain that goes so deep I doubt I’ll ever find its bottom. She has lived her life in chains. How can I begin to understand what she’s been through? I want to so badly that it consumes me. I want to hold her, to promise her she is safe in the winter realm with me. But I shouldn’t. I could get so lost in her that I would forsake my fated mate, one I’ve been waiting on for centuries. So, I create a set of rules and stick by them. I avoid her and bury myself in preparations for the winter realm’s new queen. It’s working. . . At least it was until I felt the mate bond snap into place. All my rules splinter when I realize Beth is mine. And when she’s taken from me? I will crush the pillars of Arin to get her back.&lt;br /&gt;Lily's Note: Taken is Book 5 of the Fae's Captive Series and begins Gareth's and Beth's story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Number-one New York Times best-selling author J.R. Ward's thrilling new novel in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payne, twin sister of Vishous, is cut from the same dark, seductive cloth as her brother. Imprisoned for eons by their mother, the Scribe Virgin, she finally frees herself - only to face a devastating injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuel Manello, M.D., is drafted by the Brotherhood to save her as only he can - but when the human surgeon and the vampire warrior meet, their two worlds collide in the face of their undeniable passion. With so much working against them, can love prove stronger than the birthright and the biology that separates them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;18 hours and 37 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Intelligence gathering. Handling jobs the U.S. government can’t...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enigmatic Hancock has been both opponent and ally to the KGI teams for as long as they've known him. Always working a deep game, Hancock's true allegiance has never been apparent, but one thing is for certain—he never lets anything get in the way of duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, his absolute belief in the primacy of his ultimate goal is challenged by a captive he's been ordered to guard, no matter how much she suffers in her prison. She's the only woman who's ever managed to penetrate the rigid walls surrounding his icy heart, but will he allow his perplexing feelings for the beautiful victim to destroy a mission he's spent years working to complete or will he be forced to sacrifice her for “the greater good.”</description>

Her face has graced countless magazines and her body has sold millions of dollars of clothing. But her fame and beauty has earned her more than she ever imagined. Evil is stalking her, determined to extinguish the ethereal beauty forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Swanson or “Swanny” as his teammates call him is always up for the next mission. He came back from Afghanistan wounded and scarred. Hardly the kind of man who even belongs in the same room with Eden. And yet there’s something about the quiet beauty that stirs his blood and makes him dream of the impossible. Because Beauty loving the Beast only happens in fairy tales and KGI doesn’t deal in fairy tales. Ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Kelly Group International (KGI): A super-elite, top secret, family-run business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Qualifications: High intelligence, rock-hard body, military background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mission: Hostage/kidnap victim recovery. Intelligence gathering. Handling jobs the U.S. government can’t… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over the years, Donovan Kelly has fought relentlessly for justice, women and children always holding a special place in his heart. Working side by side with his brothers, Donovan has witnessed firsthand the toll it’s taken—physically, mentally, and emotionally—on his loved ones, and the innocent lives caught in the crossfire. What he never expects is for his next mission to happen right on his home turf—or for it to take a very personal turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Picturesque Kentucky Lake is the perfect place for a soul in search of safe harbor. A beautiful stranger has arrived—desperate, breathless, and on the run from a dark past closing in on her and the younger siblings she has vowed to protect. Donovan must now draw on every resource at his disposal—if he wants to save a woman and the children who may prove to be his destiny.</description>

Intelligence gathering. Handling jobs the U.S. government can’t…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steele, a KGI team leader, is an enigma not even his team mates understand. His emotions are tightly locked down and nothing can break that icy exterior. Nothing except Maren Scofield, a doctor on a mission, a woman who has gotten under Steele’s skin and threatens to crack that unflappable cool he’s legendary for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steele is determined not to allow Maren past his carefully guarded defenses, but when she’s in danger, there’s no way he’ll allow anyone else to protect her. She’s hiding something. He’s sure of it. But he isn’t prepared for the shocking discovery her secrets reveal. Or how they will forever alter the course of his destiny. He has a decision to make. Hold tight and shut her out. Or take a chance on something more powerful than he’s ever faced. Love.</description>

  <description>The Kelly Group International (KGI): A super-elite, top secret, family-run business. Qualifications: High intelligence, rock-hard body, military background. Mission: Hostage/kidnap victim recovery. Intelligence gathering. Handling jobs the U.S. government can’t… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.J. and Cole were sharpshooting rivals on the same KGI team and enjoyed a spirited, uncomplicated camaraderie. Until the night they gave in to their desires and suddenly took their relationship one step further. In the aftermath of their one-night stand, they’re called out on a mission that goes terribly wrong, and P.J. walks away from KGI, resolved not to drag her teammates into the murky shadows she’s poised to delve into. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months later, Cole hasn’t given up his search for P.J., and he’s determined to bring her back home where she belongs. Bent on vengeance, P.J. has plunged into a serpentine game of payback that will make her question everything she’s ever believed in. But Cole—and the rest of their team—refuse to let her go it alone. Even if it means sacrificing their loyalty to KGI, and their lives…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also includes a never-before-in-print KGI novella exclusive to the mass market edition!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Her only lifeline--an unerring telepathic ability she shares with her sister--has been severed, leaving her alone and vulnerable. And time is running out...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Enlisted to bring Grace home is Rio, relentless member of the KGI. He's unprepared for his reaction to this wounded, damaged woman, and he's fiercely determined to protect her from those who nearly destroyed her. In Rio, she finds a safe haven, and for the first time...hope. But the mission is far from over. The danger Grace has eluded is fast closing in. And now it's pitching two lovers toward an unfamiliar horizon, with no place left to hide. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She came to him when he needed her the most&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She came to him at his lowest point. The voice of an angel, a whisper in the dark. She’s the only thing that gets Nathan Kelly through his captivity, the endless days of torture and the fear that he’ll never return to his family. With her help, he’s able to escape. But he isn’t truly free, because now she’s disappeared and he’s left with an all-consuming emptiness as he struggles to pick up the pieces of his life. Did he imagine his angel? Or is she out there, needing his help as he’d once needed hers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now he rushes to save her before it’s too late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea has been on the run from people who will stop at nothing to exploit her unique abilities. She never wanted to drag Nathan, who’d already suffered so much, into danger, but she doesn’t have a choice so she reaches out to him for help. Finally face-to-face after having already formed a soul-deep bond in hell, their emotional connection is even more powerful than their telepathic one. Nathan refuses to consider ever letting her go again, but she worries they can never have a life free of the dangers that dog her every step. He’ll protect her with his every breath, but can he convince her that they are meant to face these threats together?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A man who shoots first and asks questions later…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people would take an all-expenses-paid trip to the beach in a heartbeat. Garrett Kelly only accepts to keep tabs on Sarah Daniels, who’s in hiding after witnessing a murder by Marcus Lattimer, her half-brother—and a personal enemy of KGI. This gig may be beneath a disciplined soldier like Garrett, but if he gets a shot at Lattimer, it will all be worth it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;…and the ultimate moving target.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Garrett hadn’t counted on falling for Sarah. He’d considered seduction as a tactical maneuver, but when he glimpses Sarah’s dark past, he feels an urgent desire to keep her safe—even after she disappears on him. Garrett doesn’t know exactly who, or what, Sarah’s running from, but whatever it is, she’s running for her life…</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sam Kelly was her first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person Sam Kelly expected to pull wounded from the lake was Sophie Lundgren. Once they shared a brief, intense affair while Sam was undercover and then she vanished. She’s spent the last months on the run, knowing that any mistake would cost her life and that of her unborn child—Sam’s child. Now she’s resurfaced with a warning for Sam: this time, he’s the one in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Now he’s her last chance.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam has too many questions to let her slip away again—like why she disappeared in the first place. This time he vows not to be seduced. But one look in her eyes, and the passion burns again, and Sam knows he’ll do anything to keep her and his child safe. However, Sophie’s dark past is more dangerous than he imagines, and the only way for either to survive it is to outrun it.</description>

  <description>It’s been one year since ex-Navy SEAL Ethan Kelly last saw his wife Rachel alive. Overwhelmed by grief and guilt over his failures as a husband, Ethan shuts himself off from everything and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His brothers have tried to bring Ethan into the KGI fold, tried to break through the barriers he’s built around himself, but Ethan refuses to respond… until he receives anonymous information claiming Rachel is alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her, Ethan will have to dodge bullets, cross a jungle, and risk falling captive to a deadly drug cartel that threatens his own demise. And even if he succeeds, he’ll have to force Rachel to recover memories she can’t and doesn’t want to relive—the minute by minute terror of her darkest hour—for their love, and their lives, may depend on it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Danger inspires fierce passion when a serial killer threatens Chicago’s Ferraro crime family in this novel in Christine Feehan’s New York Times bestselling series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vittorio Ferraro is a man whose family loyalty knows no bounds. He would die for his siblings and the people they love, but what he really wants is to start a family of his own. Deep down, Vittorio has always known finding a woman who could ride shadows would be nearly impossible—let alone one who could accept his particular needs—and he never expected to find her in the middle of a kidnapping.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Murphy has always been drawn to Vittorio Ferraro—or at least to the billionaire’s public bad-boy persona. Now that she’s under his protection and the sole focus of his intense caring, she can’t help wanting to get as close to him as possible. But Grace knows her presence is putting the entire Ferraro family in danger. Her monster of a brother will never let her go, but Vittorio has no intention of losing the woman whose shadow matches his own.</description>

But unknown to them--and the women he beds--he's just playing a role. Keeping the spotlight on himself keeps it off the family business. And if this lethal shadow rider can't hunt in the dark, he'll find his pleasure elsewhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasha Provis grew up on a Wyoming ranch and thought she knew how to protect herself from predators.

And his every touch takes her breath away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The devil at her heels may have finally met its match...</description>

  <description>In the venerable history of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, only one male has ever been expelled—but Murhder’s insanity gave the Brothers no choice. Haunted by visions of a female he could not save, he nonetheless returns to Caldwell on a mission to right the wrong that ruined him. However, he is not prepared for what he must face in his quest for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Sarah Watkins, researcher at a biomedical firm, is struggling with the loss of her fellow scientist fiancé. When the FBI starts asking about his death, she questions what really happened and soon learns the terrible truth: Her firm is conducting inhumane experiments in secret and the man she thought she knew and loved was involved in the torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Murhder and Sarah’s destinies become irrevocably entwined, desire ignites between them. But can they forge a future that spans the divide separating the two species? And as a new foe emerges in the war against the vampires, will Murhder return to his Brothers... or resume his lonely existence forevermore?</description>

  <description>Sola Morte, former cat burglar and safecracker, has given up her old life on the wrong side of the law. On the run from a drug lord’s family, she is lying low far from Caldwell, keeping her nose clean and her beloved grandmother safe. Her heart, though, is back up north, with the only man who has ever gotten through her defenses: Assail, son of Assail, who never meant to fall in love—and certainly not with a human woman. But they have no future, and not just because she doesn’t know he is a vampire, but because he is not about to stop dealing arms to the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate, however, has other plans for them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Assail falls into a coma and lingers on the verge of death, his cousins seek out Sola and beg her to give him a reason to live. The last thing she wants is a return to her past, but how can she leave him to die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lethal new enemy of the vampires shows its face, and the Brotherhood needs Assail back on his feet, Sola finds herself not only a target, but a mission-critical force in a war she doesn’t understand. And when Assail’s truth comes out, will she run from the horror... or follow her heart into the arms of the male who loves her more than life itself?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Warren, Nathan, Sloan and the rest of the Soul Summoner crew are back in book 7 of the Soul Summoner series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warren Parish is literally about to go to hell and back to protect his daughter, but first he must save her from an even closer danger—Heaven.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Council of angels has decreed Iliana must be brought to Eden to be made a seraph—an angel frozen as a child. And though it means Warren can finally be with her, she will never grow up. She will never access her power. And she will never have the life he sacrificed everything to give her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Time is running out. He has until her first birthday to bring her to Eden. If not, the guardians will be sent for her, and he will be stripped of his birthright as the Archangel and lose his daughter forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In an exclusive ebook novella set in the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author J. R. Ward tells the story of a fiery couple . . . doomed by an undeniable passion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Features a special preview of J. R. Ward’s upcoming Black Dagger Brotherhood novel, &lt;i&gt;The Thief&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The last place Ivie expects to be approached by a devastatingly handsome male is in a crowded, smoky cigar bar rarely frequented by vampires—yet here he stands. Silas is flirtatious, gallant, and, above all, mysterious. Ivie is anything but. A nurse at the healer’s clinic and the daughter of a biker, Ivie is accustomed to speaking her mind. So she does. Since aristocrats rarely pick up females of her class, Ivie asks Silas just what kind of game he thinks he’s playing.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Despite her guarded exterior, Ivie surrenders to the fierce desire she feels for Silas. And yet, just as their courtship is heating up, he reveals that it cannot last, for he is bound to return to the Old Country. Their bond only deepens as they make the most of their precious time together. But when she learns the truth, Ivie must find a saving grace—before all is lost. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first book in Molly Harper's uproariously funny, sinfully sexy new Mystic Bayou series!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anthropologist Jillian Ramsay's career has taken a turn south. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Concerned that technology is about to chase mythological creatures out into the open (how long can Sasquatch stay hidden from Google maps?), the League for Interspecies Cooperation is sending Jillian to Louisiana on a fact-finding mission. While the League hopes to hold on to secrecy for a little bit longer, they're preparing for the worst in terms of human reactions. They need a plan, so they look to Mystic Bayou, a tiny town hidden in the swamp where humans and supernatural residents have been living in harmony for generations. Mermaids and gator shifters swim in the bayou. Spirit bottles light the front porches after twilight. Dragons light the fires under crayfish pots. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jillian's first assignment for the League could be her last. Mystic Bayou is wary of outsiders, and she has difficulty getting locals to talk to her. And she can't get the gruff town sheriff, Bael Boone, off of her back or out of her mind. Bael is the finest male specimen she's seen in a long time, even though he might not be human. Soon their flirtation is hotter than a dragon's breath, which Bael just might turn out to be... &lt;br /&gt;</description>

As she herself becomes a target, and someone close to the Brotherhood is identified as the prime suspect, the two must work to together to solve the mystery...before it’s too late. Will a madman come between the lovers or will true love and goodness triumph over a very mortal evil?</description>

  <description>The classified experiment is the brainchild of renowned scientist Peter Whitney and his brilliant daughter, Lily. Created to enhance the psychic abilities of an elite squadron, it can transform their natural mental powers into a unique military weapon. But something goes wrong. In the isolated underground labs, the men have been dying-victims of bizarre accidents. Captain Ryland Miller knows he is next. When Dr. Whitney himself is murdered, Ryland has only one person left to trust: the beautiful Lily. Possessed of an uncanny sixth sense herself, Lily shares Ryland's every new fear, every betrayal, every growing suspicion, and every passionate beat of the heart. Together, they will be drawn deeper into the labyrinth of her father's past and closer to a secret that someone would kill to keep hidden.</description>

  <description>The Warlord Wants Forever... the sensually charged novella that started it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this scorching series opener, #1 New York Times bestseller Kresley Cole introduces the captivating Immortals After Dark Series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Warlord&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikolai Wroth, a ruthless vampire general, will stop at nothing to find his Bride, the one woman who can “blood” him, making his heart beat and filling him with strength. Coldly interested only in the power his Bride will bring, he can hardly believe when Myst the Coveted awakens him body—and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Seductress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed throughout the world as the most beautiful Valkyrie, Myst has devoted her life to protecting a magical jewel and to fighting the vampires.Wroth provides her with the perfect opportunity to torment her sworn enemy—for with his new heartbeat comes a consuming sexual desire that can only be slaked by her. Denying him, she flees, struggling to forget his searing, possessive kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hunt is on...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She eludes him for five years, but he has finally chased her to ground and stolen her enchanted jewel, giving him absolute power over her. Now that she’s his for the taking, he intends to make her experience first-hand the agonizing, unending lust she subjected him to for half a decade. Yet when Nikolai realizes he wants far more than vengeance from Myst and frees her, will she come back to him?</description>

  <description>A vampire aristocrat of the Glymera, Peyton is well aware of his duty to his bloodline: mate with an appropriate female of his class and carry on his family’s traditions. And he thought he’d found his perfect match in Paradise—until she fell in love with someone else. When his split-second decision in a battle with the enemy endangers the life of another trainee, Peyton has to face the idea that his future, and his heart, actually lie with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novo, as a female in the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s training program, feels like she has to prove herself to everybody—and she has no interest in being distracted by falling in love. But when Peyton proves to be so much more than a rich playboy, she is forced to confront the tragedy that has broken her soul and closed her off from love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two grapple with Novo’s past and Peyton’s present, another couple must contend with an erotic connection that is unparalleled—and potentially scandalous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saxton, who has had his heart broken, discovers in himself a deep-seated attraction to Ruhn, a new member of the household. But will the other male explore the connection? Or will he close his mind and his heart to what could be true love . . . and cost Saxton everything?</description>

  <description>When Dr. Tara Sims is robbed, she fights back to protect her daughter and nearly pays with her life. She’s rescued by Texas Ranger Grady West. Her childhood friend is now a handsome lawman, but Tara refuses to acknowledge the chemistry sparking between them. With a little girl to raise and a growing medical practice, she has no room in her life for romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grady suspects the vicious assault wasn’t a random act. What he can’t figure out is why anyone would attack the single mother. He vows to protect Tara and her little girl while keeping his growing feelings for them out of the equation. Getting romantically involved with his sister’s best friend is more hazardous than hunting criminals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the threats escalate and evidence links the robbery to a homicide, Tara and Grady realize nothing is quite as it seems. Untangling a web of secrets makes them the target of a madman, and it’s only a matter of time before the killer strikes again…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A scorching forbidden love threatens to tear a rift through the Black Dagger Brotherhood in J. R. Ward’s newest novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Xcor, leader of the Band of Bastards, convicted of treason against the Blind King, is facing a brutal interrogation and torturous death at the hands of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. Yet after a life marked by cruelty and evil deeds, he accepts his soldier’s fate, his sole regret the loss of a sacred female who was never his: the Chosen Layla.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Layla alone knows the truth that will save Xcor’s life. But revealing his sacrifice and his hidden heritage will expose them both and destroy everything Layla holds dear—even her role of mother to her precious young. Torn between love and loyalty, she must summon the courage to stand up against the only family she has for the only man she will ever love. Yet even if Xcor is somehow granted a reprieve, he and Layla would have to confront a graver challenge: bridging the chasm that divides their worlds without paving the way for a future of even greater war, desolation, and death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a dangerous old enemy returns to Caldwell, and the identity of a new deity is revealed, nothing is certain or safe in the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, not even true love . . . or destinies that have long seemed set in stone.</description>

  <description>Along the edges of darkness, a war of attrition rages between the demon plane and the Tehrex Realm. Dark Warriors alone stand between humans and the evil that seeks to destroy them. Zander Tarakesh, the sexy as sin vampire king, leads the battle. Zander is battle-hardened and accustomed to command, yet wrestles to regain control when his Fated Mate is propelled into his world, bombarding him with unfamiliar emotions. His life depends on him uniting with Elsie, the slip of a mortal, who unknowingly protects a vital piece of his soul. Eradicating the demons will be an easier task than combating her sense of guilt and betrayal to gain her acceptance, loyalty, and ultimately her love. And, he must do this before she plunges a stake in his heart. One thing is certain; the flames of passion ignite a fire in their shared souls… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elsie Hayes’ life is shattered after the vicious murder of her husband. Intent on revenge, she spends her evenings killing creatures others only see in nightmares. A supernatural event teleports Elsie into a world filled with violence, magic and unexpected lust and love when she is thrust from widow to Fated Mate of the enigmatic vampire king. Can she lower the protective shield around her heart, giving herself to a vampire whose power is the very reason her life was changed forever? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The Black Dagger Brotherhood continues to train the best of the best to join them in the deadly battle against the Lessening Society. Among the new recruits, Axe proves to be a cunning and vicious fighter—and also a loner isolated because of personal tragedy. When an aristocratic female needs a bodyguard, Axe takes the job, though he’s unprepared for the animal attraction that flares between him and the one he is sworn to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Elise, who lost her first cousin to a grisly murder, Axe’s dangerous appeal is enticing—and possibly a distraction from her grief. But as they delve deeper into her cousin’s death, and their physical connection grows into so much more, Axe fears that the secrets he keeps and his tortured conscience will tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rhage, the Brother with the biggest heart, knows all about self-punishing, and he wants to help Axe reach his full potential. But when an unexpected arrival threatens Rhage and Mary’s new family, he finds himself back in the trenches again, fighting against a destiny that will destroy all he holds most dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Axe’s past becomes known, and fate seems to be turning against Rhage, both males must reach deep—and pray that love, rather than anger, will be their lantern in the darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A snarky fae, a sexy king, and forbidden desire deep as the sea.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, I was a fae princess with sea-magic at my fingertips. Now? I’m a hunted supernatural in a squalid shop, stripped of my power. My only comforts are stale cookies, Elvis records, and my hula-hoop. Until a lethally sexy fae king arrives and rips even those away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the brutal king throws me in prison, I strike a bargain with him: my freedom in exchange for helping him find a magic blade. What Lyr doesn’t know is that the blade might restore my stolen magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as we journey, the gorgeous jerk is starting to make me feel things I’ve never felt. When Lyr touches me, desire ignites. I see raging passion in his eyes, too. If I give in, I risk losing my chance at reclaiming my power. Even worse... I could be forfeiting my life.</description>

Luckily, her best friend Will was always one step ahead of Fate preventing her from being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Will was her knight in shining armor until he broke her heart after their one and only kiss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Lilly’s first day of college, she meets Brand Cole. Intrigued by Brand, Lilly must decide whether or not she can give up her adolescent fantasy of being reunited with Will and allow Brand the opportunity to conqueror her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do Will and Brand both love Lilly, they share a dark secret neither wants Lilly to discover. Lilly thinks Fate is after her once again when a new series of attempts on her life start to take place, but she soon learns someone of flesh and blood is trying to kill her this time.</description>

  <description>Drawing, my online clan, and planning my escape from my mother--these are priorities. Or, at least they were, until three huge alien males came to abduct me and take me to their planet. But it's not just a simple process of probing and then releasing me back to Earth. All those movies are lies. These three males &lt;i&gt;keep&lt;/i&gt; me. And I'm suddenly a cadet at an Omega Academy where I'm supposed to learn how to serve the Gretar Fleet. None of this makes any sense to begin with, nevermind the three males I can't seem to avoid. But they say we have a connection, that we're a circle, whatever that means. And my body seems to agree, because anytime they're near, I can't seem to think of anything except Kyte's horns, Jeren's smirk, and Ceredes's long, hard ... sword. Focusing on class is almost impossible, and the Omega Academy isn't for the faint of heart. I have to learn who my enemies are, how to make friends, and how I fit with the three males I can't stop thinking about. All doable, right? No. Not right, especially when I discover the fleet has other plans for me. The bond with my three males may be the only thing that can keep me safe, but that means we need to consummate our circle. Yeah, you read that right, &lt;i&gt;consummate&lt;/i&gt;. Deep. Breaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily's Note: Omega Academy is a full-length novel and the first book of the Omega Academy trilogy.</description>

  <description>Nothing is as it used to be for the Black Dagger Brotherhood. After avoiding war with the Shadows, alliances have shifted and lines have been drawn. The slayers of the Lessening Society are stronger than ever, preying on human weakness to acquire more money, more weapons, more power. But as the Brotherhood readies for an all-out attack on them, one of their own fights a battle within himself…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Rhage, the Brother with the biggest appetites, but also the biggest heart, life was supposed to be perfect—or at the very least, perfectly enjoyable. Mary, his beloved shellan, is by his side and his King and his brothers are thriving. But Rhage can’t understand—or control—the panic and insecurity that plague him…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that terrifies him—as well as distances him from his mate. After suffering mortal injury in battle, Rhage must reassess his priorities—and the answer, when it comes to him, rocks his world...and Mary’s. But Mary is on a journey of her own, one that will either bring them closer together or cause a split that neither will recover from...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The legacy of the Black Dagger Brotherhood continues in a spin-off series from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Paradise, blooded daughter of the king’s First Advisor, is ready to break free from the restrictive life of an aristocratic female. Her strategy? Join the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s training center program and learn to fight for herself, think for herself...be herself. It’s a good plan, until everything goes wrong. The schooling is unfathomably difficult, the other recruits feel more like enemies than allies, and it’s very clear that the Brother in charge, Butch O’Neal, a.k.a. the &lt;i&gt;Dhestroyer&lt;/i&gt;, is having serious problems in his own life.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; And that’s before she falls in love with a fellow classmate. Craeg, a common civilian, is nothing her father would ever want for her, but everything she could ask for in a male. As an act of violence threatens to tear apart the entire program, and the erotic pull between them grows irresistible, Paradise is tested in ways she never anticipated--and left wondering whether she’s strong enough to claim her own power...on the field, and off.</description>

  <description>Trez “Latimer” doesn’t really exist. And not just because the identity was created so that a Shadow could function in the underbelly of the human world. Sold by his parents to the Queen of the S’Hsibe as a child, Trez escaped the Territory and has been a pimp and an enforcer in Caldwell, NY for years- all the while on the run from a destiny of sexual servitude. He’s never had anyone he could totally rely on... except for his brother, iAm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iAm’s sole goal has always been to keep his brother from self-destructing- and he knows he’s failed. It’s not until the Chosen Serena enters Trez’s life that the male begins to turn things around... but by then it’s too late. The pledge to mate the Queen’s daughter comes due and there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and no negotiating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped between his heart and a fate he never volunteered for, Trez must decide whether to endanger himself and others- or forever leave behind the female he’s in love with. But then an unimaginable tragedy strikes and changes everything. Staring out over an emotional abyss, Trez must find a reason to go on or risk losing himself and his soul forever. And iAm, in the name of brotherly love, is faced with making the ultimate sacrifice...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Long live the King... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his father’s mantle—with the help of his beloved mate. But the crown sets heavily on his head. As the war with the Lessening Society rages on, and the threat from the Band of Bastards truly hits home, he is forced to make choices that put everything—and everyone—at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Randall thought she knew what she was getting into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it. But when she decides she wants a child, she’s unprepared for Wrath’s response—or the distance it creates between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, will true love win out... or tortured legacy take over?</description>

  <description>Redemption isn’t a word Jim Heron knows much about—his specialty, both personally and professionally, is revenge, and to him, sin is all relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vincent Di Pietro has surrendered himself to his business—until fate intervenes in the form of a tough-talking, Harley-riding, self-professed savior, and a woman who will make him question his destiny.</description>

  <description>Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has finally found an identity as one of the most brutal fighters in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems to be within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it’s about time: it seems Qhuinn has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young. It’s hard for Blay to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. And Qhuinn needs to come to terms with some dark things before he can move forward…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions... but as the battle over the race’s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn finally learns the true definition of courage, and two hearts who are meant to be together... finally become one.</description>

  <description>Ever since the death of his &lt;i&gt;shellan&lt;/i&gt;, Tohrment has been unrecognizable from the vampire leader he once was. Physically emaciated and heartbroken beyond despair, he has been brought back to the Brotherhood by a self-serving fallen angel. Now, fighting once again with ruthless vengeance, he is unprepared to face a new kind of tragedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tohr begins to see his beloved in his dreams—trapped in a cold, isolated netherworld far from the peace and tranquillity of the Fade—he turns to the angel in hopes of saving the one he has lost. But because Lassiter tells him he must learn to love another to free his former mate, Tohr knows they are all doomed.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except then a female with a shadowed history begins to get through to him. Against the backdrop of the raging war with the &lt;i&gt;lessers&lt;/i&gt;, and with a new clan of vampires vying for the Blind King’s throne, Tohr struggles between the buried past and a very hot, passion-filled future…but can his heart let go and set all of them free?</description>

  <description>John Matthew has come a long way since he was found living among humans, his vampire nature unknown to himself and to those around him. After he was taken in by the Brotherhood, no one could guess what his true history was- or his true identity. Indeed, the fallen Brother Darius has returned, but with a different face and a very different destiny. As a vicious personal vendetta takes John into the heart of the war, he will need to call up on both who he is now and who he once was in order to face off against evil incarnate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xhex, a symphath assassin, has long steeled herself against the attraction between her and John Matthew. Having already lost one lover to madness, she will not allow the male of worth to fall prey to the darkness of her twisted life. When fate intervenes, however, the two discover that love, like destiny, is inevitable between soul mates.</description>

  <description>Rehvenge has always kept his distance from the Brotherhood—even though his sister is married to a member, for he harbors a deadly secret that could make him a huge liability in their war against the lessers. As plots within and outside of the Brotherhood threaten to reveal the truth about Rehvenge, he turns to the only source of light in his darkening world, Ehlena, a vampire untouched by the corruption that has its hold on him—and the only thing standing between him and eternal destruction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In this "frighteningly addictive" paranormal romance saga there's a war raging between vampires and their slayers. Here are the stories of a secret band of brothers like no other—six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. And now a dutiful twin must choose between two lives...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal to the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Phury has sacrificed himself for the good of the race, becoming the male responsible for keeping the Brotherhood's bloodlines alive. As Primale of the Chosen, he is obligated to father the sons and daughters who will ensure that the traditions of the race survive, and that there are warriors to fight those who want all vampires extinguished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his first mate, the Chosen Cormia wants to win not only his body, but his heart for herself. She is drawn to the noble responsibility behind the emotionally scarred male. But Phury has never allowed himself to know pleasure or joy. As the war with the Lessening Society grows grim, tragedy looms over the Brotherhood's mansion, and Phury must decide between duty and love....</description>

  <description>Butch O'Neal is a fighter by nature. A hard-living ex-homicide cop, he's the only human ever to be allowed in the inner circle of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. And he wants to go even deeper into the vampire world—to engage in the turf war with the lessers. He's got nothing to lose. His heart belongs to a female vampire, an aristocratic beauty who's way out of his league. If he can't have Marissa, then at least he can fight side by side with the Brothers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate curses him with the very thing he wants. When Butch sacrifices himself to save a civilian vampire from the slayers, he falls prey to the darkest force in the war. Left for dead, he's found by a miracle, and the Brotherhood calls on Marissa to bring him back. But even her love may not be enough to save him...</description>

  <description>In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there’s a deadly war raging between vampires and their slayers. And there exists a secret band of brothers like no other - six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Of these, Zsadist is the most terrifying member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former blood slave, the vampire Zsadist still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation. Renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, he is a savage feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful aristocrat from the evil Lessening Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. But even as their desire for one another begins to overtake them both, Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness. Now, Bella must help her lover overcome the wounds of his tortured past, and find a future with her…</description>

  <description>Possessed of an extraordinary telekinetic gift, Dahlia Le Blanc has spent her life isolated from other people. And just when she thinks she's finally achieved some semblance of peace, her well-orchestrated world comes crashing down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a reason she cannot guess, she has become the target of deadly assassins. Suddenly no place is safe--not even the secret refuge she'd established long ago. Now she must rely on Nicolas Trevane--a dangerous warrior sent to track her down and protect her. Together they generate a scorching heat Dahlia never imagined was possible. But can she trust this man with her secrets--especially when some people would kill to get their hands on them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war raging between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Possessed by a deadly beast, Rhage is the most dangerous of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the brotherhood, Rhage is the vampire with the strongest appetites. He's the best fighter, the quickest to act on his impulses, and the most voracious lover-for inside him burns a ferocious curse cast by the Scribe Virgin. Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves...</description>

He’ll do whatever it takes to make Breezy his woman again—especially when he learns the real reason she came to him for help, and that the stakes are higher than he ever could have imagined…</description>

  <description>The classified experiment is the brainchild of renowned scientist Peter Whitney and his brilliant daughter, Lily. Created to enhance the psychic abilities of an elite squadron, it can transform their natural mental powers into a unique military weapon. But something goes wrong. In the isolated underground labs, the men have been dying-victims of bizarre accidents. Captain Ryland Miller knows he is next. When Dr. Whitney himself is murdered, Ryland has only one person left to trust: the beautiful Lily. Possessed of an uncanny sixth sense herself, Lily shares Ryland's every new fear, every betrayal, every growing suspicion, and every passionate beat of the heart. Together, they will be drawn deeper into the labyrinth of her father's past and closer to a secret that someone would kill to keep hidden.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Betrayal has taken Taylor far beyond my reach.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can feel the bond stretched and twisted until it’s on the verge of snapping. But I will find her. She is mine as I am hers, and nothing will stop me from recovering my queen. I will always come for her. If she is hurt, I will heal her. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If she is scared, I will wrap my arms around her, my embrace her safe harbor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;And as for the ones who took her?&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will destroy them all. Crossing the frozen heart of winter will be their final mistake. My fury will end the king beyond the mountain, and I will return to the winter realm with my queen by my side. A solid plan. One that would have worked. But when I reach the Gray Mountains, nothing is as it seems, and my mate faces a danger from the most insidious of foes - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;herself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You’ll have to read that for yourself. But all in all. It was a good book.<br /><br />I can’t wait to read Gareth and Beth story.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fresh beginning. A new threat. A Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth is finally safe, tucked away in the lair of her four dragon protectors. Now, she must learn to cope with the grief of losing her parents, her home, and the Southeastern White Tooth Pack, including a wolf her heart still yearns for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her four dragon protectors might keep their distance while she mourns, but they make it clear they desire her completely. Body, heart and soul. Despite her grief and the guilt clawing at her heart, Elizabeth’s feelings for the four men grow. She can see the future they are offering her. A fresh start... with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But a new challenge arises when the Shifter Authority forbids their relationship. The Authority claims wolves can’t mate with dragons, and certainly can’t conceive dragon babies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Refusing to give Elizabeth up, each man is prepared to fight any battle to keep her and to prove that she’s their fated mate. They embark on a quest to find a legendary dragon. The dragon is rumored to have defied the orders of the authority, mated with a wolf and sired dragon children. If Elizabeth and her men can find this elusive dragon and his family, they can prove that they are meant to be. That their union will bring about the birth of dragon children. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The journey is fraught with danger and Elizabeth must learn to trust her dragons. Her life depends on it. &lt;br /&gt;That may not be the only thing that needs guarding around four passionate and possessive dragon-shifters though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth’s bruised and battered heart may be in the most danger of all… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Elizabeth and the Call of Dragons is Book Two of the Fated Alpha Series. Each book features a paranormal romance, a true reverse harem with one woman and four sexy, demanding and protective dragon shifters. There is no crossing swords in this reverse harem.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buy now to dive into this sexy reverse harem world!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A female Wolf in danger. Four Sexy Dragons determined to protect her. A Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth is certain she’s not meant to rule the Southeastern White Tooth Pack. Since birth, she’s been told she was the wolf pack’s fated leader. She is, after all, the first-born of the pack Alpha. But how can she lead them if she’s never shifted? She doubts herself, but her fate is tied to the moon and Elizabeth is honor-bound to fulfill her destiny. To help Elizabeth, her mother presents her with a secret diamond necklace, magical jewels that have adorned the neck of every female in her family for hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But evil forces lurk in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;Not every wolf shifter in the pack wants Elizabeth to take power. When the Wolf Council sanctions Elizabeth as the official Fated Alpha, enemies attack her family, killing her parents. When they discover that Elizabeth survived, she must flee for her life. With nowhere to go, help comes in the form of four sexy and powerful Dragon shifters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fierce warriors offer her their protection in their secluded mountain home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As Elizabeth mends, it’s clear the four Dragon shifters crave more from her. All four men desire her. Each wants to claim her body and heart and soul.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As her enemies close in, can the men keep Elizabeth safe by their side and help her reclaim her place as leader of her pack?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Elizabeth and the Clan of Dragons is Book One of the Fated Alpha Series. Each book features a paranormal romance, a true reverse harem with one woman and four sexy, demanding and protective shifters.

There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.</description>

  <description>When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how "really, really big" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, "Heaven is for Real" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, "Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Heaven is for Real" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;USA Today bestselling author Nalini Singh introduces a world of beauty and bloodlust, where angels hold sway over vampires…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux knows she’s the best—but she doesn’t know if she’s good enough for this job. Hired by the dangerously beautiful Archangel Raphael, a being so lethal that no mortal wants his attention, only one thing is clear—failure is not an option…even if the task is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this time, it’s not a wayward vamp she has to track. It’s an archangel gone bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job will put Elena in the midst of a killing spree like no other…and pull her to the razor’s edge of passion. Even if the hunt doesn’t destroy her, succumbing to Raphael’s seductive touch just may. For when archangels play, mortals break…</description>

  <description>Living in peaceful Shady Vale, Shea Ohmsford knew little of the troubles that plagued the rest of the world. Then the giant, forbidding Allanon revaled that the supposedly dead Warlock Lord was plotting to destroy the world. The sole weapon against this Power of Darkness was the Sword of Shannara, which could only be used by a true heir of Shannara--Shea being the last of the bloodline, upon whom all hope rested. Soon a Skull Bearer, dread minion of Evil, flew into the Vale, seeking to destroy Shea. To save the Vale, Shea fled, drawing the Skull Bearer after him....</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Red Plains are hot.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;But my fae king?&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Even hotter.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we kind of got captured by a warlike clan of Vundi warriors. Sounds bad, right? But they treat us as guests, and I’m coming to like them despite the ongoing threat of me being shipped off to the king beyond the mountain. I still endeavour to reach the winter kingdom and find a way back home… until the Vundi high priestess reveals that I may have more ties to the fae world than I ever imagined. On top of that, Leander knows just what buttons to press to get me naked, in a tub, and panting for him. My resolve is failing on all fronts. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;But, worse than that, I discover danger is even closer than I realised...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Manu fights against the Gloom for Atlantis. As the general’s son, he carries the weight of a thousand expectations on his shoulders. When a priest of the ocean goddess divines their princess survived the ambush that killed her parents, no one but Manu is more qualified to retrieve her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two decades after she was found on a beach, Kailani has dedicated her life to ocean conservation. Her early childhood may be a mystery, but discovering she's a lost princess sounds like a lunatic’s fairy tale. She’d rather stay on the surface. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The attraction between them is instant and powerful, but she was born to lead and he was bred for battle. If either world is to survive the war ahead, Kailani must fulfill her destiny and become the queen Atlantis needs before evil plunges the entire kingdom into everlasting darkness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to Atlantis is an adult romance. Profanity and adult situations included. This is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a clean read.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fae king is growing on me. Every touch, look, and night spent in his arms is slowly melting my resistance. When his feral side takes over, something inside me wants to let go and give him everything. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;With each passing day, the pull is getting harder to deny...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, the road to the winter realm is full of danger. And, I need to concentrate on finding my way home, not on the promises of pleasure Leander whispers in my ear at night. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even so, how long can I resist the intoxicating kiss of winter?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My college roommate is the worst. Cecile steals my food, brings guys over at all hours, and parties instead of studying. But those quirks pale in comparison to what she does next. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;She drugs me, and I wake up imprisoned in an alternate universe full of terrifying creatures.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, the biggest and scariest creature of all - a fae king - believes I'm his mate. He's freed me from the dungeon, but, keeps me close. So close, in fact, that I'm beginning to like his wintery gaze and ice-chiselled body. But, secrets and villains lurk throughout this new world. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And I don't know if I'll survive long enough to figure out how to get back home.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Much-loved storyteller Karen Kingsbury’s Baxter Family books have captured the hearts of millions who have come to think of the Baxter family as their own. Now Karen Kingsbury and her son Tyler Russell tell the childhood stories of the beloved Baxter children—Brooke, Kari, Ashley, Erin, and Luke—to inspire and entertain younger readers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke is the perfect older sister. For that reason, Kari and Ashley work hard to make their parents just as proud of them as they are of Brooke. Each girl has her own talents. Brooke is an excellent student. Kari is a great soccer player. Ashley, a talented artist. And they are always there for each other. But when the news comes that Dr. Baxter is moving the family from Ann Arbor to Bloomington, Indiana, and the Baxters need to leave the only home and friends they’ve ever known, no one is happy. Saying goodbye is hard but the family still has what’s most important—their faith and their love for each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first book in the Baxter Family Children series, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Kingsbury and Tyler Russell tell the story of what it was like to grow up in the Baxter family, the best family ever.</description>

  <description>"Hello, Praea." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's only one being on Earth who calls Sloan Jordan by that name—her biological mother, a demon named Kasyade. So why did she answer Sloan’s best friend’s phone? When Sloan reaches Adrianne Marx’s apartment to investigate, all she finds is a half-written list of things to do before Sloan’s wedding: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Order booze for the reception.  &lt;br /&gt;2. Send the final guest count to the caterer.  &lt;br /&gt;3. Register for gifts.  &lt;br /&gt;4. Don’t forget to— &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's where the to-do list ended. Mid-sentence with a scrawled line like Adrianne had been dragged away from the task. If Kasyade was involved in the abduction, Adrianne probably had been. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason? Ransom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price? Sloan’s unborn daughter, the most powerful angel in all of history. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But hell can’t rival the fury of an angry mother protecting her child, and until the baby is born, her incredible power is Sloan’s to wield. Now the prey becomes the predator as Sloan seeks to put an end to Kasyade forever.</description>

  <description>Once, they were Navy SEALS. Now they are the Alpha Pack: a top secret team of wolf shifters with Psy powers who take on the darkest dangers on Earth. But sometimes the greatest danger lies within their own hearts....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healer and black wolf shifter Zander Cole has survived horrors that would have broken a weaker man. But when a battle leaves him deaf and his powers dimmed, Zan is devastated. Believing himself to be a burden to his team, he sees only one option: leave the Pack forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White wolf shifter Selene Westfall knows pain—she is certain her father was responsible for her mother’s death. And she lives to exact revenge. So when she is challenged by a savage black wolf, she puts up a vicious fight—only to become the black wolf’s Bondmate as a result of his bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two damaged souls—one filled with hatred and one who’s lost his reason for living—are forced together as they come to terms with their unlikely, turbulent bond. A love neither expected may be all that stands between them and a killer trying desperately to keep the past dead and buried....</description>

  <description>A group of former Navy SEALS, the Alpha Pack is a top secret team of wolf shifters with Psy powers combating the greatest dangers in the world. And when the battle gets personal, their wild side is unleashed….&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryon Hunter sees dead people—spirits that beg him for help in ways he can’t understand. He’d do anything to end the torment, until a beautiful spirit appears to him with a plea he can’t ignore: Help me…I’m alive. The woman is wildlife biologist Daria Bradford, mortally wounded after encountering a white wolf, calling to Ryon through a rare Psy gift.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Ryon locates Daria in the Shoshone National Park, it is almost too late, but nursing her back to health at the Alpha Pack compound brings a new complication—Daria is his destined mate, and Ryon is afraid of what will happen when she discovers what he is, and what he had to do to save her life. But the biggest threat of all is still loose in the forest, leaving a merciless trail of death behind it. The Alpha Pack goes on the hunt for the mysterious white wolf, determined to stop the murderous rogue… only to find that the most lethal creature of all is the one they can’t see coming…</description>

  <description>A group of former Navy SEALS, the Alpha Pack is a top-secret team of wolf shifters with Psy powers combating the greatest dangers in the world. But sometime those dangers are more intimate than they bargained for…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a mission goes wrong, Aric Savage is taken prisoner. Half-dead and despairing, he makes a stunning discovery: his Pack mate Micah Chase, who was reported dead, is a fellow captive. When the Alpha team goes into full-rescue mode, accompanying them is an absolute stunner with sable hair—and a spine of solid steel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LAPD officer and Psy Dreamwalker Rowan Chase has one priority: her brother Micah’s recovery. Still, she can’t help but be drawn to Aric, the ruggedly handsome wolf shifter who pleasures her as no man ever has—however fleeting their affair is destined to be. But when Aric’s life is endangered, Rowan must ask herself what she’s willing to sacrifice in the name of love, for the man fated to be her Bondmate.</description>

  <description>Founded by a group of former Navy SEALS, the Alpha Pack is a top-secret team of wolf shifters with Psy powers tasked with eliminating the most dangerous predators in the world. But the gift of their abilities comes at a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a massacre decimates half his team and leaves him crippled, Jaxon Law must relearn how to fight—and battle the anger and guilt threatening to overwhelm him. But when he rescues a beautiful woman who reawakens his primal instincts, Jax is unprepared for the dangers that lie ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the run from her employer, brilliant lab assistant Kira Locke has evidence that leads the Alpha Pack on a hunt for someone targeting human civilians with Psy abilities. And as Jax and Kira circle both the killer and each other, Jax will have to decide if the deep connection he feels with Kira is worth breaking the ultimate shifter rule—because bonding with Kira means putting his abilities at risk, and they might be the only tools he has to keep his mate alive…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A top secret team of wolf shifters, the Alpha Pack are former Navy SEALS that use their Psy powers to take on the world’s greatest predators. But while each member is loyal to the pack, it can be hard to deny the call of desire…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still tormented by his recent captivity, Alpha Pack commander Nick Westfall isn’t sure he’s fit to lead—especially when he meets the one woman he can’t claim without reliving the torture he endured at the hands of a rogue vampire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire princess Calla Shaw has seen her own share of heartbreak, but she can tell that the wild attraction she and Nick feel for each other could turn into something significant—if only he’d let it. But Calla isn’t about to give up on her mate without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is running out, not only for Nick to claim his mate, but for Calla and her coven. A vampire war is on the horizon, one the Alpha Pack can’t hope to win if their leader can’t pull himself back from the abyss… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon brings us back to the astonishing world of the Dark-Hunters in &lt;i&gt;Battle Born&lt;/i&gt;, with a hero misunderstood by many…but most of all by himself.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born before man recorded time, I lived for thousands of years believing myself to be something I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lied to and betrayed by gods, Daimons and Dark-Hunters, I’ve struggled to find my way in a world where I’ve been cursed since the moment I was prematurely ripped from my mother and planted into the womb of an innocent woman who thought me her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trained as a slayer and predator, I learned to fit in and stay low. To become a tool for evil. Until I was sent to kill the one woman I couldn’t. My hesitation cost her her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought. In an act of betrayal that makes all the others pale in comparison, I’ve learned that this world is an illusion and that my Phoebe still lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I will have to travel into the very pits of Hades to try and save her, even as everyone around me attempts to steal what little soul I have left. There’s only one person at my back and I’m not sure I can trust her either, for she was born of an enemy race. Yet sometimes the road to redemption is one that singes us to our very core. And if I fail to find the answers I need to save Phoebe, more than just my wife will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will lose the world. Both human and Daimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>An angel finds passion and danger in the arms of an unexpected lover in Nalini Singh’s New York Times bestselling series that “may do for angels what [Christine] Feehan did for vampires” (Dear Author)… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentle teacher of angelic young, and the keeper of her people’s histories, Jessamy is respected and admired by everyone who knows her. Yet, born unable to soar into flight, she has spent thousands of years trapped in the mountain stronghold of the Refuge, her heart encased in painful loneliness…until the arrival of Galen, warrior angel from a martial court. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough-edged and blunt, Galen is a weapons-master at home with violence, a stranger to the sweet words it takes to woo a woman—but he is also a man determined to claim Jessamy for his own, to dance with her through the skies denied her for so very long…even if their exhilarating passion proves as dangerous as the landscape of war and unrest that lies before them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angels’ Dance previously appeared in the anthology, Angels’ Flight .</description>

  <description>First-century Corinth is a city teeming with commerce and charm. It’s also filled with danger and corruption—the perfect setting for Ariadne’s greatest adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years spent living with her mother and oppressive grandfather in Athens, Ariadne runs away to her father’s home in Corinth, only to discover the perilous secret that destroyed his marriage: though a Greek of high birth, Galenos is the infamous thief who has been robbing the city’s corrupt of their ill-gotten gains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to keep him safe, Ariadne risks her good name, her freedom, and the love of the man she adores to become her father’s apprentice. As her unusual athletic ability leads her into dangerous exploits, Ariadne discovers that she secretly revels in playing with fire. But when the wrong person discovers their secret, Ariadne and her father find their future—and very lives—hanging in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they befriend a Jewish rabbi named Paul, they realize that his radical message challenges everything they’ve fought to build, yet offers something neither dared hope for.</description>

  <description>Held captive in the barbarian kingdom of Venda, Lia and Rafe have little chance of escape . . . and even less of being together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to save her life, Lia’s erstwhile assassin, Kaden, has told the Vendan Komisar that she has a magical gift, and the Komisar's interest in Lia is greater than either Kaden or Lia foresaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the foundations of Lia's deeply-held beliefs are crumbling beneath her. Nothing is straightforward: there's Rafe, who lied to her, but has sacrificed his freedom to protect her; Kaden, who meant to assassinate her but has now saved her life; and the Vendans, whom she always believed to be barbarians but whom she now realizes are people who have been terribly brutalized by the kingdoms of Dalbreck and Morrighan. Wrestling with her upbringing, her gift, and her very sense of self, Lia will have to make powerful choices that affect her country, her people . . . and her own destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Black Dog&lt;/i&gt;, Book 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tentative peace established in Faerie, Thierry returns to her job as a conclave marshal in Texas while the countdown to her coronation begins. But what happens in Faerie doesn't always stay in Faerie. A crown wasn't Theirry's only souvenir from her trip. Her new husband, Rook, is scheming again, and this time his plans are invading her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend throws a beachside going away party, Thierry is grateful for the distraction from Rook...and from Shaw. But her presence in Daytona rouses an old evil, one who wants the future queen as the crown jewel of his private collection.</description>

  <description>Harlow Bevans was a changeling mermaid working as a diving consultant for the Earthen Conclave. Then he came along. Charybdis. A serial killer who possessed her body and wrecked her mind. Now she's an inmate—patient—at Edelweiss Mental Institution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a haunting song lures her to the scene of a brutal murder, the calm of the past few months is shattered. A fellow patient is dead, and Harlow is caught standing over his body by a mysterious guard who hides his own secrets behind a pair of aviator sunglasses her fingers itch to remove. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unwilling to be a pawn in another psychopath's game, Harlow sets out to discover the real killer. What she uncovers makes her a prime target, and the next song she hears could be her last. Curiosity may not have killed the cat, but it just might fillet the mermaid. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Gemini, Book 2&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Camille Ellis has tracked many killers during her career,but this time it's personal. Cut off from conclave resources, she won't let a small thing like a suspension keep her from accepting Cord Graeson's offer of help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretending to be mated to him is one way to secure allies, but the best that can be said of the Chandler Pack is they haven't killed or eaten her. Yet. Between the alpha's displeasure and the pack's distrust of fae, she's working overtime to keep her head above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when the fur starts to fly, a tip cracks her case--and her life--wide open.&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Camille Ellis is the Earthen Conclave’s golden girl. Her peculiar talent solves cases with a touch. She isn’t afraid of getting her hands dirty, but every bright star casts a shadow, and her deepest scars lurk just beneath the skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A routine consultation goes sideways when a victim’s brother gets involved in the investigation. Riding the edge of grief, the warg will go to any lengths to avenge his sister’s death. Even if it means ensuring Cam’s cooperation at the jaws of his wolf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the killer strikes again, Cam is caught between a warg and a hard place. To save the next victim, she must embrace her past. Even if it means dragging her darkest secrets into the light of day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This series is a spinoff of the author's "Black Dog" series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Gemini, Book 3 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Camille Ellis has gone rogue agent, and there’s no turning back now. The conclave might have put the Charybdis case to bed, but Cam isn’t willing to let it lie. No badge doesn’t mean no backup these days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As mate to an alpha warg, she has access to new and lethal resources. A whole pack full of them. And they all want justice for the sins committed against them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the stakes are higher than she knows, the secrets exposed darker than she feared, and the cost of winning higher than she ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dell has persuaded the Bloodless army to fight alongside her pack in Butler, but she still has to get there. Halfway home, the rift detonates, blasting out a magic surge that sweeps across the globe, frying electronics and spells alike. Leaving her with no way to get home except on her own two--or four--feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous times demand equally lethal alliances, and she has to make a risky deal if she wants to reach the front lines before it's too late. The bargain grants an ancient fae power over her, a hold she vowed no man would ever have on her again, but freedom requires sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the threshold between Earth and Faerie erodes, humans and supernaturals alike are in danger of being erased as the fae seek to claim this world as their own. This is the moment when new legends arise and old gods fall, when fates unspool and futures unravel, when battles are won and lives are lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war isn't just coming. It's here.</description>

  <description>Lorimar Pack, Book 2 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prison is no one's idea of a good time, and it's even worse for Dell. Confinement has her inner wolf snarling as she paces their cell, and there's no end in sight. Just as she reaches her breaking point, the pack liaison shows up with an offer she can’t refuse. Dell’s freedom in exchange for going to Faerie and recapturing the fae prince responsible for her current digs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this fool's errand won't be a solo mission. Isaac Cahill has lost Dell twice, and he’ll be damned if she slips through his fingers again. This time, he’s not letting her out of his sight. Even if it means earning more than a few love bites from his pissed off she-wolf. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What they discover on their perilous quest is that war is closer than anyone imagined. As trusted allies fall and dangerous new threats emerge, Dell discovers one defining truth. Isaac is hers, and she'll fight to the death for him. And, at the rate this war is coming, she might not have long to wait. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lorimar Pack, Book 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is a constant threat on Dell Preston's horizon. As beta of the Lorimar pack, her job is to maintain the peace on the new border between Faerie and Earth at all costs. Even if that means playing nice with her ex, Isaac, the fae who savaged her wolf's soul, and Enzo Garza, the flirty witch who ought to be focused on building up their magical defenses instead of tearing down the walls around Dell's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butler, Tennessee is a pinprick on the map with a diverse population of supernaturals. It's also chockful of humans who are unaware of the magical rift bruising the sky or the otherworldly insurgents raining down into their zipcode. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A local fae's disappearance catches Dell's attention, but she dismisses it as an isolated event. Until it happens again. Unable to ignore the strange happenings in her town, she begins an investigation that uncovers so much more than a simple rash of kidnappings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Dell finds herself at the sharp end of a pointed ultimatum. Find the missing and return them to their families or get ready for prime time. Botch this job, and forget &lt;i&gt;coming soon&lt;/i&gt;. The war will become tomorrow's featured attraction instead.</description>

  <description>After stopping a serial killer and shutting down an interstate human trafficking ring, Sloan Jordan is ready for a break. But back at home in Asheville, her problems have only just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supernatural world has taken an interest in her, and strange things are happening. Her powers are multiplying, she’s plagued by vivid nightmares, and a deranged young woman, babbling an unknown language, has been detained by police. The only clue to her identity—Sloan’s name carved into her arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn't enough, the FBI has launched a full-scale investigation into her private life, believing Sloan might not be as innocent as she claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her boyfriend, Warren Parish, deployed with the Marine Corps, Sloan is left in the protection of Detective Nathan McNamara. And their complicated friendship is about to be tested. Sloan has a secret…one that could turn even Nathan against her forever.</description>

  <description>All the missing victims of North Carolina’s deadliest serial killer have been found, all except Rachel Smith. When the FBI produces a photo proving Rachel is alive and well in Texas, one case is closed but another one is opened. Either this is a case of mistaken identity or there are more people than just Sloan Jordan and Warren Parish who seem to walk the earth without a soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with Detective Nathan McNamara, Sloan and Warren travel south to find Rachel and solve the biggest mystery of all: determining who—or what—they really are.</description>

  <description>Blessed–or cursed–with a connection to the souls of others, Sloan Jordan can see the best in people… and the worst. For twenty-seven years, she's kept her ability a secret, but eleven young women have been murdered in the mountains of North Carolina, and Sloan may be the only hope of finding their killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has just agreed to help Detective Nathan McNamara with the case, when a stranger—who is as alluring as he is terrifying—shows up at her doorstep with a dark past and another puzzling mystery: she can't see his soul at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sloan is on the hunt for a deadly psychopath with two irresistible men. One of them would die for her, and the other would kill to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27304591-the-soul-summoner" rel="nofollow"&gt;B015ZS7DSS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>With eleven missing women to find and six high-profile burglary cases to solve, the last thing Detective Nathan McNamara needs in his life is one more complication. And that’s exactly what his recent one-night stand is becoming — complicated. With his heinous lieutenant breathing down his neck for answers and his accidental girlfriend dropping hints for a commitment, Nathan is realizing that his career and his bachelor status are both on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the burglary cases suddenly escalate to homicide, Nathan must put everything else aside to stop the killer. But this is easier said than done when the blonde from the bar repeatedly shows up at his doorstep and enlists his own mother against him. Now he’s more convinced than ever that his job hangs in the balance and that the Surgeon General’s warning on the whiskey bottle should include something about women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27774235-the-detective" rel="nofollow"&gt;B017DSORBE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Half-bloods with Thierry’s skill set are given two options. They can join the conclave’s marshal program, or they can pack their bags. Turn down the job offer, and you’ve just shredded your residency pass for the mortal realm and booked yourself a one-way ticket to Faerie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is the only home Thierry has ever known, and she’s not going anywhere. Even if it means following in her notorious father’s footsteps as a peacekeeper. But pinning on the badge opens her eyes to the fact sometimes fae need protection too, and that sometimes humans are the real monsters.</description>

  <description>Faerie teeters on the brink of war and the mortal realm swells with fae refugees desperate to escape the bloodshed. As a half-blooded fae, Marshal Thierry Thackeray has a stake in the outcome of both realms and isn’t afraid to knock a few heads together if it keeps the peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her father goes missing, the only hope of negotiating a truce between the light and dark fae vanishes with him. Eager to avoid another Thousand Years War, the Faerie High Court reaches out to the one person they believe can track him down—the daughter who shares his curse.</description>

  <description>Two of you exist. Only one will survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city of Kersh is a safe haven, but the price of safety is high. Everyone has a genetic Alternate—a twin raised by another family—and citizens must prove their worth by eliminating their Alts before their twentieth birthday. Survival means advanced schooling, a good job, marriage—life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old West Grayer has trained as a fighter, preparing for the day when her assignment arrives and she will have one month to hunt down and kill her Alt. But then a tragic misstep shakes West’s confidence. Stricken with grief and guilt, she’s no longer certain that she’s the best version of herself, the version worthy of a future. If she is to have any chance of winning, she must stop running not only from her Alt, but also from love . . . though both have the power to destroy her.</description>

Terrorists are kidnapping biologists and he and his partner have to stop them. But his new partner is a beautiful, sexy woman who looks like she couldn't hurt a fly-never mind take down a terrorist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She's Not Your Average Covert Operative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy Halliwell is no kitten. She's a feline shifter, and more dangerous than she looks. She's worked with a string of hotheaded military guys who've underestimated her special skills in the past. But when she's partnered with special agent Donovan, a man sexy enough to make any girl purr, things begin to heat up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X-Ops Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her Perfect Mate (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt;Her Lone Wolf (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt;Her Secret Agent (novella)&lt;br /&gt;Her Wild Hero (Book 3)&lt;br /&gt;Her Fierce Warrior (Book 4)&lt;br /&gt;Her Rogue Alpha (Book 5)&lt;br /&gt;Her True Match (coming March 2017)</description>

  <description>In a society steeped in tradition, Princess Lia’s life follows a preordained course. As First Daughter, she is expected to have the revered gift of sight—but she doesn’t—and she knows her parents are perpetrating a sham when they arrange her marriage to secure an alliance with a neighboring kingdom—to a prince she has never met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of her wedding, Lia flees to a distant village. She settles into a new life, hopeful when two mysterious and handsome strangers arrive—and unaware that one is the jilted prince and the other an assassin sent to kill her. Deception abounds, and Lia finds herself on the brink of unlocking perilous secrets—even as she finds herself falling in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kiss of Deception &lt;/i&gt;is the first audiobook in Mary E. Pearson's Remnant Chronicles</description>

  <description>Billionaire Ian Shaw can have everything he wants--except a happy ending. Or at least that's what it feels like with his fortune recently liquidated, his niece, Esme, still missing, and the woman he loves refusing to speak to him. In fact, he doubts she would date him even if they were stranded on a deserted island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her love for Ian, Sierra Rose knows he has no room in his life for her as long as the mystery of his missing niece goes unsolved. The only problem is, Sierra &lt;i&gt;has &lt;/i&gt;solved it, but a promise to Esme to keep her whereabouts secret has made it impossible to be around Ian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the PEAK chopper is damaged and Sierra lacks the funds to repair it, Ian offers a fundraising junket for large donors on his yacht in the Caribbean. But the three-day excursion turns into a nightmare when a rogue wave cripples the yacht and sends the passengers overboard. Shaken up and soaked to the bone, Ian finally has a chance to test his theory when he and Sierra do indeed find themselves washed up on a strange, empty shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take guts and gumption for the PEAK team to rescue the duo. But it will take a miracle to rescue Ian and Sierra's relationship.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Casey is hiding again—in Memphis this time—but it’s different now. She knows without a doubt that Dylan believes her and is doing all he can to help bring Brent’s killer to justice. He’s become an unexpected friend . . . and even, maybe, something more. Hope makes everything more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey makes a deal with the DA to turn over all the evidence she and Dylan have gathered against Keegan and Rollins—only to discover that the DA is in league with them too. After a desperate escape, who can they possibly turn to now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is running out for Casey, but master suspense writer Terri Blackstock will keep readers on the edge of their seats until the last, utterly satisfying page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Elite Guardians bodyguard Haley Callaghan may be in South Carolina, but when a photo leads investigators in West Ireland to open a twenty-five-year-old cold case, her life is suddenly in danger. Haley knows how to take care of herself; after all, she's made a career out of taking care of others. But after an uncomfortably close call, Detective Steven Rothwell takes it upon himself to stay with her--and the young client she has taken under her wing. A protector at heart, he's not about to let Haley fight this battle alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sweeping plot that takes them into long-buried memories--and the depths of the heart--Haley and Steven will have to solve the mystery of Haley's past while dodging bullets, bombs, and bad guys who just won't quit.</description>

  <description>Champion backcountry snowboarder Gage Watson has left the limelight behind after the death of one of his fans. After being sued for negligence and stripped of his sponsorships, he's remade his life as a ski patrol in Montana's rugged mountains, as well as serving on the PEAK Rescue team. But he can't seem to find his footing--or forget the woman he loved, who betrayed him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senator and former attorney Ella Blair spends much of her time in the limelight as the second-youngest senator in the country. But she has a secret--one that cost Gage his career. More than anything, she wants to atone for her betrayal of him in the courtroom and find a way to help him put his career back on track. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella's brother goes missing on one of Glacier National Park's most dangerous peaks, Gage and his team are called in for the rescue. But Gage isn't so sure he wants to help the woman who destroyed his life. More, when she insists on joining the search, he'll have to keep her safe while finding her reckless brother, a recipe for disaster when a snowstorm hits the mountain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But old sparks relight as they search for the missing snowboarder--and suddenly, they are faced with emotions neither can deny. But when Ella's secret is revealed, can they learn to trust each other--even when disaster happens again?</description>

  <description>Police officer Isabelle St. John loves her crazy, loud, law-enforcement family. With three brothers and two sisters, she's never without someone to hang out with—or fight with. And she knows they'll be there for her when things get tough. Like when her partner is murdered and she barely escapes with her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to discover exactly what happened, Izzy's investigation sends her headfirst into a criminal organization, possibly with cops on the payroll—including someone from her own family. With her dead partner's handsome homicide detective brother Ryan shadowing her every move, Izzy's head is spinning. How can she secure justice for her partner when doing so could mean sending someone she loves to prison? And how will she guard her heart when the man she's had a secret crush on for years won't leave her side?</description>

  <description>Luke Baxter--a lawyer specializing in religious freedom cases--takes on the fight of his life when public high school principal Wendell Quinn is sued for starting an after-school Bible study called Raise the Bar. Wendell has already lost the love of his life because of the program, but still he refuses to end it. Thanks to the program, Hamilton High has seen a dramatic decrease in the drug abuse, violence, and teen pregnancies that once plagued the student population. However, this lawsuit threatens to bring everything to a screeching halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But God's truth won't be silenced, and Luke Baxter vows to stand up for Wendell Quinn. Because the fight is about more than statistics, improved test scores, and better student life--it's about religious liberty and protecting the very things Wendell and the Baxters hold dear: faith, family, and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, though, Luke struggles to keep his work from taking over his life. His wife, Reagan, worries about his increased hours and time away from the family. She knows his job is crucial, but at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In This Moment&lt;/i&gt; is an inspiring, relevant story about the nuances of religious freedom, the cost of the fight, and how a group of determined people just might restore the meaning of faith in today’s culture.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Kingsbury comes a new book featuring everyone’s favorite family—the Baxters, which tells the story of how John and Elizabeth first fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the day they met, John and Elizabeth were destined to fall in love. Their whirlwind romance started when they were young college students and lasted nearly thirty years—until Elizabeth died of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when John Baxter is asked to relive his long-ago love story with Elizabeth for his grandson Cole’s heritage project, he’s not sure he can do it. The sadness might simply be too great. But he agrees and allows his heart and soul to go places they haven’t gone in decades. Back to the breathless first moments, but also to the secret heartbreak that brought John and Elizabeth together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, Baxter family friend Cody Coleman is working through the breakup of his complicated relationship with Andi Ellison. He is determined to move on when a chance sighting changes his plans—and heart. Can Cody convince Andi to give their love another try, or is it time for them to say goodbye for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As school comes to an end, Cole presents his report on the love story between his grandparents John and Elizabeth Baxter. It is a tale that touches the hearts of the entire family, and one that causes Cole to better understand his own beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re meeting the Baxter family for the first time or finding them all over again, &lt;i&gt;Love Story&lt;/i&gt; will stir your heart and remind you of the generational impact of love and the eternal bond of family.</description>

  <description>To save the lives of countless people in Captive’s Sound, Nadia has sworn herself to the One Beneath, to black magic. Her plan, and the town’s only hope, is for Nadia to learn enough sorcery to strike back against the forces of darkness. But now that she’s separated from her friends, her family, and her Steadfast, Mateo, Nadia is more vulnerable than ever to darkness. And as the sorceress Elizabeth summons torrential rains and brings the One Beneath closer to the mortal world, Nadia is running out of time to stop her. The final battle lines are drawn, surprising alliances are made, and true love is tested in the action-packed conclusion to the breathtaking Spellcaster series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sorceress&lt;/i&gt; is richly woven with &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Claudia Gray’s signature dark magic, captivating mystery, and star-crossed romance.</description>

  <description>When Nadia's family moves to Captive's Sound, she instantly realizes there's more to the place than meets the eye. Descended from witches, Nadia can sense that a spell has been cast over the tiny Rhode Island town—a sickness infecting everyone and everything in it. The magic at work is darker and more powerful than anything she's come across and has sunk its claws most deeply into Mateo . . . her rescuer, her friend, and the guy she yearns to get closer to even as he pushes her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mateo has lived in Captive's Sound his entire life, shadowed by small-town gossip and his family's tormented past. Every generation, the local legends say, one member of the family goes mad, claiming to know the future before descending into insanity. When the strange dreams Mateo has been having of rescuing a beautiful girl from a car accident actually come true, he knows he's doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the forces pulling them apart, Nadia and Mateo must work together to break the chains of his terrible family curse, and to prevent a coming disaster that even now threatens the entire town, including Nadia's family, her newfound friends, and her own life. Shimmering with magic and mystery, New York Times bestselling author Claudia Gray's new novel depicts a dark and unforgettable world of witches, curses, buried secrets, and star-crossed romance.</description>

  <description>Nadia, Mateo, and Verlaine have saved Captive's Sound from the dark Sorceress Elizabeth...or so they thought. Despite their best efforts, a crack opened and a new, greater evil seeped through. With Mateo as her Steadfast, Nadia's magic is magnified and she is more powerful than ever. But there is still so much she doesn't know about the craft, leaving her open and vulnerable to a darker magic...which has begun to call Nadia's name.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s official Take a Psycho to Work Day. Why else would I be here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunted. Hated. Betrayed. Dagger Ixur is on the run for his life. As one of the most recognizable members of his royal house, he has a bounty on his head that guarantees him no quarter from any friend or even family. But surrender isn’t in him. He will fight to the bitter end. A resolve that is sorely tested when he narrowly escapes a trap that leaves him severely wounded. With what he believes is his dying breath, he saves a boy born to an extinct race from a group out to enslave the kid for his legendary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ushara Altaan has spent her entire life hating those born to nobility. After all, it was a royal house that drove her entire species into virtual extinction. As a rare Andarion Fyreblood, she is sworn to end the existence of any royal she finds. But when Dagger saves her son’s life, she is torn between her people and a debt that can never be repaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet worse than Dagger’s family that’s still out to end hers, are the League assassins after him who will stop at nothing to claim the lives of her Tavali family. The only hope she has to save them all is to put their future and her faith into the hands of the very enemy whose grandmother personally extinguished Ushara’s legendary lineage. But how can she ever trust Dagger when he is a disinherited outlaw whose very name is synonymous with betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;A fate worse than death . . .&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bastien Cabarro survived the brutal slaughter of his entire family only to have his wife pin their murders on him. Made Ravin by The League, he is now a target for their assassins-in-training to hunt and kill. The average life expectancy for such beings is six weeks. But defying the odds is what this Gyron Force officer does best, and Bastien won’t rest until he lays his betrayers in their graves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten years later, he has one chance to balance the scales of justice, provided he relies on his former wingman— the very sister of the woman who testified against him.&lt;br /&gt; Major Ember Wyldestarrin joined the outlaw Tavali the day Kirovar fell into the hands of a tyrant, and she and her team were left on an outpost to die under the barrage of enemy fire. The last thing she wants is to be involved in politics again. But if she doesn’t bring Bastien in, her sister will pay the ultimate price. Now she has to find some way to betray her former wingman before he catches on and kills her. Even so, treachery doesn’t come easy to a woman who took a loyalty oath to protect her homeworld and comrades-in-arms, especially when Bastien means more to her than just another partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet as she tries to do right for her family, she learns that Bastien doesn’t just hold the key to the fate of Kirovar, he is vital to The Sentella-League war, and to The Tavali. If she hands him over, three nations fall. If she doesn’t, her entire family dies. Their fates are all in her hands, and time for all of them is quickly running out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Years ago, family loyalty caused Fain Hauk to give up everything he loved: His military career. His planet. His fiancée. Even his name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now decades later, everything has changed. He’s built a new life out of the ashes of his old, and he’s vowed to never let anything threaten his loved ones again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when old enemies align themselves with new ones, he’s caught in the middle of a brutal war. And when fate throws his former fiancée back into his world and she has her own agenda that includes taking his head for what he did to her years ago, more than just his life is at stake. The fate of the Ichidian universe and that of his brothers-in-arms hangs in the balance. Winner take all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s killed or be killed, and never has the battle been more fierce...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or more fun. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Born an Outcast, Talyn Batur has spent the whole of his life fighting against the prejudice of his people. An Andarion without a father is not something anyone wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his companion's brother draws him into a plot against the Andarion crown, he finds himself torn between the loyalty to their planetary government that his mother has beaten into him and his own beliefs of justice and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he must decide for himself to remain a pawn of their government or to defy everything and everyone he's ever known to stand up to tyranny. It's a gamble that will either save his life or end it. And when old enemies align with new ones, it's more than just his own life at risk. And more than just his homeworld that will end should he fail, in &lt;i&gt;Born of Defiance&lt;/i&gt;, the next League novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon.</description>

  <description>The war is on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Counted among the fiercest Andarion warriors ever born, Hauk is one of the five founding members of the Sentella- an organization that has declared war on the League that rules the Ichidian universe with an iron fist and terrifies it with an army of well-trained assassins. Hauk's enemies are legion, but he fears nothing and no one. He will do whatever it takes to survive and protect his Sentella brethren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sumi Antaxas is one of the best assassins the League has ever trained. In her world, failure is not an option and she has never met a target she couldn't execute. So when she's assigned Hauk, she believes it'll be a quick and easy mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing is ever as simple as it seems, and Hauk is far better trained and skilled than his dossier shows. More than that, as she pursues him, she stumbles upon the key that will bring down not only Hauk, but the entire Sentella organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the race to report her information, she is overtaken by enemies out to end her as effectively as she intends to end Hauk. Now her only key to survival is the one man she's been sent to kill. And Hauk doesn't trust her at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question is, will he help her to live... or send her to her grave.</description>

  <description>Every Life Has A Price™&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the fiercest soldiers the Phrixians have ever produced, Maris Sulle has been an outsider from the moment he was born different from the rest of his royal military family. And once his deadly secret was exposed, it cost him everything—his birthright, his family, and his stellar military career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ture Xans spent his entire life hiding from everyone around him—his family, his friends, and anyone who wanted to get close to him—while trying desperately to fit in and keep his head low. Badly hurt by everyone he’s ever known, he trusts no one except his own best friend. But honestly, he can’t understand why he trusts her. Nor can he believe her when she describes a loyalty between the League allies the likes of which he’s never seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet when Ture is captured by the League in a coup he wanted no part of, his life is saved by a hero he thought only existed in fables. A man who is every bit as scarred and mistrusting as he is. One who has no interest in being dragged into another war for any reason. Having spent his life as a living study of doomed relationships, Maris is well aware of the fiasco that invariably follows. Still, there is something about Ture he can’t resist. Something that won’t let him walk away when he knows he should. But when old enemies return to threaten them both, they either have to stand together or die alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Death Stalks Them All...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kere is the second most infamous member of the shadow organization known as Sentella. An explosive engineer who strikes terror into the hearts of the League, the bounty on his head is truly staggering. No one knows his true identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daughter of a traitor, Zarya Starska grew up hard on the back streets of hell- her family hunted to the brink of extinction. But Zarya dreams of a different life and a different world. A world where the harsh hand of the Caronese emperor doesn’t destroy his subjects. As a Resistance leader, her goal is to topple the government that needlessly ruined the lives of her family and comrades-in-arms. In this deadly quest, the only person she can trust is a mysterious man known only as Kere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;By The Light Of Day...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kere has a dark secret and a brutal past. As he aids the Resistance, he’s actually working to bring down his own family- the Cruels- so named for the viciousness in their blood that runs so deep, no other name would do. Born and bred from one of the oldest and noblest families in the United Systems, Kere’s real name is Darling Cruel. And the one thing he wants most is to see his uncle, who stole the crown by murdering his father, pay for his crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;If You Tell A Lie Long Enough, It Becomes The Truth...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to protect his mother from execution, Darling’s entire life has been built on a lie that he dare not breathe a contrary word about. His hands tied by his uncle’s cruelty. No one has ever seen the real him. No one except Zarya. She’s the only person he’s ever fully trusted with the truth. But when she betrays him by allowing a weapon he designed solely for her to be used against him, all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Hero Is Now The Monster...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayed to the deepest level, Darling becomes an enemy even worse than his uncle. His goal is not only to reign, but to kill every Resistance member he can find. He won’t rest until all of them are dead and that includes Zarya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Twisted Hand Of Fate...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zarya is the only hope to reach the heart of the man her people once considered their ally. A man who hates her with a fury so great that she knows it’s just a matter of time before he kills her. But if she can find the part of him that once trusted her, the part of him that once loved her, she might be able to save not only her own life, but those of her people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s an impossible mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad she doesn’t play the odds.</description>

  <description>In a world where the League and its assassins rule, where betrayal and treachery are everywhere...the only survivors are those ones who are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BORN OF SHADOWS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Caillen Dagan, a defiant soldier of fortune, survival isn't a right, it's a brutal daily battle. Moving through the Ichidaian universe like a wraith, his brushes with the law and death are legendary. But when an act of rare heroism reveals his hidden birthright, he's forced into a world much more dangerous and cold-hearted than the bloody streets where he was raised - one of obscene wealth and lethal politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferocious and determined, Desideria serves as an official bodyguard for her queen. Born of questionable genetics, she will do anything to prove herself worthy of the weapons she carries and the position she's won by combat. But when she uncovers a ruthless plot to assassinate the queen and overthrow her country's government, Desideria is caught in the crosshairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With assassination contracts out on both of them, Caillen and Desideria must learn to fight together or die alone. And if they fail, their governments will fall into the hands of an unimaginable evil.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the Ichidian Universe where The League is law, most live in fear. We fight back. Welcome to a world where corrupt assassination politics dominate everyone. It’s kill or be killed. Welcome back to the future…and meet hell's new breed of heroes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devyn Kell spent his life in service to the League until he learned of the double dealing and backstabbing that was costing innocent people their lives. Refusing to play those politics, he became a Runner; someone who makes sure planets get the weapons, medicine and supplies they need to survive. May the gods have mercy on any who get in his way, because he definitely won’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alix Garran is a woman on the run from a past she can’t escape. Signing on to work for Devyn as a System’s Engineer, she finds a cause she can fight for—and a man she can respect. But as Alix’s past catches up to her, and Devyn’s old enemies turn lethal, they have to fight together…or fall alone, in &lt;i&gt;Born of Ice&lt;/i&gt;, the third bestselling League novel from Sherrilyn Kenyon.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a universe where assassins make the law, everyone lives in fear--except for Syn. Born of an illicit scandal that once rocked a dynasty, he always knew how to survive on the bloodthirsty streets. But that was then, and the future is now…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syn was raised as a tech-thief until his livelihood uncovered a truth that could end his life. He tried to destroy the evidence, and has been on the run ever since. Now trained as an assassin, he allows no one to threaten him. Ever. He is the darkness that swallows his enemies whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shahara Dagan is the best bounty hunter in the universe. When Syn comes back on the radar, she's the only one who can bring him to justice. There's only one problem: Syn is a close family friend who's helped out the Dagans countless times. But if she saves him, both of their lives will be on the line. Is Syn's protection worth the risk? The only hope Shahara has is to find the evidence he buried long ago. Now it's kill or be killed--and they, the predators, have just become the hunted…</description>

  <description>In the war against vampires, mankind has only one hope: The Dark-Hunters. Ancient warriors who died of brutal betrayal, the Dark-Hunters have sworn themselves into the service of the goddess Artemis to protect us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a pact with pretty good perks. Immortality, power, psychic abilities, wealth and a cool wardrobe. But it comes with a few drawbacks: fatal sun poisoning and a new, irreparable dental problem. But aside from the fangs and nocturnal lifestyle, it's not so bad.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this volume, the adventure continues with Talon and Sunshine as they face off against the Greek and Celtic gods bent on making a major comeback.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ever think Scrooge had it right before the ghosts ruined his life? Meet Aidan O'Conner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;At one time he was a world-renowned celebrity who gave freely of himself and his money without wanting anything in return...until those around him took without asking. Now Aidan wants nothing of the world--or anyone who's a part of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a stranger appears at his doorstep, Aidan knows he's seen her before…in his dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born on Olympus as a goddess, Leta knows nothing of the human world. But a ruthless enemy has driven her from the world of dreams and into the home of the only man who can help her: Aidan. Her immortal powers are derived from human emotions--and his anger is just the fuel she needs to defend herself…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One cold winter's night will change their lives forever…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped together in a brutal winter storm, Aidan and Leta must turn to the only power capable of saving them--or destroying them both: trust.</description>

  <description>It’s a demon-eat-demon world for Nick Gautier. Just when he thinks he’s finally gotten a handle on how not to take over the world and destroy it, Death returns with an all-star cast that is determined to end the Malachai reign and lineage forever. Worse? Death and War have found the one, true enemy Nick can’t find, and even if he did, it’s one he could never bring himself to banish or kill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now framed for murders he hasn’t committed, and surrounded by new friends who might be turncoats, Nick is learning fast how his father went down in flames. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The heat in New Orleans is rising fast, and Nick’s threat-level has gone into a whole new level of intensity. He’s learning fast that when War and Death decide to battle, they don’t take prisoners. The don’t negotiate. And they’re both immune to his biting sarcasm and Cajun charm. To win this, he will have to embrace a new set of powers, but one wrong step, and he will belong to the side of Darkness, forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Praise for Chronicles of Nick: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Illusion [is] another great story. The humour [is] spot on… great balance between action and storytelling.” – Total Book Geek on Illusion &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“[Chock] full of action, suspense, emotion, Nick’s perfectly timed humour and sarcasm, friends coming together to help one another, danger and peril at every turn, and of course Kenyon’s brilliant world building, character creations, and imagination that make you forget you are reading a work of fiction.” –The Reading Café on Instinct &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Nick never ceases to amaze me. …My words don't do him justice. You won't understand until you read the book. So read the book, please? You won't regret it.”―My Not So Salient Life on Instinct &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“The perfect amount of action, snark and intriguing character development.”―Teen Library on Instinct &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About the Author: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York Times and international bestselling author, Sherrilyn Kenyon, is a regular at the #1 spot.

  <description>In the war against vampires, mankind has only one hope: The Dark-Hunters. Ancient warriors who died of brutal betrayal, the Dark-Hunters have sworn themselves into the service of the goddess Artemis to protect us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a pact with pretty good perks. Immortality, power, psychic abilities, wealth and a cool wardrobe. But it comes with a few drawbacks: fatal sun poisoning and a new, irreparable dental problem. But aside from the fangs and nocturnal lifestyle, it's not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyrian is an immortal Dark-Hunter who just lost his Dark-Hunter powers and along with it, his immortality. Now he is faced with the chance to regain not only his humanity, but his very soul. The problem is, it couldn’t have happened at a worse time. Desiderius is closing in and if Kyrian and Amanda are going to save humanity then Kyrian must take the war to his enemy or it may be too late.</description>

  <description>Violet Carmichael knew her second year of college would be tough, but nothing could have prepared her for what was about to happen… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Violet’s goal is clear—to finish college and work alongside her father and uncle at their family business—but she has one major problem. The dreaded Professor Torres, head of the Architectural Department at Tulane, has a reputation as one of the toughest teachers on campus. Violet has heard more than once that he can be a downright jerk, but she’s determined to not let him get in her way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He might be a successful professor, but his personal life is nothing short of a mess… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diego Torres has the worst track record when it comes to women—which is why when he first lays eyes on his new student, he assumes she’s like all the other superficial Barbie dolls he’s always been attracted to. But it only takes a few encounters for him to realize he couldn’t have been more wrong, and the more time he spends with Violet, the more he desires her in a way no professor should desire a student. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it’s impossible to walk away, even when there’s so much at stake… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After desperately trying avoid crossing that thin ethical line, Diego and Violet are no longer able to deny the sexual tension between them and risk everything, falling into an all-consuming, passionate relationship. But when outsiders threaten to destroy it all, Diego has no choice but to make a life-altering decision for himself and the woman he is forbidden to love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As lines between student and professor begin to blur, the consequences might end up destroying them both…</description>

  <description>For countless centuries, I've been the assassin for the infamous Merlin, even though the woman who birthed me sits at the right hand of our enemy, Morgen le Fey. Now both my mother and Morgen have decided that it's time I take my place on their side of this conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, telling them no wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the good guys I protect think that I'm an even worse demon than the ones we fight. Hmm, maybe they're right. I have to say that I do enjoy maiming anyone who gets in my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least until my mother gives me a simple choice: join Morgen's Circle of the Damned or see an innocent woman die. I'm all for saving the innocent, but Merewyn isn't as innocent as she seems. And she's none too fond of the fact that her fate is in my dubious hands. Personally I'm all for taking the easy way out, but leaving her to Morgen is rough, even for me. Now the only way to save both our lives is to face the evilest forces ever known—my mother and Morgen. And two people who know nothing of trust must learn to rely on each other or die: provided we don't kill each other first.</description>

  <description>The Mayans aren’t the only ones with a 2012 prophecy…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long before recorded history, there was a Keetoowah warrior so feared that everyone trembled before his wrath. Only a brutal betrayal by the one closest to him could defeat him. But not even death was the end of a man so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Time Untime approaches…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kateri Avani has been plagued her entire life with dreams she doesn’t understand. Images of places she’s never been and of a man she’s never seen. Her quest for answers has driven her to Las Vegas where she hopes to finally silence the demons in her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she never anticipates is coming face to face with the warrior who has haunted her her entire life. One who belongs to a world the scientist in her refuses to believe is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren Waya came back from the dead to keep the prophecy he began from coming true and ending the world. For thousands of years, he has fought the same evil that once possessed him. But now that evil has found the one person he can’t fight. The one person who, against his will, holds the most sacred part of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if he doesn’t kill Kateri, the deadliest of evils will reemerge and destroy everyone else on the planet. It was a sacrifice he made once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he be able to make it again?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the Ichidian Universe, The League and their ruthless assassins rule all. Expertly trained and highly valued, the League Assassins are the backbone of the government. But not even the League is immune to corruption . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Command Assassin Nykyrian Quikiades once turned his back on the League—and has been hunted by them ever since. Though many have tried, none can kill him or stop him from completing his current mission: to protect Kiara Zamir, a woman whose father’s political alliance has made her a target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her world becomes even deadlier, Kiara must entrust her life to the same kind of beast who once killed her mother and left her for dead. Old enemies and new threaten them both and the only way they can survive is to overcome their suspicions and learn to trust in the very ones who threaten them the most: each other.</description>

  <description>After three months of &lt;i&gt;draus in da Welt&lt;/i&gt;, Ariana has returned to Summer Grove, the Old Order Amish community where she was raised for twenty years, and life with her Brenneman family. Skylar Nash, the Englisch-raised young woman is working in Ariana’s café while getting to know her birth family and their Plain way of life. Skylar's time in Summer Grove has changed her outlook, just as Ariana has grown to see her personal faith in God in a different light than the manner she was taught while growing up. Both women will have to make decisions about their paths— and Ariana must decide what role her childhood friend, ex-Amish Quill Schlabach, will play in her life.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gathering the Threads&lt;/i&gt; is the third and final novel in the Amish of Summer Grove series.</description>

  <description>Think you have a lot of pressure on your shoulders? Nick Gautier was born to bring about the end of the world . . . it's not easy being the heir of a demon overlord.&lt;p&gt; But Nick is determined to thwart his destiny and get into a good college. To be more than his genetics and prophecy foretell. No one is ever going to tell this stubborn Cajun who and what he really is. Or how to live his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not even the Fates of the Universe. But now that he and his team of ancient gods and demons have claimed the Eye of Ananke and he sees the missteps of the future, he has to battle the demons within that are far deadlier and more treacherous than any he's battled before. All the while his arch nemesis is back and determined to reclaim his place as the harbinger for Armageddon. Even if it means killing Nick and barbecuing everyone he loves to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Deadmen tell their tales . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To catch evil, it takes evil. Enter Devyl Bane―an ancient dark warlord returned to the human realm as one of the most notorious pirates in the New World. A man of many secrets, Bane makes a pact with Thorn―an immortal charged with securing the worst creations the ancient gods ever released into our world. Those powers have been imprisoned for eons behind enchanted gates . . . gates that are beginning to buckle. At Thorn’s behest, Bane takes command of a crew of Deadmen and, together, they are humanity’s last hope to restore the gates and return the damned to their hell realms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things are never so simple. And one of Bane’s biggest problems is the ship they sail upon. For the Sea Witch isn’t just a vessel, she’s also a woman born of an ancient people he wronged and who in turn wronged him during a centuries long war between their two races―a woman who is also sister to their primary target. Now Marcelina, the Sea Witch, must choose. Either she remains loyal to her evil sister and almost extinct race against Bane and his cause, and watches humanity fall, or she puts faith in an enemy who has already betrayed her. Her people over the totality of humanity―let’s hope Bane can sway her favor.</description>

  <description>The new king of Camelot wears no shining armor: Arthur and his knights have fallen and a new king rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the darkest forest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scared, forsaken youth has become the most powerful—and feared—man in the world. Ruthless and unrestrained, Kerrigan has long ceased to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the heart of London...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spirited peasant mired in drudgery, Seren dreams of becoming her own woman, but never expects that by fleeing her fate, she will meet her destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their worlds are forever changed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerrigan's goal is simple: barter or kill Seren to claim Arthur's Round Table. Yet she is the one person who holds no fear of him. More than that, her nobility sparks something foreign inside him. In his nether realm, kindness is weakness and a king who harbors any sort of compassion loses his throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For countless centuries, Kerrigan has lived alone in the shadows. Now Seren's courage has forced him into the light that will bring either salvation to both of them...or death.</description>

  <description>There is nothing in the universe the cursed dragon, Falcyn, hates more than humanity . . . and in particular, Greek humans. In a war he wanted no part of, they systematically destroyed everything he’d ever cared for. Now he lies in seclusion, away from the world and waits for the day when evolution will finally rid him of the human vermin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medea was born the granddaughter of the Greek god Apollo, and among the first of his people that he cursed to die. But she will not let anyone rule her life. Not even her notorious grandfather. And when Apollo sends a new plague to destroy what remains of her people, she refuses to standby and watch him take everything she loves from her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, she knows of a secret weapon that can stop the ancient god and his army of demons. Once and for all. However, said device is in the hands of a dragon who wants nothing to do with politics, the gods, humanity, demons or Greek Apollites. And especially not her. He is the immovable object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My enemy’s enemy . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Apollo makes a strategic move that backfires, he forces Falcyn back into play. Now Medea either has the weapon she needs to save her people, or she’s unleashed total Armageddon. If she can’t find some way to control the dragon before it’s too late, Falcyn will be an even worse plague on the world than the one Apollo has set loose. But how can anyone control a demonic dragon whose sole birthright is total destruction?</description>

  <description>Zombies, demons, vampires, shapeshifters— another day in the life of Nick Gautier– and those are just his friends. But now that he’s accepted the demon that lives inside him, he must learn to control it and temper the very emotions that threaten the lives of everyone he cares for. Something that’s hard to do while trying to stay off the menus of those who want his head on a platter. And no one wants him more than the dark gods who created his race. Now that they know where he is, they will stop at nothing to reclaim him. And without knowing it, Nick has just embraced the one person he should never have trusted. The one person who will hand him over to his enemies to get back the life they lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick has finally accepted his fate, now he must learn to defy his destiny, and the dark, deadly forces that will stop at nothing to destroy everyone he loves so that they can again return to the world of man and own it.</description>

  <description>Be careful what you wish for . . . You just might get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Gautier is tired of his destiny. He doesn’t want to be the son of a demon who’s fated to end the world. Nor does he want to see another demon or other preternatural creature who wants to kill or enslave him. He just wants to be normal and have normal problems like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But normality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. When he gets sucked into an alternate reality where his mother has married his mentor and his Atlantean god best friend has become a human geek, he begins to understand that no life is free of pain, and that every person has a specific place in the universe . . . Even the son of a hated demon. Most of all, he sees that his powers aren’t the curse he thought they were, and that the world needs a champion, especially one its enemies can’t imagine rising up to defend the ones he should destroy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old enemies and new friends square off for a major battle that will either restore Nick to his real world, or end him forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The heat is on, and a new threat to humanity has risen . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick has his driver's license and he's not afraid to use it. But turning sixteen isn't what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying for college, Nick is neck deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person he's been told will ultimately kill him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes it's the one that leaves your enemies confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you?</description>

Teaching dance classes with enthusiastic kids is just the kind of job she needs—far away from probing eyes or vicious intentions of the opposite sex. When she connects with one of her students, Natalie, it isn’t long until she meets her father, Deputy Ben James. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ben James is just a regular guy, working to make a life for himself and his daughter… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s what Abby tells herself when her sudden attraction for Ben catches her off guard. Abby has been steering clear of men for obvious reasons, and the idea of wanting that kind of relationship is more terrifying than intriguing. But with his doe-eyed daughter tugging at her dance uniform, Ben takes notice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s ready for love, but does her past hold too many secrets? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the assault, Abby coped by using heavy medication and fell into an ugly chain of one-night stands. But now that she’s out of rehab and finally on the right track, it’s only a matter of time before Ben finds out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Abby be the true love Ben has always wanted? Or is she a tangled challenge, leading to yet another… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broken Love?</description>

  <description>Centuries ago, Illarion was betrayed– a dragon made human against his will, then forced to serve humanity as a dragonmount in their army, and to fight for them in barbaric wars, even while he hated everything about them. Enslaved and separated from everyone he knew and from his own dragon brothers, he was forced into exile in a fey realm where he lost the only thing he ever really loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he has a chance to regain what’s been lost— to have the one thing he covets most. But only if he gives up his brothers and forsakes the oaths he holds most dear. Yet what terrifies him most isn’t the cost his happiness might incur, it’s the fact that there is just enough human in his dragon’s heart that he might actually be willing to pay it and betray everything and everyone– to see the entire world burn...</description>

  <description>Out of all the mysterious boarders who call Sanctuary home, no one is more antisocial or withdrawn than Maxis Drago. But then, it’s hard to blend in with the modern world when you have a fifty foot wingspan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries ago, he was cursed by an enemy who swore to see him fall. An enemy who took everything from him and left him forever secluded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Fate is a bitch, with a wicked sense of humor. And when she throws old enemies together and threatens the wife he thought had died centuries ago, he comes back with a vengeance. Modern day New Orleans has become a battleground for the oldest of evils. And two dragons will hold the line, or go down in flames.</description>

  <description>It’s not easy being life’s own personal joke, but Josette Landry has made an unstable peace with the beast. Life will continue to throw every bad thing it has at her, and she will continue to not put her head in an oven. But that’s okay. That which doesn’t kill her will just require a few hours of mental insanity. Completely down on her luck, Josette takes a job with a local paranormal group trying to get their own cable show as a photographer and camerawoman. Yeah, they’re even crazier than she is. The only paranormal thing she believes in is the miracle that keeps her rusted out hoopty running. But when her group accidentally releases something truly evil into the world, they are forced to call in reinforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Josette meets Cadegan, she knows something about him isn’t quite right. And it’s not just because she can’t even begin to pronounce his last name: Maboddimun. Mysterious and armed with lethal sarcasm, he seems a lot older than his apparent age…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries ago, Cadegan sold his soul for vengeance against the betrayer who cursed him. Forced against his will to do good, he hates everything in life. All he wants is a way out. But for the damned there is only eternal suffering. And yet there is something about Josette that intrigues him as much as it irritates and frustrates him. Something he can’t seem to fight, and the last time he felt this way about a woman, it cost him his soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows he has to stay away from her, but the evil her friends unleashed is hellbent on consuming her soul. Something he cannot allow. If one more innocent is taken, he will be sent back to an unimaginable prison that makes his current hell look like paradise. But how can he keep her safe when his being with her is the greatest threat of all?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Just when you thought doomsday was over...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries ago Acheron saved the human race by imprisoning an ancient evil bent on absolute destruction. Now that evil has been unleashed and it is out for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the twin to Acheron, Styxx hasn’t always been on his brother’s side. They’ve spent more centuries going at each other’s throats than protecting their backs. Now Styxx has a chance to prove his loyalty to his brother, but only if he’s willing to trade his life and future for Acheron’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Atlantean goddess of Wrath and Misery, Bethany was born to right wrongs. But it was never a task she relished. Until now. She owes Acheron a debt that she vows to repay, no matter what it takes. He will join their fellow gods in hell and nothing is going to stop her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things are never what they seem, and Acheron is no longer the last of his line. Styxx and Acheron must put aside their past and learn to trust each other or more will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it’s hard to risk your own life for someone who once tried to take yours, even when it's your own twin, and when loyalties are skewed and no one can be trusted, not even yourself, how do you find a way back from the darkness that wants to consume the entire world? One that wants to start by devouring your very soul?</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dream-Hunter Lydia has been charged with the most sacred and dangerous of missions: To descend into the Nether Realm and find the missing god of dreams before he betrays the secrets that could kill her and her kind. What she never expects is to be taken prisoner by the Realm’s most vicious guardian…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth’s time is running out. If he can’t hand over the entrance to Olympus, his own life and those of his people will be forfeit. No matter the torture, Seth hasn’t been able to break the god in his custody. Then there’s the beautiful Dream-Hunter Lydia: She isn’t just guarding the gates of Olympus—she’s holding back one of the world’s darkest powers. If she fails, an ancient curse will haunt the earth once more and no one will be safe. But evil is always seductive...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Harm no human...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hired gunslinger, William Jessup Brady lived his life with one foot in the grave. He believed that every life had a price. Until the day when he finally found a reason to live. In one single act of brutal betrayal, he lost everything, including his life. Brought back by a Greek goddess to be one of her Dark-Hunters, he gave his immortal soul for vengeance and swore he'd spend eternity protecting the humans he'd once considered prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned as a toddler, Abigail Yager was taken in by a family of vampires and raised on one belief - Dark-Hunters are the evil who prey on both their people and mankind, and they must all be destroyed. While protecting her adoptive race, she has spent her life eliminating the Dark-Hunters and training for the day when she meeting the man who killed her family: Jess Brady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gun in the hand is worth two in the holster....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess has been charged with finding and terminating the creature who's assassinating Dark-Hunters. The last thing he expects to find is a human face behind the killings, but when that face bears a striking resemblance to the one who murdered him centuries ago, he knows something evil is going on. He also knows he's not the one who killed her parents. But Abigail refuses to believe the truth and is determined to see him dead once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought together by an angry god and chased by ancient enemies out to kill them both, they must find a way to overcome their mutual hatred or watch as one of the darkest of powers rises and kills both the races they've sworn to protect.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;As an ancient Sumerian god, Sin was one of the most powerful among his pantheon.  . . Until the night Artemis brutally stole his godhood and left him for dead. For millennia, this ex-god turned Dark-Hunter has dreamed only of regaining his powers and seeking revenge on Artemis. If only life were that simple.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately he has bigger fish--or in Sin's case--demons, to fry. The lethal gallu that were buried by his pantheon are now stirring and they are hungry for human flesh. Their goal is to destroy mankind and anyone else who gets in their way.  Sin is the only one who can stop them--that is if a certain woman doesn't kill him first. Unfortunately, Sin discovers that now he must rely on her or witness an annihilation of biblical proportions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enemies have always made strange bedfellows, but never more so than when the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Now a man who knows only betrayal must trust the one person most likely to hand him to the demons. Artemis may have stolen his godhood, but this one has stolen his heart. The only question is will she keep it or feed it to the ones who want him dead? &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Live fast, fight hard and if you have to die then take as many of your enemies with you as you can. That is the Amazon credo and it was one Samia lived and died by. Now in contemporary New Orleans, the immortal Amazon warrior is about to learn that there’s a worse evil coming to slaughter mankind than she’s ever faced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shapeshifter Dev Peltier has stood guard at the front of Sanctuary for almost two hundred years and in that time, he’s seen it all. Or so he thought. Now their enemies have discovered a new source of power- one that makes a mockery of anything faced to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war is on and Dev and Sam are guarding ground zero. But in order to win, they will have to break the most cardinal of all rules and pray it doesn’t unravel the universe as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>We are the Dolophoni. Diligent. Vigilant. Fierce and inescapable. Servants of the Furies, we are the right hand of justice and no one stands before us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of Warcraft and Hate, Cratus spent eternity battling for the ancient gods who birthed him. He was death to any who crossed him. Until the day he laid down his arms and was banished into exile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now an ancient enemy has been unleashed and our dreams are his chosen battlefield. The only hope we have is the one god who swears he will never fight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Dream-Hunter, Delphine has spent eternity protecting mankind from the predators who prey on our unconscious state. But now that her allies have been turned, she knows in order to survive, the Dream-Hunters need a new leader. Someone who can train them to fight their new enemies. Cratus is her only hope. But she is a bitter reminder of why he chose to lay down his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is running out and if she can’t win him to her cause, mankind will be slaughtered and the world we know will soon cease to exist.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A stunning and suspenseful new landscape emerges in the thrilling Dark-Hunter world—a world where nothing will ever be the same again. . .&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fang Kattalakis isn't just a wolf. He is the brother of two of the most powerful members of the Omegrion: the ruling council that enforces the laws of the Were-Hunters. And when war erupts among the lycanthropes, sides must be chosen. Enemies are forced into shaky alliances. And when the woman Fang loves is accused of betraying her people, her only hope is that Fang believes in her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet in order to save her, Fang must break the law of his people and the faith of his brothers. That breech could very well spell the end of both their races and change their world forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war is on and time is running out...</description>

  <description>While the world carries on unawares, Stryker, who leads an army of demons and vampires, is plotting an all out onslaught against his enemies—which, unfortunately for us, includes the entire human race. To avenge his sister, Stryker prepares to annihilate the Dark-Hunters. But things go awry when his oldest enemy returns. Enter his ex-wife. Zephyra. Just when he thought nothing could stop him, he's now embroiled in a centuries old war with a shrew who gives new meaning to pain.</description>

  <description>Hades doesn't often give second chances....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xypher has one month on Earth to redeem himself through one good deed or be condemned to eternal torture in Tarturus. But redemption means little to a demigod who only wants vengeance on the one who caused his downfall.Until one day in a cemetery....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simone Dubois is a medical examiner with a real knack for the job. Those who are wrongfully killed appear to her and help her find the evidence the police need to convict their killers. But when a man appears and tells her that she's more than just a psychic, she's convinced he's insane.Now the fate of the world hangs in her hands....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was bad enough when just the dead relied on her. Now's there's the seductive Dream-Hunter Xypher who needs Simone's help in opening a portal to the Atlantean hell realm to fight insatiable demons. The future of mankind is at stake - and so is her life. The only question now is: Who is the bigger threat: the demons out to kill her, or the man who has left her forever changed?</description>

  <description>In the ethereal world of dreams, there are champions who fight to protect the dreamer and there are demons who prey on them... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arik is such a predator. Condemned by the gods to live eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he's in the dreams of others. For thousands of years, he's drifted through the human unconscious, searching for sensation. Now he's finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Megeara Kafieri watched her father ruin himself and his reputation as he searched to prove Atlantis was real. Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she's seen many times.... in her dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn't know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis. He has made a pact with the god Hades: In exchange for two weeks as a mortal man, he must return to Olympus with a human soul. Megeara's soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a secret society out to ruin her expedition, and mysterious accidents that keep threatening her life, Megeara refuses to quit. She knows she's getting closer to Atlantis and as she does, she stumbles onto the truth of what Arik really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Arik his quest is no longer simple. No human can know of a Dream-Hunter's existence. His dream of being mortal has quickly turned into his own nightmare and the only way to save himself will be to sacrifice the very thing he wanted to be human for. The only question is, will he?</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half animal, half man, wholly dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;Locked in eternal battle, a Were-Hunter knows everything about peril and pain. But the greatest threat is yet to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Michaels was once the hottest reporter on the Beltway Beat until she walked into a setup that ruined her reputation. Now she's working for a small Seattle paper, penning stories about killer moths and alien babies, convinced that her life couldn't get any worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was before an idea for a breaking news piece brings her to a local animal shelter where she ends up listening to her source rant about vampires and gets coerced into adopting a cat despite her allergies. But when her new pet suddenly reveals himself to be a gorgeous - and lethal - shapeshifter, Susan realizes that there's far more at stake than a career-saving by-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born into a world of predators, Were-Hunter Ravyn Kontis was betrayed by those he loved best. Soulless, pitiless, he has spent three hundred years battling the Diamons who seek to subjugate humankind. And with the ultimate battle about to begin, this one very human woman holds the power to shatter both their worlds...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's a predator-eat-predator world for the Were-Hunters. Danger haunts any given day. There is no one to trust. No one to love. Not if they want to live...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An orphan with no clan that will claim him, Wren Tigarian grew to adulthood under the close scrutiny and mistrust of those around him. A forbidden blend of two animals - snow leopard and white tiger - Wren has never listened to anyone when there was something he wanted. Now he wants Marguerite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marguerite D'Aubert Goudeau is the daughter of a prominent U.S. senator who hates the socialite life she's forced to live. Like her mother before her, she has strong Cajun roots that her father doesn't understand. Still, she has no choice but to try and conform to a world where she feels like an outsider. But the world of rich and powerful humans is never to meet the world of the Were-Hunters who exist side by side with them, unseen, unknown, undetected. To break this law is to call down a wrath of the highest order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to have Marguerite, Wren must fight not just the humans who will never accept his animal nature, but the Were-Hunters who want him dead for endangering their world. It's a race against time and magic without boundary that could cost Marguerite and Wren not just their lives, but their very souls...</description>

  <description>Just when he thought things couldn’t get any worse... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Gautier’s day just keeps getting better and better. Yeah, he survived the zombie attacks, only to wake up and find himself enslaved to a world of shapeshifters and demons out to claim his soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His new principal thinks he’s even more of a hoodlum than the last one, his coach is trying to recruit him to things he can’t even mention and the girl he’s not seeing, but is, has secrets that terrify him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more than that, he’s being groomed by the darkest of powers and if he doesn’t learn how to raise the dead by the end of the week, he will become one of them...</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the realm of the Dark-Hunters there is a code of honor that even immortal bad boys must follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harm no human. Drink no blood. Never fall in love. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every now and again a Dark-Hunter thinks himself above the Code. That's when I'm summoned. Who am I? I'm the one thing the fearless fear. Step over the line and it's my wrath you will face. Nothing can touch me. Nothing can sway me. I am relentless and unfeeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought until I met a female Dark-Hunter who goes by the name of Danger-it's not just her name, it's how she lives her life. She doesn't trust me at all. And who could blame her? She alone knows that I'm here to be judge, jury and most likely executioner of her friends. Yet she is my key to saving some of them. Without her, they all will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dangereuse St. Richard is a deadly distraction. Something about her is reawakening a heart I thought was long dead. But in a race against evil, the only hope mankind has is that I do my duty. And how can I do my duty when it means that I will have to sacrifice the only woman I've ever loved?&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>At fourteen, Nick Gautier thinks he knows everything about the world around him. Streetwise, tough and savvy, his quick sarcasm is the stuff of legends... until the night when his best friends try to kill him. Saved by a mysterious warrior who has more fighting skills than Chuck Norris, Nick is sucked into the realm of the Dark-Hunters: immortal vampire slayers who risk everything to save humanity.&lt;p&gt;Nick quickly learns that the human world is only a veil for a much larger and more dangerous one: a world where the captain of the football team is a werewolf and the girl he has a crush on goes out at night to stake the undead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before he can even learn the rules of this new world, his fellow students are turning into flesh eating zombies. And he’s next on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if starting high school isn't hard enough. . .now Nick has to hide his new friends from his mom, his chainsaw from the principal, and keep the zombies and the demon Simi from eating his brains, all without getting grounded or suspended. How in the world is he supposed to do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bride McTierney has had it with men. They're cheap, self-centered, and never love her for who she is. But though she prides herself on being independent, deep down she still yearns for a knight in shining armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just never expected her knight in shining armor to have a shiny coat of fur...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly and tortured, Vane Kattalakis isn't what he seems. Most women lament that their boyfriends are dogs. In Bride's case, hers is a wolf. A Were-Hunter wolf. Wanted dead by his enemies, Vane isn't looking for a mate. But the Fates have marked Bride as his. Now he has three weeks to either convince Bride that the supernatural is real or he will spend the rest of his life neutered—something no self-respecting wolf can accept...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does a wolf convince a human to trust him with her life when his enemies are out to end his? In the world of the Were-Hunters, it really is dog-eat-dog. And only one alpha male can win.</description>

  <description>Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior with a useful but extremely aggravating power—amnesia. No one who meets him in person can remember him 5 minutes later. It makes it easy to have one-night stands, but hard to have a meaningful relationship, and without true love he can never regain his soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he finally meets Cassandra, the one woman who can remember him, she turns out to be the princess of the cursed race he's sworn to hunt—and forbidden to him. The two of them must face ancient curses, prophecies, and the direct meddling of the Greek gods to find true happiness at last.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is great for me. I have my chicory coffee, my warm beignets, and my best friend on the cell phone. Once the sun goes down, I am the baddest thing prowling the night: I command the elements, and I know no fear. For centuries, I've protected the innocent and watched over the mankind, making sure they are safe in a world where nothing is ever certain. All I want in return is a hot babe in a red dress, who wants nothing more from me then one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I get a runaway Mardi Gras float that tries to turn me into roadkill and a beautiful woman who saves my life but can't remember where she put my pants. Flamboyant and extravagant, Sunshine Runningwolf should be the perfect woman for me. She wants nothing past tonight, no ties, no long-term commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every time I look at her, I start yearning for dreams that I buried centuries ago. With her unconventional ways and ability to baffle me, Sunshine is the one person I find myself needing. But for me to love her would mean her death. I am cursed never to know peace or happiness— not so long as my enemy waits in the night to destroy us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Talon of the Morrigantes</description>

  <description>NIGHT PLEASURES: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal? To journey through the night stalking the evil that preys on humans? To have unlimited wealth, unlimited power? That is my existence, and it is dark and dangerous. I play hero to thousands, but am known to none. And I love every minute of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought until one night when I woke up handcuffed to my worst nightmare: a conservative woman in a button-down shirt. Or in Amanda's case, buttoned all the way up to her chin. She's smart, sexy, witty, and wants nothing to do with the paranormal-in other words, me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My attraction to Amanda Devereaux goes against everything I stand for. Not to mention the last time I fell in love it cost me not only my human life, but also my very soul. Yet every time I look at her, I find myself wanting to try again. Wanting to believe that love and loyalty do exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more disturbing, I find myself wondering if there's any way a woman like Amanda can love a man whose battle scars run deep, and whose heart was damaged by a betrayal so savage that he's not sure it will ever beat again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyrian of Thrace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIGHT EMBRACE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is great for me. I have my chicory coffee, my warm beignets, and my best friend on the cell phone. Once the sun goes down, I am the baddest thing prowling the night: I command the elements, and I know no fear. For centuries, I've protected the innocent and watched over the mankind, making sure they are safe in a world where nothing is ever certain. All I want in return is a hot babe in a red dress, who wants nothing more from me then one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I get a runaway Mardi Gras float that tries to turn me into roadkill and a beautiful woman who saves my life but can't remember where she put my pants.

  <description>See original cover edition: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5597761-fantasy-lover" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being trapped in a bedroom with a woman is a grand thing. Being trapped in hundreds of bedrooms over two thousand years isn't. And being cursed into a book as a love-slave for eternity can ruin even a Spartan warrior's day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a love-slave, I know everything about women. How to touch them, how to savor them, and most of all, how to pleasure them. But when I was summoned to fulfill Grace Alexander's sexual fantasies, I found the first woman in history who saw me as a man with a tormented past. She alone bothered to take me out of the bedroom and onto the world. She taught me to love again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But I was not born to love. I was cursed to walk eternity alone. As a general, I had long ago accepted my sentence. Yet now I have found Grace--the one thing my wounded heart cannot survive without. Sure, love can heal all wounds, but can it break a two-thousand-year-old curse?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Julian of Macedon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>During Garrett Addison's first week on the job as a criminal investigator for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, his team is called out to a murder scene of a young girl. She's the third victim in a string of disappearances with one thing in common--a Polaroid photo of each victim left behind at the crime scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FBI is pulled into the case to help, and Garrett finds himself working with Special Agent Jordan Lambert, the woman he once loved. When yet another girl dies--number six--Garrett blames himself and believes he doesn't have what it takes to be an agent. What he'll discover is that, while he may be done with the killer, the killer is not done with him--or Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling and award-winning author Lisa Harris unveils an unforgettable story of a case that has haunted the public and law enforcement for more than a decade. Fans of the Nikki Boyd Files will thrill to finally discover what actually happened to Nikki's sister, Sarah. New readers will become instant fans after devouring this chilling tale.</description>

  <description>2017 RITA Award Finalist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She blames him for her brother's death. Can she let go of resentment and open her heart to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny Cartwright found it difficult to understand why her younger brother would choose to join a country singer’s band rather than return to Kings Meadow after college . . . and the separation strained their relationship. Then a car accident made certain her brother could never return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Reynolds has chased stardom in Nashville for more than a dozen years, but it remains out of his reach. After an accident kills his young drummer, Trevor goes to Kings Meadow to keep a promise—and perhaps to discover what truly matters in this life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together by circumstances, Penny and Trevor must learn to give and receive forgiveness. And if they do, perhaps something beautiful can rise from the ashes of heartbreak.</description>

  <description>Nikki Boyd's flight into Nashville was routine--up until the crash landing at the airport. When the dust settles, Nikki discovers that the woman who had been seated next to her on the plane is missing--and no one will admit she was ever there. Erika Hamilton had been flying to Nashville with an air marshal as a key witness in an upcoming grand jury trial. When she flees from the crash, is she running &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; trouble or straight into it? Before Nikki can even see her family, she and her team are pulled into a missing persons case where the motives are as unclear as the suspects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling and award-winning author Lisa Harris has planted danger around every turn in this can't-put-it-down thrill ride that will leave readers stunned.</description>

  <description>Champion backcountry snowboarder Gage Watson has left the limelight behind after the death of one of his fans. After being sued for negligence and stripped of his sponsorships, he's remade his life as a ski patrol in Montana's rugged mountains, as well as serving on the PEAK Rescue team. But he can't seem to find his footing--or forget the woman he loved, who betrayed him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senator and former attorney Ella Blair spends much of her time in the limelight as the second-youngest senator in the country. But she has a secret--one that cost Gage his career. More than anything, she wants to atone for her betrayal of him in the courtroom and find a way to help him put his career back on track. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella's brother goes missing on one of Glacier National Park's most dangerous peaks, Gage and his team are called in for the rescue. But Gage isn't so sure he wants to help the woman who destroyed his life. More, when she insists on joining the search, he'll have to keep her safe while finding her reckless brother, a recipe for disaster when a snowstorm hits the mountain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But old sparks relight as they search for the missing snowboarder--and suddenly, they are faced with emotions neither can deny. But when Ella's secret is revealed, can they learn to trust each other--even when disaster happens again?</description>

  <description>No one needs to push Nikki Boyd to excel on the Tennessee Missing Person Task Force. The case of her own missing sister, still unsolved after ten years, is the driving force in her work. When a Polaroid photo of a missing girl shows up at a crime scene, Nikki quickly recognizes similarities to the past. The closer she gets to the abductor, the more she feels that this case is getting personal, and that she is not the hunter at all--but actually the one being hunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this explosive first book in the new Nikki Boyd Files, Lisa Harris takes readers on a fast-paced pursuit of justice that will have them holding their breath until the heart-stopping finish.</description>

  <description>If you harbored a devastating secret, had given your solemn promise of silence… what would make you to break it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian Shaw can have anything he wants…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...except the woman he loves. After all, Sierra Rose is his amazing assistant, a woman who helps him hold his empire together, leaving him free to pursue his adventurous hobbies—his only distraction from his excruciating past… until now. But what if she is the one who can finally free him from his regrets? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sierra Rose harbors a terrible secret…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...the fact that Ian’s favorite niece and ward, Esme, just might elope with her less-than-awesome boyfriend. Sierra’s made a promise to Esme—but her first loyalty belongs to her boss Ian, the man she's admired for years. But letting herself fall in love with him risks the best job she’s ever had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When tragedy strikes, sparks ignite…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...because Esme has vanished. Ian fears the worst--has she run away with her boyfriend? Or, has something more sinister happened in the wilds of Glacier National Park? It's a race against time, with Sierra and Ian caught in the crossfire of secrets, regrets and what-ifs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exciting prequel to the Montana Rescue series! Get your copy today—and jumpstart your epic romantic adventure.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>A leather-bound journal. A single father. A woman in pursuit of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garner Bradford, heir to the troubled Bradford Shipping empire, doesn't know much about babies. But he's going to have to learn fast because he's just become a single father to his newborn daughter. As he confesses through his journal entries, he's not entirely sure how to keep a newborn alive, whether or not he'll ever patch together his shattered heart, or how to forgive himself for his mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Career girl Kathleen Burke is wholly uninterested in settling down. She has big dreams, and none of them include Garner and his small hometown in Washington State. Yet she can't seem to get her handsome boss out of her head or her heart. There's something extraordinarily tempting about his beautifully sad green eyes. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through journal entries, phone conversations, and letters, &lt;i&gt;Then Came You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a unique, heart-stirring romance novella by acclaimed author Becky Wade.</description>

  <description>When Maddy McKay and Quinn Holcombe don't show up for Quinn's surprise birthday party, his friends know that something is very wrong. Their search turns up little beyond evidence that Quinn and Maddy just decided to take off for a long overdue vacation. But it soon becomes apparent that they did not leave of their own accord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddy awakens in a cement room with no idea where she is. But it's not long before she realizes she's in the clutches of a madman exacting revenge by hunting. His prey of choice? Humans. Now Maddy and Quinn must run for their lives, hoping to find their killer before the next game begins. Because if they don't win this game, they die.</description>
