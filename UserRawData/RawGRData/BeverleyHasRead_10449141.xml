  <description>Smart, successful, and sitting pretty at the top of her game, Neera Malik has it all figured out. &lt;br /&gt;Save for the small issue of Gustavo Guillmand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The artist with a cult—and Instagram—following has a problem and it's not his preference for shirtless selfies. &lt;br /&gt;No, he has an attitude problem, a minding his own business problem, an infuriatingly sexy problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They can't stand each other and they can't stay away from each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This steamy enemies-to-lovers office romance originally appeared on the Read Me Romance podcast. This edition includes a seriously extended epilogue beyond the podcast content.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;An era-defining novel about the relationship between a fifteen-year-old girl and her teacher&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL HE DID WAS FALL IN LOVE WITH ME AND THE WORLD TURNED HIM INTO A MONSTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Wye was fifteen-years-old when she first had sex with her English teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is now thirty-two and in the storm of allegations against powerful men in 2017, the teacher, Jacob Strane, has just been accused of sexual abuse by another former student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanessa is horrified by this news, because she is quite certain that the relationship she had with Strane wasn't abuse. It was love. She's sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to rethink her past, to revisit everything that happened, Vanessa has to redefine the great love story of her life – her great sexual awakening – as rape. Now she must deal with the possibility that she might be a victim, and just one of many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuanced, uncomfortable, bold and powerful, and as riveting as it is disturbing, &lt;em&gt;My Dark Vanessa&lt;/em&gt; goes straight to the heart of some of the most complex issues our age is grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When strangers take part in a series of group suicides, everything suggests that a cult is to blame. How do you stop a cult when nobody knows they are a member?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine suicides&lt;br /&gt;One Cult&lt;br /&gt;No leader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people arrive one night on Chelsea Bridge. They’ve never met. But at the same time, they run, and leap to their deaths. Each of them received a letter in the post that morning, a pre-written suicide note, and a page containing only four words: Nothing important happened today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is how they knew they had been chosen to become a part of the People Of Choice: A mysterious suicide cult whose members have no knowledge of one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-two people on that train witness the event. Two of them will be next. By the morning, People Of Choice are appearing around the globe; it becomes a movement. A social media page that has lain dormant for four years suddenly has thousands of followers. The police are under pressure to find a link between the cult members, to locate a leader that does not seem to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you stop a cult when nobody knows they are a member?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shocking, mesmerisingly original and pitch-black thriller, &lt;i&gt;Nothing Important Happened Today&lt;/i&gt; confirms Will Carver as one of the most extraordinary, exciting authors in crime fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Until she knows her husband’s fate, she cannot decide her own...&lt;br /&gt; An epic debut novel of forbidden love, loss, and the shattered hearts left behind in the wake of World War I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1921. Families are desperately trying to piece together the fragments of their broken lives. While many survivors of the Great War have been reunited with their loved ones, Edie’s husband Francis has not come home. He is considered ‘missing in action’, but when Edie receives a mysterious photograph taken by Francis in the post, hope flares. And so she beings to search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Harry, Francis’s brother, fought alongside him. He too longs for Francis to be alive, so they can forgive each other for the last things they ever said. Both brothers shared a love of photography and it is that which brings Harry back to the Western Front. Hired by grieving families to photograph gravesites, as he travels through battle-scarred France gathering news for British wives and mothers, Harry also searches for evidence of his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And as Harry and Edie’s paths converge, they get closer to a startling truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An incredibly moving account of an often-forgotten moment in history, &lt;i&gt;The Photographer of the Lost&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the thousands of soldiers who were lost amid the chaos and ruins, and the even greater number of men and women desperate to find them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caroline Scott is a freelance writer and historian specializing in WWI and women’s history. &lt;i&gt;The Photographer of the Lost&lt;/i&gt;, partially inspired by her family history, is her first novel.</description>

  <description>Jason Arnopp - author of acclaimed cult hit The Last Days of Jack Sparks - returns with a razor-sharp thriller for a social-media obsessed world. Prepare to never look at your phone the same way again . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Collins has been ghosted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was supposed to be moving in with her new boyfriend Scott, but all she finds after relocating to Brighton is an empty apartment. Scott has vanished. His possessions have all disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for his mobile phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate knows she shouldn't hack into Scott's phone. She shouldn't look at his Tinder, his calls, his social media. But she can't quite help herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when the trouble starts. Strange, whispering phone calls from numbers she doesn't recognise. Scratch marks on the walls that she can't explain. And the growing feeling that she's being watched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate refuses to leave the apartment - she's not going anywhere until she's discovered what happened to Scott. But the deeper she dives into Scott's digital history the more Kate realises just how little she really knows about the man she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; The arrival of a meteorite in a small Finnish town causes chaos and crime in this poignant, chilling and hilarious new thriller from the King of Helsinki Noir&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man with dark thoughts on his mind is racing along the remote snowy roads of Hurmevaara in Finland, when there is flash in the sky and something crashes into the car. That something turns about to be a highly valuable meteorite. With euro signs lighting up the eyes of the locals, the unexpected treasure is temporarily placed in a neighbourhood museum, under the watchful eye of a priest named Joel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Joel has a lot more on his mind than simply protecting the riches that have apparently rained down from heaven. His wife has just revealed that she is pregnant. Unfortunately Joel has strong reason to think the baby isn’t his. As Joel tries to fend off repeated and bungled attempts to steal the meteorite, he must also come to terms with his own situation, and discover who the father of the baby really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transporting the reader to the culture, landscape and mores of northern Finland &lt;i&gt;Little Siberia&lt;/i&gt; is both a crime novel and a hilarious, blacker-than-black comedy about faith and disbelief, love and death, and what to do when bolts from the blue – both literal and figurative – turn your life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;All the Missing Girls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;You Will Know Me&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Impossible Causes&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping thriller about isolation, power, and the lies that fester when witnesses stay silent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For six months every year, Lark Island is fogged in, its occupants cut off completely from the mainland. The community is small, tight-knit, and deeply religious. Lark seems like a good place for 16-year-old Viola Kendrick and her mother to be alone as they mourn Viola’s father and brother, both killed in a tragic accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the islanders are hiding dark secrets. As the winter fog sets in, Viola gets to know the Eldest Girls—the only three teenagers on Lark—and begins to learn about the island’s twisted history, including an old story of a young girl, whose death the islanders insist was accidental. When a man’s body is found at the end of Viola’s first winter on Lark, Viola finds herself at the center of a murder mystery: one that asks whether the man’s death was a righteous act of revenge, or a cold-blooded killing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eerie and menacing, timely and moving, &lt;i&gt;Impossible Causes&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller that examines the consequences of secrets kept at young women’s expense.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond, from the author of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader, and soon Alice's greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who's never asked a man's permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to them--and to the men they love--becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, &lt;i&gt;The Giver of Stars&lt;/i&gt; is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic--a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.</description>

  <description>It should have been just a mid-life fling. A guilty indiscretion that Neve Connolly could have weathered. An escape from twenty years of routine marriage to her overworked husband, and from her increasingly distant children. But when Neve pays a morning-after visit to her lover, Saul, and finds him brutally murdered, their pied-à-terre still heady with her perfume, all the lies she has so painstakingly stitched together threaten to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scrubbing clean every trace of her existence from Saul’s life—and death—Neve believes she can return to normal, shaken but intact. But she can’t get out of her head the one tormenting question: what was she forgetting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An investigation into the slaying could provide the answer. It’s brought Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Hitching, and Neve’s worst fears, to her door. But with every new lie, every new misdirection to save herself, Neve descends further into the darkness of her betrayal—and into more danger than she ever imagined.

One careless remark at Johnny's birthday party, with the entire family present, starts Cara spilling out all their secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the subsequent unravelling, every one of the adults finds themselves wondering if it's time - finally - to grow up?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Internationally&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Mhairi McFarlane returns with another heartful romantic comedy perfect for fans of Josie Silver, Sophie Kinsella, or Sally Thorne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;If faking love is this easy... how do you know when it’s real? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her partner of over a decade suddenly ends things, Laurie is left reeling—not only because they work at the same law firm and she has to see him&lt;em&gt; every day&lt;/em&gt;. Her once perfect life is in shambles and the thought of dating again in the age of Tinder is nothing short of horrifying. When news of her ex’s pregnant girlfriend hits the office grapevine, taking the humiliation lying down is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an option. Then a chance encounter in a broken-down elevator with the office playboy opens up a new possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Carter doesn’t believe in love, but he needs a respectable, steady girlfriend to impress their bosses. Laurie wants a hot new man to give the rumor mill something else to talk about. It’s the perfect proposition: a fauxmance played out on social media, with strategically staged photographs and a specific end date in mind. With the plan hatched, Laurie and Jamie begin to flaunt their new couple status, to the astonishment—and jealousy—of their friends and colleagues. But there’s a fine line between pretending to be in love and actually falling for your charming, handsome &lt;em&gt;fake&lt;/em&gt; boyfriend...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Lexie loves her home. She feels safe and secure in it – and loved, thanks to her boyfriend Tom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recently, something’s not been quite right. A book out of place. A wardrobe door left open. A set of keys going missing…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom thinks Lexie’s going mad – but then, he’s away more often than he’s at home nowadays, so he wouldn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Lexie isn’t losing it. She knows there’s someone out there watching her. And, deep down, she knows there’s nothing she can do to make them stop…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One ordinary day. One extraordinary event. Their lives changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an ordinary Saturday morning in 1996, the residents of Nightingale Point wake up to their normal lives and worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary has a secret life that no one knows about, not even Malachi and Tristan, the brothers she vowed to look after.&lt;br /&gt;Malachi had to grow up too quickly. Between looking after Tristan and nursing a broken heart, he feels older than his twenty-one years.&lt;br /&gt;Tristan wishes Malachi would stop pining for Pamela. No wonder he's falling in with the wrong crowd, without Malachi to keep him straight.&lt;br /&gt;Elvis is trying hard to remember to the instructions his care worker gave him, but sometimes he gets confused and forgets things.&lt;br /&gt;Pamela wants to run back to Malachi but her overprotective father has locked her in and there's no way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a day like any other, until something extraordinary happens. When the sun sets, Nightingale Point is irrevocably changed and somehow, through the darkness, the residents must find a way back to lightness, and back to each other.</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The sensational new novel from the million-copy bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Miniaturist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Muse&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One winter's afternoon on Hampstead Heath in 1980, Elise Morceau meets Constance Holden and quickly falls under her spell. Connie is bold and alluring, a successful writer whose novel is being turned into a major Hollywood film. Elise follows Connie to LA, a city of strange dreams and swimming pools and late-night gatherings of glamorous people. But whilst Connie thrives on the heat and electricity of this new world where everyone is reaching for the stars and no one is telling the truth, Elise finds herself floundering. When she overhears a conversation at a party that turns everything on its head, Elise makes an impulsive decision that will change her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Rose Simmons is seeking answers about her mother, who disappeared when she was a baby. Having learned that the last person to see her was Constance Holden, a reclusive novelist who withdrew from public life at the peak of her fame, Rose is drawn to the door of Connie's imposing house in search of a confession . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the million-copy bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Miniaturist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Muse&lt;/i&gt;, this is a luminous, powerful and deeply moving novel about secrets and storytelling, motherhood and friendship, and how we lose and find ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thrilling tale of secretaries turned spies, of love and duty, and of sacrifice—inspired by the true story of the CIA plot to infiltrate the hearts and minds of Soviet Russia, not with propaganda, but with the greatest love story of the twentieth century: &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the height of the Cold War, two secretaries are pulled out of the typing pool at the CIA and given the assignment of a lifetime. Their mission: to smuggle &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt; out of the USSR, where no one dare publish it, and help Pasternak's magnum opus make its way into print around the world. Glamorous and sophisticated Sally Forrester is a seasoned spy who has honed her gift for deceit all over the world--using her magnetism and charm to pry secrets out of powerful men. Irina is a complete novice, and under Sally's tutelage quickly learns how to blend in, make drops, and invisibly ferry classified documents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Secrets We Kept &lt;/i&gt;combines a legendary literary love story—the decades-long affair between Pasternak and his mistress and muse, Olga Ivinskaya, who was sent to the Gulag and inspired Zhivago's heroine, Lara—with a narrative about two women empowered to lead lives of extraordinary intrigue and risk. From Pasternak's country estate outside Moscow to the brutalities of the Gulag, from Washington, D.C. to Paris and Milan, &lt;i&gt; The Secrets We Kept&lt;/i&gt; captures a watershed moment in the history of literature—told with soaring emotional intensity and captivating historical detail. And at the center of this unforgettable debut is the powerful belief that a piece of art can change the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1922, Paul Beckermann arrives at the Bauhaus art school and is immediately seduced by both the charismatic teaching and his fellow students. Eccentric and alluring, the more time Paul spends with his new friends the closer they become, and the deeper he falls in love with the mesmerising Charlotte. But Paul is not the only one vying for her affections, and soon an insidious rivalry takes root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As political tensions escalate in Germany, the Bauhaus finds itself under threat, and the group begins to disintegrate under the pressure of its own betrayals and love affairs. Decades later, in the wake of an unthinkable tragedy, Paul is haunted by a secret. When an old friend from the Bauhaus resurfaces, he must finally break his silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Mrs Hemingway&lt;/i&gt;, Naomi Wood's &lt;i&gt;The Hiding Game &lt;/i&gt;is a beautifully written, powerful and suspenseful novel about the dangerously fine line between love and obsession, set against the most turbulent era of our recent past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Brooke Markham needs a man. A real good man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she's not looking for a keeper. She's too busy kicking ass, running an empire, and caring for her ailing father to spend time with men who want annoying things like relationships and commitment and…conversation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brooke knows what she wants and it's not a future with the growly barkeep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JJ Harniczek needs money. A whole lot of money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's determined to launch his distillery, expand his tavern, and put Talbott's Cove on the foodie tourism map. But there's no way he's asking Brooke for a dime. Not before he takes her to bed and definitely not after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JJ knows where he's headed and the blonde bombshell isn't about to change that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not until she changes his entire world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The unexpected and forbidden affair between Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok unfolds in a triumph of historical fiction from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Away &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Lucky Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I never envied a wife or a husband, until I met Eleanor. Then, I would have traded everything I ever had, every limo ride, every skinny dip, every byline and carefree stroll, for what Franklin had, polio and all."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorena Hickok meets Eleanor Roosevelt in 1932 while reporting on Franklin Roosevelt's first presidential campaign. Having grown up worse than poor in South Dakota and reinvented herself as the most prominent woman reporter in America, "Hick," as she's known to her friends and admirers, is not quite instantly charmed by the idealistic, patrician Eleanor. But then, as her connection with the future first lady deepens into intimacy, what begins as a powerful passion matures into a lasting love, and a life that Hick never expected to have. She moves into the White House, where her status as "first friend" is an open secret, as are FDR's own lovers. After she takes a job in the Roosevelt administration, promoting and protecting both Roosevelts, she comes to know Franklin not only as a great president but as a complicated rival and an irresistible friend, capable of changing lives even after his death. Through it all, even as Hick's bond with Eleanor is tested by forces both extraordinary and common, and as she grows as a woman and a writer, she never loses sight of the love of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Washington, D.C. to Hyde Park, from a little white house on Long Island to an apartment on Manhattan's Washington Square, Amy Bloom's new novel moves elegantly through fascinating places and times, written in compelling prose and with emotional depth, wit, and acuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Amy Bloom knows the urgency of love," wrote &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;about Bloom's acclaimed bestseller &lt;i&gt;Away&lt;/i&gt;. The same could be said of &lt;i&gt;White Houses&lt;/i&gt;, an unforgettable novel about the power of passion and the endurance of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;White Houses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Amy Bloom illuminates one of the most intriguing relationships in history. Lorena Hickok is a woman who found love with another lost soul, Eleanor Roosevelt. And love is what this book is all about: It suffuses every page, so that by the time you reach the end, you are simply stunned by the beauty of the world these two carved out for themselves&lt;b&gt;."--Melanie Benjamin, author of &lt;i&gt;The Swans of Fifth Avenue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It seems a minor miracle, what Amy Bloom has done in &lt;i&gt;White Houses.&lt;/i&gt; In Lorena Hickok's unforgettable voice, she brings an untold slice of history so dazzlingly and devastatingly to life, it took my breath away. Easily, the most intimate, crackling, and expansive rendering of Eleanor Roosevelt in print, and, more than this, a dizzyingly beautiful tale of what it means to be human, and what it is to love."&lt;b&gt;--Paula McLain, author of &lt;i&gt;The Paris Wife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;**LONGLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2018**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An elegiac novel set in post-WW2 London about memory, family secrets and lies, from the internationally acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The English Patient&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1945, and London is still reeling from the Blitz. 14-year-old Nathaniel and his sister, Rachel, are apparently abandoned by their parents, left in the care of an enigmatic figure named The Moth. They suspect he might be a criminal, and grow both more convinced and less concerned as they get to know his eccentric crew of friends: men and women all who seem determined to protect Rachel and Nathaniel. But are they really what and who they claim to be? A dozen years later, Nathaniel journeys through recollection, reality and imagination to uncover all he didn’t know or understand in that time, to piece together a story that feels something like the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; ‘A novel of shadowy brilliance’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Fiction as rich, as beautiful, as melancholy as life itself, written in the visionary language of memory’ &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Ondaatje brilliantly threads the mysteries and disguises and tangled loyalties and personal yearnings of the secret world... I haven’t read a better novel this year’&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it—teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy’s sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it’s naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way—a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they’re alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn’t give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she’s going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she’s built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can’t beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson’s trademark humor, Never Have I Ever explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If you could do it all over again, would you? &lt;i&gt;Should&lt;/i&gt; you? One man finds out in this finely observed, compulsively readable, and occasionally raunchy novel of marriage, sex, and dating for readers of Jonathan Franzen, Lauren Groff, and Tom Perrotta.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently separated Toby Fleishman is suddenly, somehow--and at age forty-one, short as ever--surrounded by women who want him: women who are self-actualized, women who are smart and interesting, women who don't mind his height, women who are eager to take him for a test drive with just the swipe of an app. Toby doesn't mind being used in this way; it's a welcome change from the thirteen years he spent as a married man, the thirteen years of emotional neglect and contempt he's just endured. Anthropologically speaking, it's like nothing he ever experienced before, particularly back in the 1990s, when he first began dating and became used to swimming in the murky waters of rejection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Toby's new life--liver specialist by day, kids every other weekend, rabid somewhat anonymous sex at night--is interrupted when his ex-wife suddenly disappears. Either on a vision quest or a nervous breakdown, Toby doesn't know--she won't answer his texts or calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Toby's ex just angry, like always? Is she punishing him, yet again, for not being the bread winner she was? As he desperately searches for her while juggling his job and parenting their two unraveling children, Toby is forced to reckon with the real reasons his marriage fell apart, and to ask if the story he has been telling himself all this time is true.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;i&gt; comes another page-turning look inside one family’s past as buried secrets threaten to come to light. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you let in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Family Upstairs, the master of “bone-chilling suspense” (People) brings us the can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.</description>

  <description>In a dark and brilliant guessing game of a novel, Peter Swanson once again displays his unique gift for reprising and refreshing mystery writing’s greatest tropes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his college graduation, Harry is called home by his step-mother Alice, to their house on the Maine coast, following the unexpected death of his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who really is Alice, his father's much younger second wife? In a brilliant split narrative, Peter Swanson teases out the stories and damage that lie in her past. And as her story entwines with Harry’s in the present, things grow increasingly dark and threatening – will Harry be able to see any of it clearly through his own confused feelings?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How much can a family forgive?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A profoundly moving novel about two neighboring families in a suburban town, the bond between their children, a tragedy that reverberates over four decades, the daily intimacies of marriage, and the power of forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francis Gleeson and Brian Stanhope, two rookie cops in the NYPD, live next door to each other outside the city. What happens behind closed doors in both houses—the loneliness of Francis’s wife, Lena, and the instability of Brian’s wife, Anne—sets the stage for the explosive events to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ask Again, Yes&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply affecting exploration of the lifelong friendship and love that blossoms between Francis and Lena’s daughter, Kate, and Brian and Anne’s son, Peter. Luminous, heartbreaking, and redemptive, &lt;i&gt;Ask Again, Yes&lt;/i&gt; reveals the way childhood memories change when viewed from the distance of adulthood—villains lose their menace and those who appeared innocent seem less so. Kate and Peter’s love story, while tested by echoes from the past, is marked by tenderness, generosity, and grace.</description>

  <description>One life-changing summer&lt;br /&gt;Charlie meets Fran...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1997, Charlie Lewis is the kind of boy you don't remember in the school photograph. His exams have not gone well. At home he is looking after his father, when surely it should be the other way round, and if he thinks about the future at all, it is with a kind of dread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Fran Fisher bursts into his life and despite himself, Charlie begins to hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if Charlie wants to be with Fran, he must take on a challenge that could lose him the respect of his friends and require him to become a different person. He must join the Company. And if the Company sounds like a cult, the truth is even more appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of hope, it seems, is Shakespeare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant, funny, enchanting, devastating, Sweet Sorrow is a tragicomedy about the rocky path to adulthood and the confusion of family life, a celebration of the reviving power of friendship and that brief, searing explosion of first love that can only be looked at directly after it has burned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Such a beautiful book. Captures perfectly a moment in time we've all experienced.' Graham Norton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'He's such a genius. His novels are relatable and recognizable, but also surprising, breath-taking and life-enhancing' Nina Stibbe</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling, razor-sharp debut novel about a woman whose obsession with the beautiful actress on her block drives her to the edge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve never crossed their little fenced-in garden, of course. I stand on the sidewalk in front of the fern-and-ivy-filled planter that hangs from the fence—placed there as a sort of screen, I’m sure—and have a direct line of view into the kitchen at night. I’m grateful they’ve never thought to install blinds. That’s how confident they are. No one would dare stand in front of our house and watch us, they think. And they’re probably right: except for me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this taut and thrilling debut, an unraveling woman, unhappily childless and recently separated, becomes fixated on her neighbor—the &lt;i&gt;actress. &lt;/i&gt;The unnamed narrator can’t help noticing with wry irony that, though she and the actress live just a few doors apart, a chasm of professional success and personal fulfillment lies between them. The actress, a celebrity with her face on the side of every bus, shares a gleaming brownstone with her handsome husband and their three adorable children, while the narrator, working in a dead-end job, lives in a run-down, three-story walk-up with her ex-husband’s cat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an interaction with the actress at the annual block party takes a disastrous turn, what began as an innocent preoccupation spirals quickly, and lethally, into a frightening and irretrievable madness. Searing and darkly witty, &lt;i&gt;Looker &lt;/i&gt;is enormously entertaining—at once a propulsive Hitchcockian thriller and a fearlessly original portrait of the perils of envy.</description>

  <description>The revered &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author returns with a novel set in 1960s Baltimore that combines modern psychological insights with elements of classic noir, about a middle-aged housewife turned aspiring reporter who pursues the murder of a forgotten young woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline "Maddie" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Star.&lt;/em&gt; Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleo Sherwood was a young African-American woman who liked to have a good time. No one seems to know or care why she was killed except Maddie--and the dead woman herself. Maddie's going to find the truth about Cleo's life and death. Cleo's ghost, privy to Maddie's poking and prying, wants to be left alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie's investigation brings her into contact with people that used to be on the periphery of her life--a jewelery store clerk, a waitress, a rising star on the Baltimore Orioles, a patrol cop, a hardened female reporter, a lonely man in a movie theater. But for all her ambition and drive, Maddie often fails to see the people right in front of her. Her inability to look beyond her own needs will lead to tragedy and turmoil for all sorts of people--including the man who shares her bed, a black police officer who cares for Maddie more than she knows.</description>

  <description>A vicious assault. A devastating accusation. Who should she trust, her husband or her best friend?&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be the perfect reunion: six university friends together again after twenty years. Host Ali finally has the life she always wanted, a career she can be proud of and a wonderful family with her college boyfriend, now husband. But that night her best friend makes an accusation so shocking that nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Karen staggers in from the garden, bleeding and traumatised, she claims that she has been assaulted—by Ali’s husband, Mike. Ali must make a split-second decision: who should she believe? Her horrified husband, or her best friend? With Mike offering a very different version of events, Ali knows one of them is lying—but which? And why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ensuing chaos forces her to re-examine the golden era the group shared at university, Ali realises there are darker memories too. Memories that have lain dormant for decades. Memories someone would kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>‘Welcome to the escape room. Your goal is simple. Get out alive.’ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the lucrative world of Wall Street finance, Vincent, Jules, Sylvie and Sam are the ultimate high-flyers. Ruthlessly ambitious, they make billion-dollar deals and live lives of outrageous luxury. Getting rich is all that matters, and they'll do anything to get ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the four of them become trapped in an elevator escape room, things start to go horribly wrong. They have to put aside their fierce office rivalries and work together to solve the clues that will release them. But in the confines of the elevator the dark secrets of their team are laid bare. They are made to answer for profiting from a workplace where deception, intimidation and sexual harassment thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempers fray and the escape room’s clues turn more and more ominous, leaving the four of them dangling on the precipice of disaster. If they want to survive, they’ll have to solve one final puzzle: which one of them is a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Fantastic – one of my favorite books of the year.' Lee Child</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Desire as we’ve never seen it before: a riveting true story about the sex lives of three real American women, based on nearly a decade of reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts and destroys our lives. It’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt;, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.</description>

  <description>Every year, on the same night in July, a woman is taken from the streets of London; snatched by a killer who moves through the city like a ghost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie has a secret. On the morning of her tenth birthday, four bombs were detonated across the capital. That night her dad came home covered in blood. She thought he was hurt in the attacks - but then her sister Jessie found a missing woman's purse hidden in his room. Jessie says they mustn't tell. She says there's nothing to worry about. But when she takes a job looking after the woman's baby daughter, Addie starts to realise that her big sister doesn't always tell her the whole story. And that the secrets they're keeping may start costing lives...</description>

  <description>Hannah, Cate and Lissa are young, vibrant and inseparable. Living on the edge of a common in East London, their shared world is ablaze with art and activism, romance and revelry – and the promise of everything to come. They are electric. They are the best of friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years on, they are not where they hoped to be. Amidst flailing careers and faltering marriages, each hungers for what the others have. And each wrestles with the same question: what does it take to lead a meaningful life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXPECTATION&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is a novel of the highs and lows of friendship – how it can dip, dive and rise again. It is also about finding your way: as a mother, a daughter, a wife, a rebel. Most of all, it explores that liminal space between expectation and reality, the place – full of dreams, desires and pain – in which we all live our lives. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>You just dropped off your child at the bus stop. A panicked stranger calls your phone. Your child has been kidnapped, and the stranger explains that their child has also been kidnapped, by a completely different stranger. The only way to get your child back is to kidnap another child within 24 hours. Your child will be released only when the next victim's parents kidnap yet another child, and most importantly, the stranger explains, if you don't kidnap a child, or if the next parents don't kidnap a child, your child will be murdered. You are now part of The Chain.</description>

  <description>A dazzling, multigenerational novel in which the four adult daughters of a Chicago couple--still madly in love after forty years--recklessly ignite old rivalries until a long-buried secret threatens to shatter the lives they've built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Marilyn Connolly and David Sorenson fall in love in the 1970s, they are blithely ignorant of all that's to come. By 2016, their four radically different daughters are each in a state of unrest: Wendy, widowed young, soothes herself with booze and younger men; Violet, a litigator-turned-stay-at-home-mom, battles anxiety and self-doubt when the darkest part of her past resurfaces; Liza, a neurotic and newly tenured professor, finds herself pregnant with a baby she's not sure she wants by a man she's not sure she loves; and Grace, the dawdling youngest daughter, begins living a lie that no one in her family even suspects. Above it all, the daughters share the lingering fear that they will never find a love quite like their parents'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel moves through the tumultuous year following the arrival of Jonah Bendt--given up by one of the daughters in a closed adoption fifteen years before--we are shown the rich and varied tapestry of the Sorensons' past: years marred by adolescence, infidelity, and resentment, but also the transcendent moments of joy that make everything else worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning nearly half a century, and set against the quintessential American backdrop of Chicago and its prospering suburbs, Lombardo's debut explores the triumphs and burdens of love, the fraught tethers of parenthood and sisterhood, and the baffling mixture of affection, abhorrence, resistance, and submission we feel for those closest to us. In painting this luminous portrait of a family's becoming, Lombardo joins the ranks of writers such as Celeste Ng, Elizabeth Strout, and Jonathan Franzen as visionary chroniclers of our modern lives.</description>

  <description>Un campus prestigioso cristallizzato sotto la neve. Tre amici legati da un tragico segreto. Una ragazza portata via nella notte. Costa Azzurra, inverno del 1992. In una notte glaciale, mentre il campus del suo liceo è paralizzato da una tempesta di neve, Vinca Rockwell, diciannove anni, una delle studentesse più brillanti dell'ultimo anno, fugge insieme al suo professore di filosofia, con il quale aveva una relazione segreta. Per la ragazza "l'amore è tutto o niente". Nessuno la rivedrà mai più. Costa Azzurra, primavera del 2017. Fino alla fine del liceo erano inseparabili, ma da allora Fanny, Thomas e Maxime - i migliori amici di Vinca non si sono più rivolti la parola. Si ritrovano ora a una riunione di ex alunni. Venticinque anni prima, in terribili circostanze, hanno tutti e tre commesso un omicidio, murando il cadavere nella palestra della scuola. Proprio la palestra che oggi deve essere demolita per fare spazio a un altro edificio. D'ora in poi, niente potrà più impedire che la verità sul caso di Vinca venga a galla. Sconvolgente, dolorosa, demoniaca.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Time to come out of hibernation...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia Penton has been hibernating for years, it's no wonder she's a little prickly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia lives alone, dedicating herself to her job at the local university. On weekends, she helps out at a local hedgehog sanctuary because it gives her something to talk about on Mondays - and it makes people think she's nicer than she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Sylvia has a secret: she's been in love with her boss, Professor Lomax, for over a decade now, and she's sure he's just waiting for the right time to leave his wife. Meanwhile she stores every crumb of his affection and covertly makes trouble for anyone she feels gets in his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a bright new PhD candidate catches the Professor’s eye, Sylvia’s dreams of the fairy tale ending she has craved for so long, are soon in tatters, driving her to increasingly desperate measures and an uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia might have been sleep walking through her life but things are about to change now she’s woken up…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quirky, charming uplifting novel perfect for fans of Gail Honeyman's &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine &lt;/i&gt;and Sarah Haywood's &lt;i&gt;The Cactus&lt;/i&gt;. The feelgood bestseller about unrequited love, loneliness and the redemptive qualities of hedgehogs featuring the most unlikely heroine of 2019.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT READERS ARE SAYING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'An eccentrically heartwarming tale of steeping out of your comfort zone. I was rooting for Sylvia' &lt;/b&gt;- Lottie, Netgalley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'I was charmed by this tale. A feel-good book' &lt;/b&gt;- Heather, Netgalley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'A lovely story with delightful characters. Would highly recommend, especially if you are a fan of Ruth Hogan and Gail Honeyman' &lt;/b&gt;- Mary, Netgalley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'An absolutely superb novel about someone who is dissatisfied with her life but feels it's difficult to change. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes a quirky novel to entertain them' &lt;/b&gt;- Sue, Netgalley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Oh how I adored this book which is reminiscent of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt;' &lt;/b&gt;- Justine, Netgalley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'I like a book that makes me feel uplifted, that soothes the soul, and this book certainly did that. Sylvia is definitely one of my favourite fictional characters' &lt;/b&gt;- Joanne, Netgalley</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A layered and thrilling suspense novel that grapples with how to live as a woman in the modern world - or in the pages of a book - when the stakes are dangerously high.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young writer accepts a job at a university in the remote countryside, it’s meant to be a fresh start, away from the big city and the scene of a violent assault she’s desperate to forget. But despite the distractions of a new life and single motherhood, her nerves continue to jangle. To make matters worse, a vicious debate about violence against women inflames the tensions and mounting rivalries in her creative writing group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a troubled student starts sending in chapters from his novel that blur the lines between fiction and reality, the professor recognises herself as the main character in his book - and he has written her a horrific fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she be able to stop life imitating art before it's too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;At once a breathless battle-of-wits and a disarming exploration of sexual politics, &lt;i&gt;The Body Lies&lt;/i&gt; is an essential book for our times.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;___________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Gripping and strange in the best possible way: the perfect marriage of risky literary fiction and full-on thriller' MARIA SEMPLE, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Where d'ya go Bernadette?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Augusta Hope has never felt like she fits in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;At six, she’s memorising the dictionary. At seven, she’s correcting her teachers. At eight, she spins the globe and picks her favourite country on the sound of its name: &lt;em&gt;Burundi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And now that she's an adult, Augusta has no interest in the goings-on of the small town where she lives with her parents and her beloved twin sister, Julia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an unspeakable tragedy upends everything in Augusta's life, she's propelled headfirst into the unknown. She's determined to find where she belongs – but what if her true home, and heart, are half a world away?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Strangers living worlds apart.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Strangers with nothing in common.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;But it wasn't always that way...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry Hayes is single mum, living on a tough south London estate. She provides for her son by cleaning houses she could never hope to afford. Taken into care as a child, Kerry cannot ever forget her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah Martineau is a successful barrister with a beautiful wife, daughter and home in fashionable Primrose Hill. Adopted as a child, Noah always looks forward, never back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kerry reaches out to the sibling she lost on the day they were torn apart as children, she sets in motion a chain of events that will have life-changing consequences for them both. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<a target="_blank" href="https://beverleyhasread.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">https://beverleyhasread.wordpress.com/</a><br /><br />Oooh boy. This is a tough book to review. I have a policy of only reviewing books that are 3 stars and above and this just fell into the 3 star bracket. I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t love it either. In fact, to be honest, I didn’t get it.<br /><br />It wasn’t what I thought it would be,...</a>]]>

  <description>'We're spies,' said Lamb. 'All kinds of outlandish shit goes on.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the ringing of a dead man's phone, or an unwelcome guest at a funeral . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Slough House memories are stirring, all of them bad. Catherine Standish is buying booze again, Louisa Guy is raking over the ashes of lost love, and new recruit Lech Wicinski, whose sins make him outcast even among the slow horses, is determined to discover who destroyed his career, even if he tears his life apart in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in Regent's Park, Diana Taverner's tenure as First Desk is running into difficulties. If she's going to make the Service fit for purpose, she might have to make deals with a familiar old devil . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with winter taking its grip Jackson Lamb would sooner be left brooding in peace, but even he can't ignore the dried blood on his carpets. So when the man responsible breaks cover at last, Lamb sends the slow horses out to even the score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, they're heading into joe country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they're not all coming home.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'We lost all three girls that summer. Let them slip away like the words of some half-remembered song and when one came back, she wasn't the one we were trying to recall to begin with.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Tikka Molloy's recounting of the summer of 1992 - the summer the Van Apfel sisters, Hannah, the beautiful Cordelia and Ruth - disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven and one-sixth years old, Tikka is the precocious narrator of this fabulously endearing coming-of-age story, set in an eerie Australian river valley suburb with an unexplained stench. The Van Apfel girls vanish from the valley during the school's 'Showstopper' concert, held at the outdoor amphitheatre by the river. While the search for the sisters unites the small community on Sydney's urban fringe, the mystery of their disappearance remains unsolved forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly observed, sharp, lively, funny and entirely endearing, this novel is part mystery, part coming-of-age story - and quintessentially Australian. Think &lt;i&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Jasper Jones&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Picnic at Hanging Rock&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Norwegian Anne Tyler makes her English debut in a beautiful, bittersweet novel of rich insights and extraordinary perception, as a family drama creates a quiet earthquake…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘The most beautiful, elegant writing I’ve read in a long time. If you love Anne Tyler, you will ADORE this’ &lt;b&gt;Joanna Cannon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘Absolutely loved its quiet, insightful generosity’ &lt;b&gt;Claire King&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Liv, Ellen and Håkon, along with their partners and children, arrive in Rome to celebrate their father’s seventieth birthday, a quiet earthquake occurs: their parents have decided to divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Shocked and disbelieving, the siblings try to come to terms with their parents’ decision as it echoes through the homes they have built for themselves, and forces them to reconstruct the shared narrative of their childhood and family history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A bittersweet novel of regret, relationships and rare psychological insights, &lt;i&gt;A Modern Family&lt;/i&gt; encourages us to look at the people closest to us a little more carefully, and ultimately reveals that it’s never too late for change…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘It is the most satisfying book that I’ve read in a long time, and the most clear-eyed, honest, yet sympathetic examination of relationships that I have ever read. The subtlety with which she portrays the inconsistencies between how the characters see each other versus how they see themselves is masterful’ &lt;b&gt;Sara Taylor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘There is a hint of Ingmar Bergman in this portrayal of a completely normal family, it delves deep and wrenches your heart’ &lt;b&gt;Adresseavisen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘Completely gripping in its intimacy, it's a really deep delve into relationships but also a stark dissection of the illusions we rely on about who we are. Another hit from Orenda Books’ &lt;b&gt;Live Many Lives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘A beautifully written and highly thought-provoking literary novel exploring the psychology and practicalities of marriage, commitment and individuality … There’s so much bubbling under the surface here, revealing not only how much the characters DO know about each other, but also how much they DON’T, plus all of the secrets they’ve been trying to hide. &lt;i&gt;A Modern Family&lt;/i&gt; is honest and brutal – family life laid bare, down to its deepest foundations’ &lt;b&gt;Off-the-Shelf Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘Flatland writes with an elegance that one just savours with the greatest of delight. There's also subtle humour and a shrewd and insightful examination of the psychology of family, and of loss. &lt;i&gt;A Modern Family&lt;/i&gt; is not just good, it is masterful. It is fresh and original, with a depth of vision that is breath taking. Expertly translated by Rosie Hedger, I have no doubt that this novel will feature in my best of the year list’ &lt;b&gt;Random Things Through My Letterbox&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE NORWEGIAN BOOKSELLERS’ AWARD&lt;/b&gt;</description>

I do love a crime novel set in northern Europe, I am a huge fan and regularly read and recommend, but I was interested in what modern literature outside of the crime genre would be like.

  <description>On Halloween night, four households gather for a party in the tiny Yorkshire village of Black Gale. Three hours in, they head outside, onto the darkened moors, to play a drunken game of hide and seek. None of them return. There's no trail, no evidence and no answers. An entire village has just vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the police investigation dead in the water, the families of the disappeared ask missing persons investigator David Raker to find out what happened. But nothing can prepare him for the truth.</description>

  <description>Those Who Are Loved is set against the backdrop of the German occupation of Greece, the subsequent civil war and a military dictatorship, all of which left deep scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Themis is part of a family bitterly divided by politics and, as a young woman, her fury with those who have collaborated with the Nazis, drives her to fight for the communists. She is eventually imprisoned on the notorious islands of exile, Makronisos and Trikeri, and has to make a life or death decision. She is proud of having fought, but for the rest of her life is haunted by some of her actions. Forty years after the end of the civil war, she finally achieves catharsis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Hislop sheds light on the complexity of Greece’s traumatic past and weaves it into the dynamic tale of a woman who is both hero and villain, and her lifelong fight for justice.</description>

  <description>Lucy is lost. Growing up in the north east she wanted more. When others were thinking about the Nissan factory or call centres she was thinking about Pete Doherty, poetry and the possibilities London seemed to offer. University was the way out, her ticket to the promised land – where she’d become a shinier version of herself, where her nights would be gigs and parties and long exciting conversations about Judith Butler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once she gets there Lucy can’t help feeling that the big city isn’t for her, and once again she is striving, only this time it’s for the right words, the right clothes, the right foods. No matter what she tries she’s not right. Until she is. In that last year of her degree the city opens up to her, she is saying the right things, doing the right things. Until her parents visit for her graduation and events show her that her life has always been about pretending and now she’s lost all sense of who she is and what she’s supposed to be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so Lucy packs up her things and leaves again, this time for her dead Irish grandfather’s stone cottage in a remote part of Donegal. There, alone, she sets about piecing together her history hoping that in confronting where she came from she will know where she should be going. Saltwater is a novel about growing up, about class, about how where we come from shapes who we become, and about the aimless periods we all go through. And it’s about the north east, mothers and daughters, history and pre-destiny.</description>

Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other.

  <description>In the north of England, far from the intrusions of cities but not far from civilization, Silvie and her family are living as if they are ancient Britons, surviving by the tools and knowledge of the Iron Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two weeks, the length of her father's vacation, they join an anthropology course set to reenact life in simpler times. They are surrounded by forests of birch and rowan; they make stew from foraged roots and hunted rabbit. The students are fulfilling their coursework; Silvie's father is fulfilling his lifelong obsession. He has raised her on stories of early man, taken her to witness rare artifacts, recounted time and again their rituals and beliefs—particularly their sacrifices to the bog. Mixing with the students, Silvie begins to see, hear, and imagine another kind of life, one that might include going to university, traveling beyond England, choosing her own clothes and food, speaking her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ancient Britons built ghost walls to ward off enemy invaders, rude barricades of stakes topped with ancestral skulls. When the group builds one of their own, they find a spiritual connection to the past. What comes next but human sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story at once mythic and strikingly timely, Sarah Moss's &lt;i&gt;Ghost Wall &lt;/i&gt;urges us to wonder how far we have come from the "primitive minds" of our ancestors.</description>

  <description>Children are dying on London's streets. Frankie Reece, stabbed through the heart, outside a corner shop. Others recruited from care homes, picked up and exploited; passed like gifts between gangs. They are London's lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Raphaela Belsham is killed. She's thirteen years old, her father is a man of influence, from a smart part of town. And she's white. Suddenly, the establishment is taking notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DS Noah Jake is determined to handle Raphaela's case and Frankie's too. But he's facing his own turmoil, and it's becoming an obsession. DI Marnie Rome is worried, and she needs Noah on side. Because more children are disappearing, more are being killed by the day and the swelling tide of violence needs to be stemmed before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER BE BROKEN is a stunning, intelligent and gripping novel which explores how the act of witness alters us, and reveals what lies beneath the veneer of a glittering city.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A delicious dark, relentless and chilling psychological thriller by the international bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The harrowing plot keeps you gripped until the final, devastating revelation’ &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunday Mirror&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Shields is a moody, acerbic probation offer, dealing with some of Glasgow’s worst cases, and her job is on the line.&lt;br /&gt;Liam Macdowall was imprisoned for murdering his wife, and he’s published a series of letters to the dead woman, in a book that makes him an unlikely hero – and a poster boy for Men’s Rights activists.&lt;br /&gt;Liam is released on licence into Mary’s care, but things are far from simple. Mary develops a poisonous obsession with Liam and his world, and when her son and Liam’s daughter form a relationship, Mary will stop at nothing to impose her own brand of justice … with devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;A heart-pounding, relentless and chilling psychological thriller, rich with deliciously dark and unapologetic humour, &lt;i&gt;Worst Case Scenario&lt;/i&gt; is also a perceptive, tragic and hugely relevant book by one of the most exciting names in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Tyler lives in one of Edinburgh’s most deprived areas. Coerced into robbing rich people’s homes by his bullying older siblings, he’s also trying to care for his little sister and his drug-addict mum. On a job, his brother Barry stabs a homeowner and leaves her for dead, but that’s just the beginning of their nightmare, because the woman is the wife of Edinburgh’s biggest crime lord, Deke Holt. With the police and the Holts closing in, and his shattered family in devastating danger, Tyler meets posh girl Flick in another stranger’s house, and he thinks she may just be his salvation . . . unless he drags her down, too. A pulsating, tense psychological thriller, &lt;i&gt;Breakers&lt;/i&gt; is also a breathtakingly brutal, beautiful, and deeply moving story of a good kid in the wrong family, from one of Scotland’s finest crime writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'Mesmerising, compulsive, deliciously dark - and so good on the complex and thorny bond between friends. Kate Hamer's writing is incandescent.' Lucy Foley, author of &lt;i&gt;The Hunting Party&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe stands on Pulteney Bridge, tights gashed from toe to thigh. The shock of mangled metal and blood-stained walls flashes through her mind as she tries to cover her face so she won't be recognised. It wouldn't do to be spotted looking like this. She's missing a shoe. She feels sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe thought murder and murder happened. &lt;i&gt;Thoughts are just thoughts&lt;/i&gt;, they said&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Now she knows they were wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, Phoebe arranges the scissors and knives so they point toward her mother's room. She is exhausted, making sure there's no trace of herself - not a single hair, not even her scent - left anywhere in the house. She must not let her thoughts unravel, because if they do, there's no telling who might be caught in the crossfire, and Phoebe will have to live with the consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this stunning debut novel, a young woman tells the story behind two elderly sisters’ estrangement, unraveling family secrets stretching back a century and across the Atlantic to early 20th century Italy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Stella Fortuna, death has always been a part of life. Stella’s childhood is full of strange, life-threatening incidents—moments where ordinary situations like cooking eggplant or feeding the pigs inexplicably take lethal turns. Even Stella’s own mother is convinced that her daughter is cursed or haunted.&lt;br /&gt;In her rugged Italian village, Stella is considered an oddity—beautiful and smart, insolent and cold. Stella uses her peculiar toughness to protect her slower, plainer baby sister Tina from life’s harshest realities. But she also provokes the ire of her father Antonio: a man who demands subservience from women and whose greatest gift to his family is his absence.&lt;br /&gt;When the Fortunas emigrate to America on the cusp of World War II, Stella and Tina must come of age side-by-side in a hostile new world with strict expectations for each of them. Soon Stella learns that her survival is worthless without the one thing her family will deny her at any cost: her independence.&lt;br /&gt;In present-day Connecticut, one family member tells this heartrending story, determined to understand the persisting rift between the now-elderly Stella and Tina. A richly told debut, &lt;i&gt;The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of family transgressions as ancient and twisted as the olive branch that could heal them.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>In 1998, a sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on school property, dressed in white and posed on a swing, with no known cause of death. The novel opens with this image, as related to us by the narrator, Violet, looking back on the night it happened from the present day, before returning to relate the series of events leading up to the girl’s murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an accident involving her Dad and sister, Violet joins Elm Hollow Academy, a private girls school in a quiet coastal town, which has an unpleasant history as the site of famous 17th century witch trials. Violet quickly finds herself invited to become the fourth member of an advanced study group, alongside Robin, Grace, and Alex - led by their charismatic art teacher, Annabel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Annabel claims her classes aren’t related to ancient rites and rituals - warning the girls off the topic, describing it as little more than mythology - the girls start to believe that magic is real, and that they can harness it. But when the body of a former member of the society - Robin’s best friend, with whom Violet shares an uncanny resemblance - is found dead on campus nine months after she disappeared, Violet begins to wonder whether she can trust her friends, teachers, or even herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mesmerizing debut novel by Chip Cheek, &lt;i&gt;Cape May&lt;/i&gt; explores the social and sexual mores of 1950s America through the eyes of a newly married couple from the genteel south corrupted by sophisticated New England urbanites.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late September 1957. Henry and Effie, very young newlyweds from Georgia, arrive in Cape May, New Jersey, for their honeymoon only to find the town is deserted. Feeling shy of each other and isolated, they decide to cut the trip short. But before they leave, they meet a glamorous set of people who sweep them up into their drama. Clara, a beautiful socialite who feels her youth slipping away; Max, a wealthy playboy and Clara’s lover; and Alma, Max’s aloof and mysterious half-sister, to whom Henry is irresistibly drawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The empty beach town becomes their playground, and as they sneak into abandoned summer homes, go sailing, walk naked under the stars, make love, and drink a great deal of gin, Henry and Effie slip from innocence into betrayal, with irrevocable consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic and moving, this is a novel about marriage, love and sexuality, and the lifelong repercussions that meeting a group of debauched cosmopolitans has on a new marriage.</description>

  <description>Even the prickliest cactus has its flower. For Susan Green, messy emotions don't fit into the equation of her perfectly ordered life. She has a flat that is ideal for one, a job that suits her passion for logic, and an "interpersonal arrangement" that provides cultural and other, more intimate, benefits. But suddenly confronted with the loss of her mother and the news that she is about to become a mother herself, Susan's greatest fear is realized. She is losing control.When she learns that her mother's will inexplicably favors her indolent brother, Edward, Susan's already dismantled world is sent flying into a tailspin. As her due date draws near and her family problems become increasingly difficult to ignore, Susan finds help and self-discovery in the most unlikely of places.Featuring an endearing cast of characters and tremendous heart, The Cactus is a poignant debut and a delightful reminder that some things can't be explained by logic alone.</description>

  <description>Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn't spoken for many years, comes to see her. Her unexpected visit forces Lucy to confront the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of her life: her impoverished childhood in Amgash, Illinois, her escape to New York and her desire to become a writer, her faltering marriage, her love for her two daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable. In &lt;i&gt;My Name Is Lucy Barton, &lt;/i&gt;one of America's finest writers shows how a simple hospital visit illuminates the most tender relationship of all-the one between mother and daughter.</description>

  <description>To new nanny Amanda, the Temple family seem to have it all: the former actress; the famous professor; their three successful grown-up children. But like any family, beneath the smiles and hugs there lurks far darker emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years earlier, little Niamh Temple died while they were on holiday in Portugal. Now, as Amanda joins the family for a reunion at their seaside villa, she begins to suspect one of them might be hiding something terrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And suspicion is a dangerous thing.</description>

  <description>My mother's New Year's resolution for me was simple: make a serious effort at putting myself out there and dating again, and do it for one full year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or until I fell in love. Whichever came first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard could one year of swipes and matches and awkward first dates be? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word: bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In nine words: bad and also hilarious, demoralizing, exhausting, and ridiculously amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the only thing worse than dating in the era of hookup apps and unsolicited dick pics is the absolute whole-life-flail of falling in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Nadia gets the 7.30 train every morning without fail. Well, except if she oversleeps or wakes up at her friend Emma’s after too much wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get the 7.30 train every morning, which is easy because he hasn’t been able to sleep properly since his dad died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, Nadia’s eye catches sight of a post in the daily paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;To the cute girl with the coffee stains on her dress. I’m the guy who’s always standing near the doors… Drink sometime?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins a not-quite-romance of near-misses, true love, and the power of the written word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tiffy Moore and Leon Twomey each have a problem and need a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy’s been dumped by her cheating boyfriend and urgently needs a new flat. But earning minimum wage at a quirky publishing house means that her choices are limited in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon, a palliative care nurse, is more concerned with other people’s welfare than his own. Along with working night shifts looking after the terminally ill, his sole focus is on raising money to fight his brother’s unfair imprisonment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon has a flat that he only uses 9 to 5. Tiffy works 9 to 5 and needs a place to sleep. The solution to their problems? To share a bed of course...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Leon and Tiffy’s unusual arrangement becomes a reality, they start to connect through Post-It notes left for each other around the flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can true love blossom even in the unlikeliest of situations?&lt;br /&gt;Can true love blossom even if you never see one another?&lt;br /&gt;Or does true love blossom when you are least expecting it?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don't believe I've done?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning - slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth. But they are not the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?</description>

  <description>Marginalized by previous antics, Sam Shephard is on the bottom rung of detective training in Dunedin, and her boss makes sure she knows it. She gets involved in her first homicide investigation, when a university student is murdered in the Botanic Gardens, and Sam soon discovers this is not an isolated incident. There is a chilling prospect of a predator loose in Dunedin, and a very strong possibility that the deaths are linked to a visiting circus . . . Determined to find out who’s running the show, and to prove herself, Sam throws herself into an investigation that can have only one ending . . . Rich with atmosphere, humor, and a dark, shocking plot, &lt;i&gt;The Ringmaster&lt;/i&gt; marks the return of passionate, headstrong police officer, Sam Shephard, in the next installment of Vanda Symon’s evocative series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;*** There were 54 victims before this. Who is number 55? ***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thriller with a killer hook, and an ending that will make you gasp!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilbrook in Western Australia is a sleepy, remote town that sits on the edge of miles and miles of unexplored wilderness. It is home to Police Sergeant Chandler Jenkins, who is proud to run the town's small police station, a place used to dealing with domestic disputes and noise complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that changes on a scorching day when an injured man stumbles into Chandler's station. He's covered in dried blood. His name is Gabriel. He tells Chandler what he remembers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was drugged and driven to a cabin in the mountains and tied up in iron chains. The man who took him was called Heath. Heath told Gabriel he was going to be number 55. His 55th victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heath is a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a manhunt is launched, a man who says he is Heath walks into the same station. He tells Chandler he was taken by a man named Gabriel. Gabriel told Heath he was going to be victim 55.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel is the serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two suspects. Two identical stories. &lt;i&gt;Which one is the truth?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Delargy has written one of the most exciting &lt;b&gt;debuts of 2019. &lt;/b&gt;He masterfully paints the picture of a remote Western Australian town and its people, swallowed whole by the hunt for a serial killer. This novel has been sold in 19 countries so far and has just been optioned for film.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A timeless story of love and sacrifice, perfect for fans of Rachel Hore, Tracy Rees and Kate Morton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1943: The world is at war, and the villagers of Tyneham are being asked to make one more sacrifice: to give their homes over to the British army. But on the eve of their departure, a terrible act will cause three of them to disappear forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2018: Melissa had hoped a break on the coast of Dorset would rekindle her stagnant relationship, but despite the idyllic scenery, it’s pushing her and Liam to the brink. When Melissa discovers a strange photograph of a woman who once lived in the forgotten local village of Tyneham, she becomes determined to find out more about her story. But Tyneham hides a terrible secret, and Melissa’s search for the truth will change her life in ways she never imagined possible.</description>

  <description>Adèle appears to have the perfect life: She is a successful journalist in Paris who lives in a beautiful apartment with her surgeon husband and their young son. But underneath the surface, she is bored--and consumed by an insatiable need for sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven less by pleasure than compulsion, Adèle organizes her day around her extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she's been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making. Suspenseful, erotic, and electrically charged, Adèle is a captivating exploration of addiction, sexuality, and one woman's quest to feel alive.</description>

  <description>At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.</description>

  <description>Elliðaey is an isolated island off the coast of Iceland. It is has a beautiful, unforgiving terrain and is an easy place to vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Island is the second thrilling book in Ragnar Jonasson's Hidden Iceland trilogy. This time Hulda is at the peak of her career and is sent to investigate what happened on Elliðaey after a group of friends visited but one failed to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could this have links to the disappearance of a couple ten years previously out on the Westfjords? Is there a killer stalking these barren outposts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with Ragnar's haunting and suspenseful prose The Island follows Hulda's journey to uncover the island's secrets and find the truth hidden in its darkest shadows.</description>

  <description>A deadly past refuses to stay buried in Olivia Kiernan’s masterful new novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death is no stranger to Detective Chief Superintendent Frankie Sheehan, but she isn’t the only one from her small, coastal suburb to be intimately acquainted with it. Years ago, teenager Seán Hennessey shocked the tight-knit community when he was convicted of the brutal murder of his parents and attempted slaying of his sister, though he always maintained his innocence. Now, Seán is finally being released from prison—but when his newfound freedom coincides with the discovery of two bodies, the alleged connection between the cases only serves to pull Frankie further from answers even as it draws her closer to her town’s hidden darkness. With a television documentary revisiting Seán’s sentence pushing the public’s sympathies into conflict on a weekly basis, a rabid media pressuring the police like never before, and a rising body count, Frankie will need all of her resources if she is not only to catch a killer, but put to rest what really happened all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dark, irresistible cocktail of secrets, murder, and family, Olivia Kiernan’s latest is an impossible-to-put-down triumph.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Erin Kelly, the masterful author of &lt;i&gt;He Said/She Said&lt;/i&gt;, delivers another irresistible, unputdownable novel of psychological suspense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't keep &lt;b&gt;the secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't tell &lt;b&gt;the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't escape &lt;b&gt;the past&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne was seventeen when she fled her home in Nusstead – leaving behind her family, her boyfriend, Jesse, and the body they buried. Now, thirty years later, forced to return to in order to help care for her sick mother, she can feel the past closing around her. And Jesse, who never forgave her for leaving in the first place, is finally threatening to expose the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne will do anything to protect the life she's built, the husband and daughter who must never know what happened all those years ago. Even if it means turning to her worst enemy for help... But Marianne may not know the whole story – and she isn't the only one with secrets they'd kill to keep.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Inspired by her hugely popular podcast, &lt;em&gt;How To Fail&lt;/em&gt; is Elizabeth Day’s brilliantly funny, painfully honest and insightful celebration of things going wrong. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a book for anyone who has ever failed. Which means it’s a book for everyone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I have learned one thing from this shockingly beautiful venture called life, it is this: failure has taught me lessons I would never otherwise have understood. I have evolved more as a result of things going wrong than when everything seemed to be going right. Out of crisis has come clarity, and sometimes even catharsis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part memoir, part manifesto, and including chapters on dating, work, sport, babies, families, anger and friendship, it is based on the simple premise that understanding why we fail ultimately makes us stronger. It's a book about learning from our mistakes and about not being afraid.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Uplifting, inspiring and rich in stories from Elizabeth’s own life, &lt;em&gt;How to Fail&lt;/em&gt; reveals that failure is not what defines us; rather it is how we respond to it that shapes us as individuals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because learning how to fail is actually learning how to succeed better. And everyone needs a bit of that.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Lelle's daughter went missing in a remote part of Northern Sweden. Lelle has spent the intervening summers driving the Silver Road under the midnight sun, frantically searching for his lost daughter, for himself and for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, seventeen-year-old Meja arrives in town hoping for a fresh start. She is the same age as Lelle's daughter was - a girl on the brink of adulthood. But for Meja, there are dangers to be found in this isolated place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As autumn's darkness slowly creeps in, Lelle and Meja's lives are intertwined in ways, both haunting and tragic, that they could never have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compelling and haunting read is perfect for fans of Daniel Woodrell’s Winter’s Bone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. In this deft exploration of love, loyalty, race, justice, and both Black masculinity and Black womanhood in 21st century America, Jones achieves that most-elusive of all literary goals: the Great American Novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Audrey's family has fallen apart. Her two grown-up daughters, Jess and Lily, are estranged, and her two teenage granddaughters have never been allowed to meet. A secret that echoes back thirty years has splintered the family in two, but is also the one thing keeping them connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions reach breaking point, the irrevocable choice that one of them made all those years ago is about to surface. After years of secrets and silence, how can one broken family find their way back to each other?</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?</description>

  <description>On a warm September morning, an unconscious man is found in a cage at the entrance to the offices of one of Germany's biggest magazines. He's soon identified as a manager of the company, and he's been tortured. Three days later, another manager appears in a similar way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chastity Riley and her new colleague Ivo Stepanovic are tasked with uncovering the truth behind the attacks, an investigation that goes far beyond the revenge they first suspect … to the dubious past shared by both victims. Travelling to the south of Germany, they step into the hothouse world of boarding schools, where secrets are currency, and monsters are bred … monsters who will stop at nothing to protect themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two brothers meet at the border of their vast cattle properties under the unrelenting sun of outback Queensland, in this stunning new standalone novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Jane Harper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are at the stockman’s grave, a landmark so old, no one can remember who is buried there. But today, the scant shadow it casts was the last hope for their middle brother, Cameron. The Bright family’s quiet existence is thrown into grief and anguish. Something had been troubling Cameron. Did he lose hope and walk to his death? Because if he didn’t, the isolation of the outback leaves few suspects…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, suspenseful, and deeply atmospheric, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Man&lt;/i&gt; is the highly anticipated next book from the bestselling and award-winning Jane Harper, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE NATIONAL BESTSELLER &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the sweep of the twentieth century, &lt;i&gt;We Must Be Brave&lt;/i&gt; explores the fierce love that we feel for our children and the power of that love to endure. Beyond distance, beyond time, beyond life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This stirring debut will work its way indelibly into your heart." --Georgia Hunter, author of &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A woman. A war. The child who changed everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 1940. In the disorderly evacuation of Southampton, England, newly married Ellen Parr finds a small child asleep on the backseat of an empty bus. No one knows who little Pamela is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen professed not to want children with her older husband, and when she takes Pamela into her home and rapidly into her heart, she discovers that this is true: Ellen doesn't want children. She wants only Pamela. Three golden years pass as the Second World War rages on. Then one day Pamela is taken away, screaming. Ellen is no stranger to sorrow, but when she returns to the quiet village life she's long lived, she finds herself asking: In a world changed by war, is it fair to wish for an unchanged heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;, here is a novel about courage and kindness, hardship and friendship, and the astonishing power of love.</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....</description>

  <description>Death stalked the Vale.&lt;br /&gt;In every corner, every whisper.&lt;br /&gt;They just didn't know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six neighbours, six secrets, six reasons to want Olive Collins dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the exclusive gated community of Withered Vale, people's lives appear as perfect as their beautifully manicured lawns. Money, success, privilege - the residents have it all. Life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive Collins' dead body has been rotting inside number four for the last three months. Her neighbours say they're shocked at the discovery but nobody thought to check on her when she vanished from sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police start to ask questions and the seemingly flawless facade begins to crack. Because, when it comes to Olive's neighbours, it seems each of them has something to hide, something to lose and everything to gain from her death.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When two teenagers – Johannes and Mari – are found murdered inside their school, in the small Norwegian village of Fredheim, the finger is soon is pointed at eighteen-year-old Even, whose relationship with Mari ended just before she died.&lt;br /&gt;Mari was writing a story for the school newspaper about Even and his dad, who died in a car accident ten years earlier. But was it really an accident? And had Mari uncovered information that someone was willing to commit murder to protect?&lt;br /&gt;Charged and facing trial, Even pores over his memories of the months leading up to the murders, and it becomes clear that more than one villager was acting suspiciously. And as Even recounts his side of the story, it seems that there may be no one he can trust.&lt;br /&gt;But can we trust him?&lt;br /&gt;A taut, moving and chilling thriller, &lt;i&gt;Inborn&lt;/i&gt; examines the very nature of evil, and asks the questions: How well do we really know our families? How well do we know ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of high-concept thrillers such as &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl with All the Gifts&lt;/i&gt;, this breathtaking dystopian psychological thriller follows an American academic stranded at a Swiss hotel as the world descends into nuclear war—along with twenty other survivors—who becomes obsessed with identifying a murderer in their midst after the body of a young girl is discovered in one of the hotel’s water tanks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon thought he had all the time in the world to respond to his wife’s text message: I miss you so much. I feel bad about how we left it. Love you. But as he’s waiting in the lobby of the L’Hotel Sixieme in Switzerland after an academic conference, still mulling over how to respond to his wife, he receives a string of horrifying push notifications. Washington, DC has been hit with a nuclear bomb, then New York, then London, and finally Berlin. That’s all he knows before news outlets and social media goes black—and before the clouds on the horizon turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, two months later, there are twenty survivors holed up at the hotel, a place already tainted by its strange history of suicides and murders. Those who can’t bear to stay commit suicide or wander off into the woods. Jon and the others try to maintain some semblance of civilization. But when the water pressure disappears, and Jon and a crew of survivors investigate the hotel’s water tanks, they are shocked to discover the body of a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As supplies dwindle and tensions rise, Jon becomes obsessed with investigating the death of the little girl as a way to cling to his own humanity. Yet the real question remains: can he afford to lose his mind in this hotel, or should he take his chances in the outside world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Nuclear apocalypse meets murder mystery, with an amazing cast of characters. It's &lt;b&gt;Stephen King meets Agatha Christie&lt;/b&gt;, in this fantastic and highly original novel”&lt;/i&gt; - Luca Vesta, author of &lt;i&gt;Dead Gone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The questions Jameson poses—who will be with you at the end of the world, and what kind of person will you be?—are as haunting as the plot itself. This is a chilling and extraordinary book.”&lt;/i&gt; - Emily St. John Mandel, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The new must-read standalone crime thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Widow&lt;/i&gt;, and the Richard &amp;amp; Judy No. 1 bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt; - featuring unforgettable journalist, Kate Waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The police belonged to another world – the world they saw on the television or in the papers. Not theirs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two eighteen-year-old girls go missing on their gap year in Thailand, their families are thrust into the international spotlight: desperate, bereft and frantic with worry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Kate Waters always does everything she can to be first to the story, first with the exclusive, first to discover the truth – and this time is no exception. But she can’t help but think of her own son, who she hasn’t seen in two years since he left home to go traveling. This time it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The international bestselling godfather of Nordic Noir takes on one of the most horrific periods of modern history, in a stunning standalone thriller…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A masterclass in plotting, atmosphere and character that finely balances shocking twists’ &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, Jewish courier Ester is betrayed, narrowly avoiding arrest by the Gestapo. In a great haste, she escapes to Sweden, saving herself. Her family in Oslo, however, is deported to Auschwitz. In Stockholm, Ester meets the resistance hero, Gerhard Falkum, who has left his little daughter and fled both the Germans and allegations that he murdered his wife, Åse, who helped Ester get to Sweden. Their burgeoning relationship ends abruptly when Falkum dies in a fire.&lt;br /&gt;And yet, twenty-five years later, Falkum shows up in Oslo. He wants to reconnect with his daughter. But where has he been, and what is the real reason for his return? Ester stumbles across information that forces her to look closely at her past, and to revisit her war-time training to stay alive…&lt;br /&gt;Written with Dahl's trademark characterization and elegant plotting, &lt;i&gt;The Courier&lt;/i&gt; sees the hugely respected godfather of Nordic Noir at his best, as he takes on one of the most horrific periods of modern history, in a exceptional, shocking thriller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>If you could look at one life in two different ways, what would you see?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louis and Louise are separated by a single moment in time, a strike of chance that decided their future. The day they were born is when their story began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one, Louis David Alder is born a male.&lt;br /&gt;In the other, Louise Dawn Alder is born a female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louis and Louise are the same in many ways - they have the same best friends, the same parents, the same dream of being a writer and leaving their hometown in Maine as soon as they can. But because of their gender, everything looks different. Certain things will happen in their lives to shape them, hurt them, build them back up again. But what will bring them back home?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A shocking vision of our future that is one part &lt;i&gt;Minority Report&lt;/i&gt; and one part &lt;i&gt;Chinatown&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazlo Ratesic is 54, a 19-year veteran of the Speculative Service, from a family of law enforcement and in a strange alternate society that values law and truth above all else. This is how Laz must, by law, introduce himself, lest he fail to disclose his true purpose or nature, and by doing so, be guilty of a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laz is a resident of The Golden State, a nation resembling California, where like-minded Americans retreated after the erosion of truth and the spread of lies made public life, and governance, increasingly impossible. There, surrounded by the high walls of compulsory truth-telling, knowingly contradicting the truth--the Objectively So--is the greatest possible crime. Stopping those crimes, punishing them, is Laz's job. In its service, he is one of the few individuals permitted to harbor untruths--to "speculate" on what might have happened in the commission of a crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Golden State is far less a paradise than its name might suggest. To monitor, verify, and enforce the Objectively So requires a veritable panopticon of surveillance, recording, and record-keeping. And when those in control of the truth twist it for nefarious means, the Speculators may be the only ones with the power to fight back.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Single-mother Florida bounty-hunter Lori Anderson returns in another nail-biting, high-voltage read. When Lori is kidnapped, and her family threatened, she has 48 hours to save them … or lose everything…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘A real cracker’ &lt;b&gt;Mark Billingham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘My kind of book’ &lt;b&gt;Lee Child&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Like Midnight Run, but much darker … really, really good’ &lt;b&gt;Ian Rankin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A price on her head. A secret worth dying for. 48 hours to expose the truth…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Single-mother bounty-hunter Lori Anderson finally has her family back together, but her new-found happiness is shattered when she’s snatched by the Miami Mob – and they want her dead. Rather than a bullet, they offer her a job: find the Mob’s ‘numbers man’ who’s in protective custody after being forced to turn federal witness against them. If Lori succeeds, they’ll wipe the slate clean and the price on her head – and those of her family – will be removed. If she fails, they die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With North due in court in 48 hours, Lori sets off across Florida, racing against the clock to find him and save her family. Only in this race the prize is more deadly – and the secret she shares with JT more dangerous – than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this race only the winner gets out alive…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Lori thinks with viper-like speed, speaks with strength and acts from her gut. Steph Broadribb has constructed a thoroughly believable world full of substantial yet flawed characters. I quite simply love this series, I leap in with total faith and just let myself go. &lt;i&gt;Deep Dirty Truth&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling, assertive and energetic read’ &lt;b&gt;LoveReading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 'Sharp, thrilling and one hell of a ride. This series just gets better and better!’ &lt;b&gt;Chris Whitaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Brilliant and pacey’ &lt;b&gt;Steve Cavanagh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Perfect for fans of Lee Child and Janet Evanovich’ &lt;b&gt;Alex Caan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Broadribb’s writing is fresh and vivid, crackling with life … an impressive thriller, the kind of book that comfortably sits alongside seasoned pros’ &lt;b&gt;Crime Watch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Fresh, fast and zinging with energy’ &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mirror&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Romping entertainment that moves faster than a bullet’ &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sunday Express&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Stylish with an original take on the lone wolf/bounty hunter theme. This is a novel alive with tension and intriguing twists. … There’s a good deal of wit at the expense of the complacent, anachronistic, loud mouthed quick-fisted mobsters. Just a whole hell of a lot of fun’ &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New Books Magazine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘This is every bit as lively an outing for Broadribb’s heroine as its predecessor, and the pace is satisfyingly unrelenting’ &lt;b&gt;Barry Forshaw’s Book of the Month, &lt;i&gt;CrimeTime&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘Fast-faced, page-turning thriller …  It is so refreshing to read a thriller with a female central character. Especially when that female is as all-round compelling as Lori Anderson’ &lt;b&gt;CrimeSquad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Nerve-wracking and so fast-paced you won’t have time to even stop and breathe … a totally cracking book three’ &lt;b&gt;Jen Med’s Book Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘A compelling and thrilling read, with a kickass protagonist readers are going to love’ &lt;b&gt;By-the-Letter Book Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘With a heroine who jumps off the page and a fantastic supporting cast, this series is a sure-fire winner for anyone with a pulse’ &lt;b&gt;SJI Holliday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Fast and furious … a book you genuinely can’t put down’ &lt;b&gt;TripFiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; ‘I am already looking forward to reading the next book in this fantastic series!’ &lt;b&gt;Book after Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘The best one yet’ &lt;b&gt;Ginger Nut&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘A tightly plotted, breathlessly paced, action packed, character driven novel that reads like the best blockbuster action movies’ &lt;b&gt;Beardy Book Blogger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘A thriller with bite, grit and attitude’ &lt;b&gt;The Book Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Addictive, fun, bang on the money from first page to last!’ &lt;b&gt;Liz Loves Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Superb’ &lt;b&gt;Hair Past a Freckle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>In an isolated country town brought to its knees by endless drought, a charismatic and dedicated young priest calmly opens fire on his congregation, killing five parishioners before being shot dead himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, troubled journalist Martin Scarsden arrives in Riversend to write a feature on the anniversary of the tragedy. But the stories he hears from the locals about the priest and incidents leading up to the shooting don't fit with the accepted version of events his own newspaper reported in an award-winning investigation. Martin can't ignore his doubts, nor the urgings of some locals to unearth the real reason behind the priest's deadly rampage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Martin believes he is making headway, a shocking new development rocks the town, which becomes the biggest story in Australia. The media descends on Riversend and Martin is now the one in the spotlight. His reasons for investigating the shooting have suddenly become very personal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrestling with his own demons, Martin finds himself risking everything to discover a truth that becomes darker and more complex with every twist. But there are powerful forces determined to stop him, and he has no idea how far they will go to make sure the town's secrets stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compulsive thriller that will haunt you long after you have turned the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve in 1988, seven-year-old Alfie Marsden vanished in the Wentshire Forest Pass, when a burst tyre forced his father, Sorrel, to stop the car. Leaving the car to summon the emergency services, Sorrel returned to find his son gone. No trace of the child, nor his remains, have ever been found. Alfie Marsden was declared officially dead in 1995.&lt;br /&gt;Elusive online journalist, Scott King, whose ‘Six Stories’ podcasts have become an internet sensation, investigates the disappearance, interviewing six witnesses, including Sorrel, his son and his ex-partner, to try to find out what really happened that fateful night. He takes a journey through the trees of the Wentshire Forest – a place synonymous with strange sightings, and tales of hidden folk who dwell there. He talks to a company that tried and failed to build a development in the forest, and a psychic who claims to know where Alfie is…&lt;br /&gt;Intensely dark, deeply chilling and searingly thought provoking, &lt;i&gt;Changeling&lt;/i&gt; is an up-to-the-minute, startling thriller, taking you to places you will never, ever forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Bold, clever and genuinely chilling with a terrific twist that provides an explosive final punch’ Deidre O’Brien, &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mirror&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A genuine genre-bending debut’ Carla McKay, &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Impeccably crafted and gripping from start to finish’ Doug Johnstone, &lt;i&gt;The Big Issue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘With a unique structure, an ingenious plot and so much suspense you can’t put it down, this is the very epitome of a must-read’ &lt;i&gt;Heat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1940, Evert Dax and David Sparsholt, two young men from very different backgrounds, meet at Oxford University. Dax is a second year student reading English, coming from a rackety upper middle class background; Sparsholt is from a humbler Midlands community and is reading engineering, a young man whose good looks and fine figure have proved highly attractive to his peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time is a unique one in the history of the university: with military call-up at twenty, soon brought forward to nineteen, almost all students come up to Oxford knowing that they will only have a year or so of study. A sense of futility is mixed with one of recklessness. All life after dusk is lived under black-out, encouraging and covering what would normally be impossible liaisons. What happens to these two men in this year will affect many lives and will set in motion the mystery at the heart of &lt;i&gt;The Sparsholt Affair&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan Hollinghurst's masterly novel takes us through several generations and across key periods of uncertainty and change in British society. From the darkest days of the Second World War, it moves to the changing world of the a socially and sexually liberated London of the 1960s, before landing in the mid-1970s, with the three-day week, fuel shortages and power cuts. The reverberations continue through the next generation in the 1990s before reaching a conclusion in the present decade, a world of new media and new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the novel there is also an examination of the visual and aesthetic, looking at what it is to be Modern, through modernist architecture and abstract painting: we witness buildings being destroyed and replaced; we watch works of art go in and out of fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring a remarkable cast of characters, &lt;i&gt;The Sparsholt Affair&lt;/i&gt; is both thought-provoking and highly entertaining, a novel in which children are connected by the acts of their parents and individuals are both damaged and saved by the changing attitudes to sexuality, privacy and intimacy.</description>

  <description>Books are dangerous things in Collins's alternate universe, a place vaguely reminiscent of 19th-century England. It's a world in which people visit book binders to rid themselves of painful or treacherous memories. Once their stories have been told and are bound between the pages of a book, the slate is wiped clean and their memories lose the power to hurt or haunt them. After having suffered some sort of mental collapse and no longer able to keep up with his farm chores, Emmett Farmer is sent to the workshop of one such binder to live and work as her apprentice. Leaving behind home and family, Emmett slowly regains his health while learning the binding trade. He is forbidden to enter the locked room where books are stored, so he spends many months marbling end pages, tooling leather book covers, and gilding edges. But his curiosity is piqued by the people who come and go from the inner sanctum, and the arrival of the lordly Lucian Darnay, with whom he senses a connection, changes everything.</description>

  <description>At 14, Turtle Alveston knows the use of every gun on her wall. She knows how to snare a rabbit, sharpen a blade and splint a bone. She knows that her daddy loves her more than anything else in this world and he’ll do whatever it takes to keep her with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she doesn’t know why she feels so different from the other girls at school; why the line between love and pain can be so hard to see. Or why making a friend may be the bravest and most terrifying thing she has ever done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the people you’re supposed to trust are the ones who do most harm. And what you’ve been taught to fear is the very thing that will save you…</description>

  &lt;b&gt;As the threads of their lives unravel … they find magic under their feet…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Sam falls in love with South London thug Derek, and Anne’s best friend Kathleen takes her own life, they discover they are linked not just by a world of drugs and revenge; they also share the friendship of the uncanny and enigmatic Deborah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Seamstress, sailor, story-teller and self-proclaimed centenarian immortal, Deborah slowly reveals to Anne and Sam her improbable, fantastical life, the mysterious world that lies beneath their feet and, ultimately, the solution to their crises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With echoes of Armistead Maupin and a hint of magic realism, &lt;i&gt;Attend &lt;/i&gt;is a beautifully written, darkly funny, mesmerisingly emotive and deliciously told debut novel, rich in finely wrought characters that you will never forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to rise again…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hilarious new heartbreaker from Mhairi McFarlane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing worse than being fired from the grottiest restaurant in town, it’s coming home early to find your boyfriend in bed with someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from the indignity of a double dumping on the same day, Georgina snatches at the next job that she’s offered – barmaid in a newly opened pub, which just so happens to run by the boy she fell in love with at school: Lucas McCarthy. And whereas Georgina (voted Most Likely to Succeed in her school yearbook) has done nothing but dead-end jobs in the last twelve years, Lucas has not only grown into a broodingly handsome man, but also has turned into an actual grown-up with a business and a dog along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Lucas again not only throws Georgina’s rackety present into sharp relief, but also brings a dark secret from her past bubbling to the surface. Only she knows the truth about what happened on the last day of school, and why she’s allowed it to chase her all these years…</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When single mum Joanna hears a rumour at the school gates, she never intends to pass it on. But one casual comment leads to another and now there’s no going back . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumour has it that a notorious child killer is living under a new identity, in their sleepy little town of Flinstead-on-Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally McGowan was just ten years old when she stabbed little Robbie Harris to death forty-eight years ago – no photos of her exist since her release as a young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who is the supposedly reformed killer who now lives among them? How dangerous can one rumour become? And how far will Joanna go to protect her loved ones from harm, when she realizes what it is she’s unleashed?</description>

  <description>Old spooks carry the memory of tradecraft in their bones, and when Solomon Dortmund sees an envelope being passed from one pair of hands to another in a Marylebone café, he knows he's witnessed more than an innocent encounter. But in relaying his suspicions to John Bachelor, who babysits retired spies like Solly, he sets in train events which will alter lives. Bachelor himself, a hair's breadth away from sleeping in his car, is clawing his way back to stability; Hannah Weiss, the double agent whose recruitment was his only success, is starting to enjoy the secrets and lies her role demands; and Lech Wicinski, an Intelligence Service analyst, finds that a simple favour for an old acquaintance might derail his career. Meanwhile, Lady Di Taverner is trying to keep the Service on an even keel, and if that means throwing the odd crew member overboard, well: collateral damage is her speciality.&lt;br /&gt;A drop, in spook parlance, is the passing on of secret information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also what happens just before you hit the ground.</description>

  <description>On a dark midwinter’s night in an ancient inn on the river Thames, an extraordinary event takes place. The regulars are telling stories to while away the dark hours, when the door bursts open on a grievously wounded stranger. In his arms is the lifeless body of a small child. Hours later, the girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life. Is it a miracle? Is it magic? Or can science provide an explanation? These questions have many answers, some of them quite dark indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who dwell on the river bank apply all their ingenuity to solving the puzzle of the girl who died and lived again, yet as the days pass the mystery only deepens. The child herself is mute and unable to answer the essential questions: Who is she? Where did she come from? And to whom does she belong? But answers proliferate nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three families are keen to claim her. A wealthy young mother knows the girl is her kidnapped daughter, missing for two years. A farming family reeling from the discovery of their son’s secret liaison, stand ready to welcome their granddaughter. The parson’s housekeeper, humble and isolated, sees in the child the image of her younger sister. But the return of a lost child is not without complications and no matter how heartbreaking the past losses, no matter how precious the child herself, this girl cannot be everyone’s. Each family has mysteries of its own, and many secrets must be revealed before the girl’s identity can be known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Upon a River is a glorious tapestry of a book that combines folklore and science, magic and myth. Suspenseful, romantic, and richly atmospheric, the beginning of this novel will sweep you away on a powerful current of storytelling, transporting you through worlds both real and imagined, to the triumphant conclusion whose depths will continue to give up their treasures long after the last page is turned.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone's invited...everyone's a suspect...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of Ruth Ware and Tana French, a shivery, atmospheric, page-turning novel of psychological suspense in the tradition of Agatha Christie, in which a group of old college friends are snowed in at a hunting lodge . . . and murder and mayhem ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All of them are friends. One of them is a killer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrive on December 30th, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one of them is dead . . . and another of them did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your friends close, the old adage goes. But just how close is too close?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One crossed wire, three dead bodies and six bottles of bleach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth Beauman can’t sleep. He stays up late, calling strangers from his phonebook, hoping to make a connection, while his wife, Maeve, sleeps upstairs. A crossed wire finds a suicidal Hadley Serf on the phone to Seth, thinking she is talking to The Samaritans.&lt;br /&gt;But a seemingly harmless, late-night hobby turns into something more for Seth and for Hadley, and soon their late-night talks are turning into day-time meet-ups. And then this dysfunctional love story turns into something altogether darker, when Seth brings Hadley home…&lt;br /&gt;And someone is watching…&lt;br /&gt;Dark, sexy, dangerous and wildly readable, &lt;i&gt;Good Samaritans&lt;/i&gt; marks the scorching return of one of crime fiction’s most exceptional voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Discover a brilliant story of love, danger, courage and betrayal, from the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Betrayal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directly I saw him, I knew he had to die.’&lt;/i&gt; Germany, 1945. Klara Janowska and her daughter Alicja have walked for weeks to get to Graufeld Displaced Persons camp. In the cramped, dirty, dangerous conditions they, along with 3,200 others, are the lucky ones. They have survived and will do anything to find a way back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Klara recognises a man in the camp from her past, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. He knows exactly what she did during the war to save her daughter. She knows his real identity. What will be the price of silence? And will either make it out of the camp alive?</description>

  <description>She's the girl next door. He's the guy who's loved her from afar.&lt;br /&gt;They're in for an unexpected tumble into love.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She'll juggle your balls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Stella Allesandro, chaos is good. She's a rising star at a leading sports publicity firm. She's known throughout the industry as the jock whisperer—the one who can tame the baddest of the bad boys in professional sports without losing her signature smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Cal Hartshorn is an entirely different kind of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He'll fix your broken heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ex-Army Ranger and now-famous cardiothoracic surgeon fails at nothing…except talking to a woman he's adored from afar. Whether on the battlefield or operating room, he's exacting, precise, and efficient, but all of that crumbles when Stella is in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cal always knows—and gets—what he wants, and now he wants all of her. His forever girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Stella isn't convinced she's anyone's forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliff-side mansion on the Italian Riviera. Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in André Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion. &lt;em&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/em&gt; is clear-eyed, bare-knuckled, and ultimately unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of Gillian Flynn and Donna Tartt, a dark, propulsive and addictive debut thriller, splashed with all the glitz and glitter of New York City.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They go through both bottles of champagne right there on the High Line, with nothing but the stars over them... They drink and Lavinia tells Louise about all the places they will go together, when they finish their stories, when they are both great writers-to Paris and to Rome and to Trieste...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavinia will never go. She is going to die soon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise has nothing. Lavinia has everything. After a chance encounter, the two spiral into an intimate, intense, and possibly toxic friendship. A &lt;i&gt;Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/i&gt; for the digital age, this seductive story takes a classic tale of obsession and makes it irresistibly new.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My real name, no one remembers. The truth about that summer, no one else knows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 1862, a group of young artists led by the passionate and talented Edward Radcliffe descends upon Birchwood Manor on the banks of the Upper Thames. Their plan: to spend a secluded summer month in a haze of inspiration and creativity. But by the time their stay is over, one woman has been shot dead while another has disappeared; a priceless heirloom is missing; and Edward Radcliffe’s life is in ruins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over one hundred and fifty years later, Elodie Winslow, a young archivist in London, uncovers a leather satchel containing two seemingly unrelated items: a sepia photograph of an arresting-looking woman in Victorian clothing, and an artist’s sketchbook containing the drawing of a twin-gabled house on the bend of a river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does Birchwood Manor feel so familiar to Elodie? And who is the beautiful woman in the photograph? Will she ever give up her secrets?</description>

  <description>Kylmä trilleri. Kuuma komedia. Ilman suojakertoimia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heinäkuun alku suomalaisessa pikkukaupungissa: rantalomakohteen uusi omistaja on nimennyt paikan Palm Beach Finlandiksi houkutellakseen turisteja paitsi koti- myös ulkomailta. Kaupunkiin juuri palanneen Olivia Kosken perintöhuvilan keittiöstä löytyy kuollut mies. Paikalle lähetetään Keskusrikospoliisin peitetoimintayksikön paras tutkija. Hänen roolinsa: surffauksesta innostunut matematiikanopettaja. Tehtävä: selvitä mitä tapahtui – keinolla millä hyvänsä.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palm Beach Finland on trilleri, rakkaustarina ja melko pimeä komedia. Se jatkaa ylistetyn Mies joka kuoli -romaanin viitoittamaa, makaaberin huumorin sävyttämää tyylilajia – jälleen uudesta tuomaismaisesta näkökulmasta.</description>

  <description>A heart-warming story full of winter warmth and new beginnings. Perfect for the fans of Cecelia Ahern.&lt;br /&gt;Carrie Nolan is devastated when she is dumped by Kevin Mulvey after more than a decade without even a backwards glance! On reflection, she has sacrificed her own long term happiness establishing their critically acclaimed Dublin restaurant and pandering to his excessive ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Kevin can't believe his luck. Valentina, their new waitress is a stunner, the kind of girl that turns heads when she walks in a room and surprise, surprise she has chosen him! He is living the dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie seeks solace from a circle of mismatched friends who need her as much as she needs them. Jane, who struggles to run the pub on the opposite side of the street, Luke, who has stopped drifting while his father settles in a nearby nursing home and Teddy, a dog who asks for nothing more than the chance to stay by Carrie's side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Christmas just around the corner, all is not quite as it seems and a catastrophic sequence of events leads to the unthinkable... &lt;br /&gt;How far do you need to fall before you learn the true value of family and friends? And is it ever too late to start again...</description>

  <description>Happily settled in Florida, Sonja believes she’s finally escaped the trap set by unscrupulous drug lords. But when her son Tomas is taken, she’s back to square one . . . and Iceland. Her lover, Agla, is awaiting sentencing for financial misconduct after the banking crash, and Sonja refuses to see her. And that’s not all. Agla owes money to some extremely powerful men, and they’ll stop at nothing to get it back. With her former nemesis, customs officer Bragi, on her side, Sonja puts her own plan into motion, to bring down the drug barons and her scheming ex-husband, and get Tomas back safely. But things aren’t as straightforward as they seem, and Sonja finds herself caught in the center of a trap that will put all of their lives at risk. Set in a Reykjavík still covered in the dust of the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption,&lt;i&gt; Trap&lt;/i&gt; boasts a dark, fast-paced and chilling plot and intriguing characters.</description>

  <description>It's 1969, and while the summer of love lingers in London, Gilda is consumed by the mistakes of her past. She walked out on her beloved son Reuben when he was just a boy and fears he'll never forgive her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Reuben marries a petite blonde gentile, Gilda takes it as the ultimate rejection. Her cold, distant son seems transformed by love - a love she's craved his entire adult life. What does his new wife have that she doesn't? And how far will she go to find out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's an obsession that will bring shocking truths about the past to light . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitter is a beautiful and devastating novel about the decisions that define our lives, the fragility of love and the bond between mother and son.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer—or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining all of the hallmarks that have made Liane Moriarty's writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, &lt;i&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/i&gt; once again shows why she is a master of her craft.</description>

  <description>Toby is a happy-go-lucky charmer who's dodged a scrape at work and is celebrating with friends when the night takes a turn that will change his life: he surprises two burglars who beat him and leave him for dead. Struggling to recover from his injuries, beginning to understand that he might never be the same man again, he takes refuge at his family's ancestral home to care for his dying uncle Hugo. Then a skull is found in the trunk of an elm tree in the garden - and as detectives close in, Toby is forced to face the possibility that his past may not be what he has always believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Witch Elm&lt;/i&gt; asks what we become, and what we're capable of, when we no longer know who we are.</description>

  <description>The Whitbread Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;A Good Man in Africa&lt;/i&gt; and the Costa Award-winning &lt;i&gt;Restless&lt;/i&gt; now gives us a sweeping new novel that unfolds across fin-de-siècle Europe as it tells a story of ineffable passions--familial, artistic, romantic--and their power to shape, and destroy, a life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brodie Moncur is a brilliant piano tuner, as brilliant in his own way as John Kilbarron--"The Irish Liszt"--the pianist Brodie accompanies on all of his tours from Paris to Saint Petersburg, as essential to Kilbarron as the pianist's own hands. It is a luxurious life, and a level of success Brodie could hardly have dreamed of growing up in a remote Scottish village, in a household ruled by a tyrannical father. But Brodie would gladly give it all up for the love of the Russian soprano Lika Blum: beautiful, worldly, seductive--and consort to Kilbarron. And though seemingly doomed from the start, Brodie's passion for her only grows as their lives become increasingly more intertwined, more secretive, and, finally, more dangerous--what Brodie doesn't know about Lika, and about her connection to Kilbarron and his sinister brother, Malachi, eventually testing not only his love for her but his ability, and will, to survive.</description>

  <description>Claire DeWitt, the world’s best private detective, wakes up one dark night in an ambulance in Oakland: someone has just tried to murder her. But she’s not dead. Not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More sure of herself than of the police, Claire follows the clues on a 52-hour odyssey through shimmering Las Vegas and the shabby surrounding desert to find out who wants her dead. But in order to save herself, Claire will have to revisit her own complicated past as she navigates the present: a past of childhood obsessions, rival detectives, lost friends, and mysteries mostly—but not always—solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three intertwining stories illuminate three eras of Claire’s life: her early years as an ambitious girl detective in Brooklyn (before it was gentrified), which ended when her best friend and partner in crime-solving disappeared; a case of an unexplained death in the art world of late-1990s Los Angeles, when, devastated by the demise of her mentor in New Orleans, Claire was forced to start again; and her current quest to save her own life from a determined assassin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the connections between the stories come into focus, the truth becomes clear. But Claire, battered and bruised, will never quit her search for the answer to the biggest mystery of all: how can anyone survive in a world so clearly designed to break our hearts?</description>

Could there be a connection with the frightened woman? While Poirot struggles to put together the bizarre pieces of the puzzle, the murderer prepares another hotel bedroom for a fourth victim...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;You need to know who your husband really was…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Paula Gadd’s husband of almost thirty years dies, just days away from the seventh anniversary of their son, Christopher’s death, her world falls apart. Grieving and bereft, she is stunned when a young woman approaches her at the funeral service, and slips something into her pocket. A note suggesting that Paula’s husband was not all that he seemed…&lt;br /&gt;When the two women eventually meet, a series of revelations challenges everything Paula thought they knew, and it becomes immediately clear that both women’s lives are in very real danger.&lt;br /&gt; Both a dark, twisty slice of domestic noir and taut, explosive psychological thriller, &lt;i&gt;After He Died&lt;/i&gt; is also a chilling reminder that the people we trust the most can harbour the deadliest secrets…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunday Times &lt;/i&gt;Number One&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/i&gt;, soon to be a major Sky TV series, a novel about what it takes to become a vampire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in contemporary Paris and London, and the American colonies during the upheaval and unrest that exploded into the Revolutionary War, a sweeping story that braids together the past and present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life, free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus's deeply-held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to contemporary London, where Marcus has fallen for Phoebe Taylor, a young employee at Sotheby's. She decides to become a vampire, too, and though the process at first seems uncomplicated, the couple discovers that the challenges facing a human who wishes to be a vampire are no less formidable in the modern world than they were in the 18th century. The shadows that Marcus believed he'd escaped centuries ago may return to haunt them both - for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities for change, &lt;i&gt;Time's Convert&lt;/i&gt; will delight fans of the All Souls trilogy and all readers of magic, the supernatural, and romance.</description>

  <description>Sam Shephard, a young sole-charge police constable in Mataura, is the main character in a new series of crime novels set in New Zealand. When a young mother in the town is brutally murdered (it seems to be a professional job), Sam is at the heart of the police hunt to find the killer. But then Sam's past relationship with the dead woman's husband is revealed. Sam is stood down from the case and is now a prime murder suspect. Frustrated, Sam loses her cool. She can't stop herself making murder inquiries and gets into serious trouble with her police superiors. But then the young constable stumbles onto something. The murdered woman was working as a journalist and had uncovered a local scandal. She'd been killed to keep her quiet. When Sam enters this world she's in real physical danger, until at last a conspiracy is uncovered and the killer revealed. Disillusioned, Sam prepares to leave town. What will she do next?</description>

  <description>The morning after real estate agent Gemma Brogan has dinner with a prospective client, she's furious at herself for drinking so much. But there will be more to regret than a nasty hangover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She starts receiving mementos from that night: A photo of a hallway kiss. A video of her complaining about her husband. And worse...much worse. The problem is she doesn't remember any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the blackmailing and menace ramp up, Gemma fears for her already shaky marriage. The paranoia, the feeling that her life is spiraling out of control, will take her back to another night--years ago--that changed everything. And Gemma will realize just how far the shadows from her past can reach...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gripping, tense, twisty and full of emotional insight, COME AND FIND ME is Sarah Hilary's Marnie Rome 5 book, for fans of Mick Herron or Clare Mackintosh. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Hilary belts out a corker of a story, all wrapped up in her vivid, effortless prose. If you're not reading this series of London-set police procedurals then you need to start right away' &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, Lara Chorley and Ruth Hull have nothing in common, other than their infatuation with Michael Vokey. Each is writing to a sadistic inmate, sharing her secrets, whispering her worst fears, craving his attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Marnie Rome understands obsession. She's finding it hard to give up her own addiction to a dangerous man: her foster brother, Stephen Keele. She wasn't able to save her parents from Stephen. She lives with that guilt every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the hunt for Vokey gathers pace, Marnie fears one of the women may have found him - and is about to pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>Do you really want to know the truth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Bonham moved halfway around the world to be with the man she loves. Although expat life in Singapore can be difficult, Edward Bonham is a dream husband and a doting father to his teenage daughter, Josie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their maid dies in an apparent suicide—and Amanda discovers the woman was pregnant and hiding a stash of drugs prescribed to Edward—she can’t help but wonder if her perfect husband has a fatal flaw. And if he can’t resist temptation under their own roof, what does he get up to when he travels?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camille Kemble also has questions for Edward. Recently returned to Singapore, Camille is determined to resolve a family mystery. Amid a jumble of faded childhood memories, she keeps seeing Edward’s handsome face. And she wants to know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one woman, the search for answers threatens everything she has. For another, it’s the key to all she lost. Both will follow his trail of secrets into the darkness to find the truth.</description>

  <description>From the attic of Lyntons, a dilapidated English country mansion, Frances Jellico sees them—Cara first: dark and beautiful, then Peter: striking and serious. The couple is spending the summer of 1969 in the rooms below hers while Frances is researching the architecture in the surrounding gardens. But she's distracted. Beneath a floorboard in her bathroom, she finds a peephole that gives her access to her neighbors’ private lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Frances' surprise, Cara and Peter are keen to get to know her. It is the first occasion she has had anybody to call a friend, and before long they are spending every day together: eating lavish dinners, drinking bottle after bottle of wine, and smoking cigarettes until the ash piles up on the crumbling furniture. Frances is dazzled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the hot summer rolls lazily on, it becomes clear that not everything is right between Cara and Peter. The stories that Cara tells don’t quite add up, and as Frances becomes increasingly entangled in the lives of the glamorous, hedonistic couple, the boundaries between truth and lies, right and wrong, begin to blur. Amid the decadence, a small crime brings on a bigger one: a crime so terrible that it will brand their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Jan Nyman, the ace detective of the covert operations unit of the National Central Police, is sent to a sleepy seaside town to investigate a mysterious death. Nyman arrives in the town dominated by a bizarre holiday village—the "hottest beach in Finland." The suspect: Olivia Koski, who has only recently returned to her old hometown. The mission: find out what happened, by any means necessary. With a nod to &lt;i&gt;Fargo&lt;/i&gt;, and dark noir, &lt;i&gt;Palm Beach, Finland &lt;/i&gt;is both a page-turning thriller and a black comedy about lust for money, fleeing dreams, and people struggling at turning points in their lives—chasing their fantasies regardless of reason.</description>

  <description>1948: the French Riviera: an English housewife trapped in a dull marriage escapes to the South of France to claim a mystery inheritance. But rivals to her unexplained fortune begin to emerge, and now they want her out of the way ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But don’t you think it strange?&lt;/i&gt; she presses him. &lt;i&gt;That this man I have never heard of should have left me such a gift?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1948: Eve Forrester is trapped in a loveless marriage, in a gloomy house, in a grey London suburb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, out of the blue, she receives a solicitor's letter. A wealthy stranger has left her a mystery inheritance. And to find out more, she must travel to the glittering French Riviera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There Eve discovers that her legacy is an enchanting pale pink villa overlooking the Mediterranean sea. Suddenly her life could not be more glamorous. But while she rubs shoulders with film-stars and famous writers, under the heat of the golden sun, rivals to her unexplained fortune begin to emerge. Rivals who want her out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone in this beguiling paradise, Eve must unlock the story behind her surprise bequest – before events turn deadly . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminiscent of a Golden Age mystery, &lt;i&gt;Fatal Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; is an intoxicating story of dysfunctional families and long-hidden secrets, set against the razzle-dazzle and decadence of the French Riviera.</description>

  <description>An isolated Swedish town. A deaf reporter terrified of nature. A dense spruce forest overdue for harvest. A pair of eyeless hunters found murdered in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s week one of the Swedish elk hunt and the sound of gunfire is everywhere. When Tuva Moodyson investigates the story that could make her career she stumbles on a web of secrets that knit Gavrik town together. Are the latest murders connected to the Medusa killings twenty years ago? Is someone following her? Why take the eyes? Tuva must face her demons and venture deep into the woods to stop the killer and write the story. And then get the hell out of Gavrik.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What are you doing to help yourself? What are you doing to show that you're worth the resources?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a near-future world, medical technology has progressed far enough that immortality is now within grasp -but only to those who show themselves to be deserving of it. These people are the lifers: the exercisers, yogacisers, green juicers and early nighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genetically perfect, healthy and wholesome, one hundred-year-old Lea is the poster girl for lifers, until the day she catches a glimpse of her father in the street, eighty-eight years after their last encounter. While pursuing him, Lea has a brush with death which sparks suspicions. If Lea could be so careless, is she worthy of immortality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suicide Club wasn't always an activist group. It began as a set of disillusioned lifers, gathering to indulge in forbidden activities: performances of live music, artery-clogging meals, irresponsible orgies. But now they have been branded terrorists and are hunted by the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Lea has decided to give them a call.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.</description>

  <description>Dear Jackson,&lt;br /&gt;I'm leaving you this note because I know you're very busy and I don't want to waste the town sheriff's time. Lord knows I've already wasted enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking me home last night and...everything else. I made you a basket of wild blueberry muffins for your trouble. That seemed like the appropriate baked good for getting naked in your living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't myself last night. I didn't mean to kiss you or fondle your backside or ask all those intimate questions. Thank you for pretending to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very noble of you to sleep on the couch while I was starfished on your bed. I couldn't help but notice it's quite large. The bed, that is. I swear, I didn't notice anything else when I let myself out this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know, Talbott's Cove is a ridiculously small town and there's no chance we can avoid each other. Not that I'd want to avoid you, of course, but I'm not sure I can look at you without thinking of the forty different ways I made a fool of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of avoidance, let's try to be friends. We'll forget all about last night…if that's what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please burn this note after you read it—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I whipped up some cinnamon buns, too. Please enjoy them. I'm not sure why, but I couldn't get buns out of my mind today.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/em&gt; comes a story of taking chances and learning to love again as two people, one mourning her husband and the other recovering from divorce, cross paths on the centuries-old Camino pilgrimage from France to Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Chemin will change you. It changes everyone…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chemin, also known as the Camino de Santiago, is a centuries-old pilgrim route that ends in Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain. Every year, thousands of walkers—some devout, many not—follow the route that wends through quaint small villages and along busy highways alike, a journey unlike any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe, an artist from California who’s still reeling from her husband’s sudden death, has impulsively decided to walk the Camino, hoping to find solace and direction. Martin, an engineer from England, is road-testing a cart of his own design…and recovering from a messy divorce. They begin in the same French town, each uncertain of what the future holds. Zoe has anticipated the physical difficulties of her trek, but she is less prepared for other challenges, as strangers and circumstances force her to confront not just recent loss, but long-held beliefs. For Martin, the pilgrimage is a test of his skills and endurance but also, as he and Zoe grow closer, of his willingness to trust others—and himself—again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart and funny, insightful and romantic, &lt;em&gt;Two Steps Forward&lt;/em&gt; reveals that the most important journeys we make aren’t measured in miles, but in the strength, wisdom, and love found along the way. Fans of &lt;em&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/em&gt; will recognize Graeme Simsion’s uniquely quirky and charming writing style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Virginia Wrathmell has always known she will meet her death on the marsh in reparation for the mistakes of her childhood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On New Year's Eve, at the age of eighty-six, Virginia feels the time has finally come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1939, Virginia is ten, an orphan arriving to meet her new adoptive parents, Clem and Lorna Wrathmell, at their mysterious house, Salt Winds. The house sits right on the edge of a vast marsh, a beautiful but dangerous place. It's the start of a new life for Virginia, but she quickly senses that all is not right between Clem and Lorna - in particular, the presence of their wealthy neighbour Max Deering, who takes an unhealthy interest in the family. When a German fighter plane crashes into the marsh, Clem ventures onto the deadly sands to rescue the airman. And that is when things really begin to go wrong...</description>

I can wax lyrical about this novel and if you’re (un)lucky enough to be a friend of mine I am probably going to be banging on about Call of the Curlew by Elizabeth Bro...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in the French countryside on an idyllic summer vacation, a delicious, tender novel about finding joy and love even in the most unexpected places. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess and her ten-year-old son William set off to spend the summer at Château de Roussignol, deep in the rich, sunlit hills of the Dordogne. There, Jess’s ex-boyfriend—and William’s father—Adam, runs a beautiful hotel in a restored castle. Lush gardens, a gorgeous pool, delectable French food, and a seemingly never-ending wine list—what’s not to like? Jess is bowled over by what Adam has accomplished, but she’s in France for a much more urgent reason: to make Adam fall in love with his own son. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Adam has other ideas, and another girlfriend—and he doesn’t seem inclined to change the habits of a lifetime just because Jess and William have appeared on the scene. Jess isn’t surprised, but William—who has quickly come to idolize his father—wants nothing more than to spend time with him. But Jess can’t allow Adam to let their son down—because she is tormented by a secret of her own, one that nobody—especially William—must discover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns heartwrenching and hopeful, You Me Everything is a novel about one woman's fierce determination to grab hold of the family she has and never let go, and a romantic story as heady as a crisp Sancerre on a summer day.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One is playing a long game. But which one?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They meet at a local tavern in the small town of Belleville, Delaware. Polly is set on heading west. Adam says he’s also passing through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet she stays and he stays—drawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the other—dangerous, even lethal, secrets that begin to accumulate as autumn approaches, feeding the growing doubts they conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone dies. Was it an accident, or part of a plan? By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each other’s lives and lies that neither one knows how to get away—or even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something—or someone—has to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Which one will it be?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Just a quick mouth swab and soon you’ll be matched with your perfect partner—the one you’re genetically made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the promise made by Match Your DNA. A decade ago, the company announced that they had found the gene that pairs each of us with our soul mate. Since then, millions of people around the world have been matched. But the discovery has its downsides: test results have led to the breakup of countless relationships and upended the traditional ideas of dating, romance and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now five very different people have received the notification that they’ve been “Matched.” They’re each about to meet their one true love. But “happily ever after” isn’t guaranteed for everyone. Because even soul mates have secrets. And some are more shocking than others…</description>

  <description>America is in the grip of a deadly flu pandemic. When Frank catches the virus, his girlfriend Polly will do whatever it takes to save him, even if it means risking everything. She agrees to a radical plan—time travel has been invented in the future to thwart the virus. If she signs up for a one-way-trip into the future to work as a bonded labourer, the company will pay for the life-saving treatment Frank needs. Polly promises to meet Frank again in Galveston, Texas, where she will arrive in twelve years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Polly is re-routed an extra five years into the future, Frank is nowhere to be found. Alone in a changed and divided America, with no status and no money, Polly must navigate a new life and find a way to locate Frank, to discover if he is alive, and if their love has endured.</description>

  <description>This is almost a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis and Michael are twelve when they first become friends, and for a long time it is just the two of them, cycling the streets of Oxford, teaching themselves how to swim, discovering poetry, and dodging the fists of an overbearing father. And then one day this closest of friendships grows into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then we fast forward a decade or so, to find that Ellis is married to Annie, and Michael is nowhere in sight. Which leads to the question, what happened in the years between?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is almost a love story. But it's not as simple as that.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In her unmissable debut, actress and screenwriter Ruth Jones shows us the dangers of trying to recapture that which was once lost and failing to realise the beauty of what we already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;We spend most of our lives wishing we were somewhere else or someone else, or looking forward or harping back. Always thinking the grass is greener on the other side. But it never is. It’s still grass. Just a different patch of it, that’s all.&lt;/i&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The past has a habit of tracking us down. And tripping us up.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kate was twenty-two, she had an intense and passionate affair with a married man, Callum, which ended in heartbreak. Kate thought she’d never get over it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen years later, life has moved on – Kate, now a successful actress, is living in London, married to Matt and mother to little Tallulah. Meanwhile Callum and his wife Belinda are happy together, living in Edinburgh and watching their kids grow up. The past, it would seem, is well and truly behind them all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Kate meets Callum again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they are faced with a choice: to walk away from each other . . . or to risk finding out what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Second chances are a rare gift in life. But that doesn’t mean they should always be taken . . .&lt;/b&gt;

      <![CDATA[Gosh this is going to be a difficult book to review. I’m going to start by saying that I did enjoy Never Greener, the debut novel by actress Ruth Jones but I didn’t love it and I am unsure whether it was the fact I was reading it as an audiobook (is that right?

  <description>Two murders. One missing girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Kate Fletcher is called out to a freezing canal where a woman’s body is found floating in a lock. With no identification, the police struggle to piece together the details of the woman’s life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Thorpe a daughter confesses to the murder of her father. She says she helped him escape a painful death from liver cancer, but was her role more active than she claims? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kate and her team investigate, the links between the two cases are inescapable and everything seems to lead back to the disappearance of a teenager years earlier. &lt;br /&gt;Then the main suspect vanishes.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Kate connect the events of past and present to bring the culprit to justice?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a family camping trip takes a dark turn, how far will one mother go to keep her family safe?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling with working-mother guilt, Marlene Greene hopes a camping trip in the forest will provide quality time with her three young children—until they see fires in the distance, columns of smoke distorting the sweeping view. Overnight, all communication with the outside world is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing something terrible has happened, Marlene suspects that the isolation of the remote campsite is all that’s protecting her family. But the arrival of a lost boy reveals they are not alone in the woods, and as the unfolding disaster ravages the land, more youngsters seek refuge under her wing. The lives of her own children aren’t the only ones at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When their sanctuary is threatened, Marlene faces the mother of all dilemmas: Should she save her own kids or try to save them all?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;She knew it was a weird place. She’d heard the stories, seen the movies, read the books. But now police Chief Inspector Sigrid Ødegård has to leave her native Norway and actually go there; to that land across the Atlantic where her missing brother is implicated in the mysterious death of a prominent African-American academic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And not someplace interesting, either: upstate New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is election season, 2008, and Sigrid is plunged into a United States where race and identity, politics and promise, reverberate in every aspect of daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find her older brother, she needs the help of the local police who appear to have already made up their minds about the case. Working with - or, if necessary, against — someone actually named Sheriff Irving 'Irv' Wylie, she must negotiate the local political minefields and navigate the back woods of the Adirondacks to uncover the truth before events escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once a thrilling race-against-time crime story, a personal journey through grief and a meditation on the world in which we live, &lt;i&gt;American By Day&lt;/i&gt; once again shows Derek B Miller to be one of the most imaginative, ingenious and entertaining writers working today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>At long last, Mary Beard addresses in one brave book the misogynists and trolls who mercilessly attack and demean women the world over, including, very often, Mary herself. In &lt;em&gt;Women &amp;amp; Power&lt;/em&gt;, she traces the origins of this misogyny to its ancient roots, examining the pitfalls of gender and the ways that history has mistreated strong women since time immemorial. As far back as Homer’s &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, Beard shows, women have been prohibited from leadership roles in civic life, public speech being defined as inherently male. From Medusa to Philomela (whose tongue was cut out), from Hillary Clinton to Elizabeth Warren (who was told to sit down), Beard draws illuminating parallels between our cultural assumptions about women’s relationship to power—and how powerful women provide a necessary example for all women who must resist being vacuumed into a male template. With personal reflections on her own online experiences with sexism, Beard asks: If women aren’t perceived to be within the structure of power, isn’t it power itself we need to redefine? And how many more centuries should we be expected to wait?</description>

  <description>When Marianne comes home from work one day to find her husband talking to a glamorous woman in the kitchen, insecurities resurface from a time when she was bullied at school. Jealousy rears its head and her marriage begins to fall apart. Desperate for a solution, she finds herself trying to track down her first schoolgirl crush: Edward Harvey. Even thinking his name made her tingle with half-remembered childlike giddiness. Edward Harvey, the only one from Brocklebank to whom she might write if she found him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Lydia is a book about childhood bullying, midlife crises, obsession, jealousy and the ever-growing trend of Internet relationships. It will appeal to fans of character-driven fiction and those interested in the dynamics and psychology of relationships.</description>

I spent many a summer holiday there as a child and teen (and it is a fair old schlep from the North East of England let me tell you).

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A tough-as-nails businesswoman. An arrogant Navy SEAL. A power struggle with no end in sight.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people hook-up at weddings. Others break a hotel room bed (and a table, and a desk, and some complimentary bathrobe belts) and discover they've been surviving on bargain basement orgasms their entire lives.&lt;br /&gt;The last one? Yeah. That's all me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's driven and demanding...I wasn't always a bitch. There's a dirty little trick to succeeding in business: the sweet and innocent rarely survive. I fought my way up from nothing, and I don't bend for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Will Halsted ties me to a headboard and makes me his...for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wild, filthy night turns into another, and then...we can't stop. Each time we're together is more addictive than the last, but it's nothing more than a sexy escape from reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's never walked away from a challenge...I wasn't always a warrior but now it's in my bones and blood. That's what years spent in the Special Forces does to a man. My entire life is classified: where I've been, what I've seen, what I've done, and there's no mission too dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I realize that falling for Shannon Walsh is like trying to swim against a riptide. She's going to tear me up and toss me to the shore, and I'll love every minute of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I'm down range, I want her counting the hours until I'm back. Waiting for me. She's done it before; she'll do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They're wrong for each other in every possible way...&lt;br /&gt;Or are they?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE FEED by Nick Clark Windo is a startling and timely debut which presents a world as unique and vividly imagined as STATION ELEVEN and THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS and explores what it is to be human in the digital age.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It makes us. It destroys us.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feed is everywhere. It can be accessed by anyone, at any time. Every interaction, every emotion, every image can be shared through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom and Kate use The Feed, but they have resisted addiction to it. And this will serve them well when The Feed collapses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until their six-year-old daughter, Bea, goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because how do you find someone in a world devoid of technology? And what happens when you can no longer trust that your loved ones are really who they claim to be?</description>

  <description>They liked to call me names. Manwhore. Slut. Player. But I make wrong look so right…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He's a flawed perfectionist…&lt;br /&gt;I can read women better than any blueprint. I understand their thoughts and feelings, their secret desires and insecurities, and I know how to get rid of them once I get off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But all bets are off when Tiel Desai slams into my life. She redefines what it means to be friends, and she makes it sound like the filthiest thing I've ever heard.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can't read the gorgeous conservatory-trained violinist, but she's the only one keeping me from shattering by small degrees, and I can't let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She's wildly independent… &lt;br /&gt;My past—and New Jersey—are far behind me, and now my life is blissfully full of music: playing, teaching, and lecturing, and scouring Boston's underground scene with an annoyingly beautiful, troubled, tattooed architect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm defenseless against his rooftop kisses, our nearly naked dance parties, the snuggletimes that turn into sexytimes, and his deep, demanding voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Sam Walsh stuck in my head like a song on repeat, and I'm happy pretending history won't catch up with me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one thing they have in common is a rock-solid disregard for the rules.&lt;br /&gt;They find more in each other than they ever realized they were missing, but they might have to fall apart before they can come together.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's the wrongs that make the rights come to life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some lines are meant to be crossed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patrick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hair. That fucking hair. It was everywhere, always, and I wanted to tangle my fingers in those dark curls and pull. And that would be fine if she wasn't my apprentice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Asani was nothing like I expected. She was exotic and scary-brilliant, and the slightest murmur from those lips sent hot, hungry lust swirling through my veins. Outside my siblings, she was the only person I could name who shared my obsession with preserving Boston's crumbling buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wants were few: good eats, tall boots, hot yoga, interesting work. One incredibly hot architect with the most expressive hazel eyes I ever encountered and entirely too much talent in and out of the bedroom wasn't part of the original plan. Apparently he was part of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine was my rabbi and vodka was my therapist, and I needed plenty of both to survive my apprenticeship. Especially with Patrick Walsh leaving love notes in the form of bite marks all over my body.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If I had known I'd have a hot architect balls deep inside of me before the end of the weekend, I'd have made time for a pedicure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's all the little things—the action plans, the long-kept promises—that started falling apart when my life slipped into controlled chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I met Matthew Walsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't decide whether I wanted to run screaming or rip his pants off, and most days I wanted a little of both. If I was being honest with myself, it was rip his pants off, ride him like a workhorse, and then run screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rebellious streak ran through Lauren Halsted. It was fierce and unrelentingly beautiful, and woven through too many good girl layers to count, and she wasn't letting anyone tell her what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless, of course, she was naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wasn't looking for me and I sure as shit wasn't looking for her, but we found each other anyway and now we were locked in a battle of wills, waiting for the other to blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes the universe conspires to bring people together. Other times, it throws people down a flight of stairs and leaves them in a bruised and bloodied heap.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Taster answers the question, "Who killed Adolf Hitler?" It is a sweeping, epic novel, set in the most turbulent of times, filled with intrigue and terror, and, ultimately, acts of courage, self-sacrifice, and love.Magda Ritter's parents send her to southern Germany after the start of the Allied bombings on Berlin. Magda's uncle arranges an interview with the Nazi civil service, and she is chosen as a food taster at the Berghof, Hitler's mountain retreat. Her job is to keep the dictator from being poisoned. There she meets an SS captain, Karl Weber, a conspirator, who shows her photographic proof of Nazi atrocities. As her love for Karl blossoms, Magda is convinced that Hitler's Reich must be destroyed. From her food-taster training at the Berghof to her first attempt to kill the German leader, Magda's life is populated by those who blindly serve Hitler and those who want him to die.Karl disappears after he is implicated in the bomb plot to end the tyrant's life at the Wolf's Lair. A cruel officer sends Magda to a women's concentration camp where she experiences the same horrors as the inmates. She is later released and returns to the Wolf's Lair as the Russian army advances. She escapes to Berlin, a city under siege, where she confronts Hitler in his final hours in his bunker under the Chancellery.</description>

  <description>One morning, Deming Guo’s mother, an undocumented Chinese immigrant named Polly, goes to her job at the nail salon and never comes home. No one can find any trace of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his mother gone, eleven-year-old Deming is left with no one to care for him. He is eventually adopted by two white college professors who move him from the Bronx to a small town upstate. They rename him Daniel Wilkinson in their efforts to make him over into their version of an “all-American boy.” But far away from all he’s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his new life with his mother’s disappearance and the memories of the family and community he left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in New York and China, &lt;i&gt;The Leavers&lt;/i&gt; is a vivid and moving examination of borders and belonging. It’s the story of how one boy comes into his own when everything he’s loved has been taken away--and how a mother learns to live with the mistakes of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful debut is the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for fiction, awarded by Barbara Kingsolver for a novel that addresses issues of social justice.</description>

  <description>Après Block 46, le duo d'enquêtrices Emily Roy (profileuse de renom) et Alexis Castells (écrivaine de true crime) revient pour une enquête terrifiante qui explore, cette fois encore, l'histoire et les liens familiaux. On retrouve, en Suède, un cadavre de femme amputé de plusieurs kilos de chair. Au même moment, à Londres, Emily Roy enquête sur une disparition inquiétante : une actrice célèbre a été enlevée, et ses chaussures abandonnées à proximité de son domicile, dans un sac plastique, avec une paire de chaussettes soigneusement pliées dedans. Ces deux crimes portent la signature du serial killer qui a tué l'ancien compagnon d'Alexis Castells au moment de son arrestation : Richard Hemfield. Hemfield est enfermé à vie à l'hôpital psychiatrique de haute sécurité de Broadmoor, pour le meurtre de six femmes, retrouvées, en l'espace de deux ans, assassinées et amputées de leurs seins, de leurs fesses, de leurs cuisses et de leurs hanches... Le problème, c'est que Richard Hemfield est en prison depuis dix ans. Comment expliquer que ses crimes recommencent ? Le nouveau roman de Johana Gustawsson plonge cette fois encore ses racines dans l'histoire : au cœur du Londres du XIXe siècle, dans les ruelles sillonnées par Jack L'Éventreur.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens to those kids at school who are always being tipped to be stars in adult life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a question all of us find ourselves asking at some time and Mike Gayle's powerful, poignant novel answers it with regard to Danny Morgan and James McManus - rivals for top honours in everything throughout their school years in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever their friends and teachers might have expected, neither Danny nor James is currently running the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressed and unemployed, Danny is facing an ultimatum from his girlfriend Maya: if he doesn't get out and get a job, she's leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an accident that changed James's life and now he is looked after affectionately by his parents. But his sister Martha believes that the role of full-time carers is destroying their lives - and infantilising her brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests that James should go into a respite home while her parents take a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The respite home, as it turns out, where Danny has just got a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the path that has brought these two people to this unexpected place, and where will it take them next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Danny and James, but also of the families who love them and of the women they love. It is a story of many surprising twists, by turns funny and sad, painful and uplifting, and marks a brilliant new stage in the writing career of one of Britain's favourite novelists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When a dead man is lifted from the freezing waters of Oslo Harbour just before Christmas, Detective Lena Stigersand’s stressful life suddenly becomes even more complicated. Not only is she dealing with a cancer scare, a stalker and an untrustworthy boyfriend, but it seems both a politician and Norway’s security services might be involved in the murder. &lt;br /&gt;With her trusted colleagues, Gunnarstranda and Frølich, at her side, Lena digs deep into the case and finds that it not only goes to the heart of the Norwegian establishment, but it might be rather to close to her personal life for comfort. Dark, complex and nail-bitingly tense, &lt;i&gt;The Ice Swimmer&lt;/i&gt; is the latest and most unforgettable instalment in the critically acclaimed Oslo Detective series, by the godfather of Nordic Noir. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The last person Alice Shipley expected to see since arriving in Tangier with her new husband was Lucy Mason. After the accident at Bennington, the two friends—once inseparable roommates—haven’t spoken in over a year. But there Lucy was, trying to make things right and return to their old rhythms. Perhaps Alice should be happy. She has not adjusted to life in Morocco, too afraid to venture out into the bustling medinas and oppressive heat. Lucy—always fearless and independent—helps Alice emerge from her flat and explore the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon a familiar feeling starts to overtake Alice—she feels controlled and stifled by Lucy at every turn. Then Alice’s husband, John, goes missing, and Alice starts to question everything around her: her relationship with her enigmatic friend, her decision to ever come to Tangier, and her very own state of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tangerine&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp dagger of a book—a debut so tightly wound, so replete with exotic imagery and charm, so full of precise details and extraordinary craftsmanship, it will leave you absolutely breathless.</description>

  <description>The patient has a story that isn’t told and which no one knows of. It is the secret, the rock against which he is shattered. Carl Jung&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great War is over but for Edith Potter an equally devastating conflict is about to begin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is unhinged by a secret so terrible her conscious mind doesn’t acknowledge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1927 and Dr Stephen Maynard is using the new science of psychoanalysis to restore her sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his first meeting with her in the lunatic asylum, Dr Stephen Maynard is determined to bring her back to reality. During the long challenge, her disturbed behaviour forces him to confront his limitations – already severely stretched by the presence of someone prepared to use whatever weapons they can to ensure she maintains her silence.</description>

  <description>If you knew the date of your death, how would you live your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die. The Gold children—four adolescents on the cusp of self-awareness—sneak out to hear their fortunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prophecies inform their next five decades. Golden-boy Simon escapes to the West Coast, searching for love in '80s San Francisco; dreamy Klara becomes a Las Vegas magician, obsessed with blurring reality and fantasy; eldest son Daniel seeks security as an army doctor post-9/11; and bookish Varya throws herself into longevity research, where she tests the boundary between science and immortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping novel of remarkable ambition and depth, &lt;i&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/i&gt; probes the line between destiny and choice, reality and illusion, this world and the next. It is a deeply moving testament to the power of story, the nature of belief, and the unrelenting pull of familial bonds.</description>

  <description>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exit West&lt;/i&gt; follows these characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely of our time and for all time.</description>

  <description>The worlds of arms dealing, espionage and TV cookery collide in this fast moving comedy caper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failing celebrity agent Dermot Jack thinks his luck might have turned when a mysterious Russian oligarch hires him to represent his pop star daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disaffected MI5 officer Anna Preston is just as happy to be handed the chance to resurrect her own career. Little do they know that their paths are about to cross again after seventeen years as they're thrown together in a desperate attempt to lure a notorious arms dealer into a highly unusual trap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard enough without having to deal with the lecherous celebrity chef trying to save his daytime TV career or the diminutive mafia enforcer who definitely has his own agenda. Then there's the very impatient loan shark who 'just wants his money back'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Anna's bosses are hardly playing it straight either. But one thing's for sure. There'll be winners and losers when the Meal of Fortune finally stops spinning. Oh, and another thing, Anna and Dermot are absolutely not about to fall in love again. That's never going to happen, OK</description>

  <description>Truth lingers in murky waters…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Montrealer Catherine Day sets foot in a remote fishing village and starts asking around about her birth mother, the body of a woman dredges up in a fisherman’s nets. Not just any woman, though: Marie Garant, an elusive, nomadic sailor and unbridled beauty who once tied many a man’s heart in knots. Detective Sergeant Joaquin Moralès, newly drafted to the area from the suburbs of Montreal, barely has time to unpack his suitcase before he’s thrown into the deep end of the investigation.&lt;br /&gt; On Quebec’s outlying Gaspé Peninsula, the truth can be slippery, especially down on the fishermen’s wharves. Interviews drift into idle chit-chat, evidence floats off with the tide and the truth lingers in murky waters. It’s enough to make DS Moralès reach straight for a large whisky…&lt;br /&gt; Both a dark and consuming crime thriller and a lyrical, poetic ode to the sea, &lt;i&gt;We Were the Salt&lt;/i&gt; of the Sea is a stunning, page-turning novel, from one of the most exciting new names in crime fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Colourful, authentic characters with the kind of flavour that can only be inspired by real locals. So good it’ll make you want to pack your bags and drive straight to the seaside’ &lt;i&gt;Journal de Montréal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Lyrical and elegiac, full of quirks and twists’ William Ryan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Wonderfully atmospheric … I genuinely couldn’t put this book down’ Gill Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘Asks questions right from page one’ Quentin Bates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘An isolated Canadian fishing community, a missing mother, and some lovely prose. Very impressed by this debut so far’ Eva Dolan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 'A tour de force of both writing and translation’ Su Bristow</description>

  <description>Novelist Sarah Moss had a childhood dream of moving to Iceland, sustained by a wild summer there when she was nineteen. In 2009, she saw an advertisement for a job at the University of Iceland and applied on a whim, despite having two young children and a comfortable life in an English cathedral city. The resulting adventure was shaped by Iceland's economic collapse, which halved the value of her salary, by the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull and by a collection of new friends, including a poet who saw the only bombs fall on Iceland in 1943, a woman who speaks to elves and a chef who guided Sarah's family around the intricacies of Icelandic cuisine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah was drawn to the strangeness of Icelandic landscape, and explored hillsides of boiling mud, volcanic craters and fissures, and the unsurfaced roads that link remote farms and fishing villages in the far north. She walked the coast path every night after her children were in bed, watching the northern lights and the comings and goings of migratory birds. As the weeks and months went by, the children settled in local schools and Sarah got to know her students and colleagues, she and her family learned new ways to live.</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>A gripping story of obsession and betrayal, privilege and hypocrisy, set in the unassailable heart of the British establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As the train pressed on, I realised that my life was in the process of taking a different direction, plotted according to a new constellation. Because, although I didn't know it yet, I was about to meet Ben and nothing would ever be the same again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin Gilmour is an outsider. When he wins a scholarship to Burtonbury School, he doesn’t wear the right clothes or speak with the right kind of accent. But then he meets the dazzling, popular and wealthy Ben Fitzmaurice, and gains admission to an exclusive world. Soon Martin is enjoying tennis parties and Easter egg hunts at the Fitzmaurice family’s estate, as Ben becomes the brother he never had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Martin has a secret. He knows something about Ben, something he will never tell. It is a secret that will bind the two of them together for the best part of 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Ben’s 40th birthday party, the great and the good of British society are gathering to celebrate in a haze of champagne, drugs and glamour. Amid the hundreds of guests–the politicians, the celebrities, the old-money and newly rich–Martin once again feels that disturbing pang of not-quite belonging. His wife, Lucy, has her reservations too. There is disquiet in the air. But Ben wouldn’t do anything to damage their friendship. Would he?</description>

  <description>A singularly inventive and unforgettable debut novel about love, luck, and the inextricability of life and art, from 2017 Whiting Award winner Lisa Halliday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in three distinct and uniquely compelling sections, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetry&lt;/i&gt; explores the imbalances that spark and sustain many of our most dramatic human relations: inequities in age, power, talent, wealth, fame, geography, and justice. The first section, &lt;i&gt;Folly&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Alice, a young American editor, and her relationship with the famous and much older writer Ezra Blazer. A tender and exquisite account of an unexpected romance that takes place in New York during the early years of the Iraq War, &lt;i&gt;Folly&lt;/i&gt; also suggests an aspiring novelist’s coming-of-age. By contrast, &lt;i&gt;Madness&lt;/i&gt; is narrated by Amar, an Iraqi-American man who, on his way to visit his brother in Kurdistan, is detained by immigration officers and spends the last weekend of 2008 in a holding room in Heathrow. These two seemingly disparate stories gain resonance as their perspectives interact and overlap, with yet new implications for their relationship revealed in an unexpected coda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunning debut from a rising literary star, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetry&lt;/i&gt; is an urgent, important, and truly original work that will captivate any reader while also posing arresting questions about the very nature of fiction itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Take a vacation, &lt;/i&gt; they said. &lt;i&gt; Get away from Silicon Valley's back-stabbing and power-grabbing. Recharge the innovative batteries. Unwind, then come back stronger than ever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got lost at sea and fell in love with an anti-social lobsterman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's one small issue: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen Bartlett doesn't know who I am. Who I really am. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't like people.&lt;br /&gt;I avoid small talk and socializing, and I kick my companions out of bed before the sun rises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;No strings, no promises, no problems. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Cole McClish's boat drifts into Talbott's Cove, and I bend all my rules for the sexy sailor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't know Cole's story or what he's running from, but one thing is certain: &lt;br /&gt;I'm not letting him run away from me. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Fresh Catch is a standalone novel. A portion of this novel appeared in the 2016 anthology INCOGNITO. The story has been substantially expanded. &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>What happens to a story when it ends too soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eva and Adam fall into bed one Friday night, tired and happy after drinks with friends, they have their whole lives ahead of them. But then their story ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I Lose You is a love story told backwards – the story of Eva and Adam, which is warmer and funnier and more beautiful because we know it is going to be interrupted. It’s a story Eva thought she knew – but as she will discover, it’s not just the ending of the story that she got wrong.</description>

  <description>At a secret masked ball at Yale, Naomi Costa is literally swept off her stiletto-blistered feet by a man with a killer jawline, a perfect body, and an even-better kiss. They bust out of an emergency exit and have axis-shaking sex. He pours whiskey in her belly button and after they run out of condoms, they have to get creative. That kind of sex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next day, she learns that he is none other than Dr. Benjamin Beck, a brand new member of the Yale faculty and the hottest thing to happen to academia since… well, ever. She has to take his damned junior seminar to graduate, but it gets worse. He’s also her College Master: her boss, her advisor, her everything. And he’s just moved in, right downstairs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They can’t stay away from each other. They're either fusion or fission or both. They’re making out in libraries, hiding notes between stones, and sneaking off to nautically themed AirBnbs. Hear that sound? It’s the academic code of ethics going up in flames.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If they're found out, he’ll lose his job and his reputation. She'll lose her scholarship and be forced to return to the life of lobster fishing that she thought she’d escaped.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And they will be found out, yes they will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what the hell are they going to do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To the reader: Things get damned dirty in this book. The characters curse, the sex gets explicit. It’s an erotic love story with fury. Be advised.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other tasters’ notes: HEA. Sweet. Funny. Dirty. Muddy. Wet. Inspired by a real professor.</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code: little chalk stick figures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the same message, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.</description>

  <description>Twas the weekend before Christmas, when all through the North End &lt;br /&gt;Not a Walsh had his life together, not even his friends; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The parties were planned by the foodies with care, &lt;br /&gt;In hopes that Wes and Erin would soon find their way there; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The men were stressing over last minute shopping lists and plans, &lt;br /&gt;While the ladies were busy with work and nesting and finding the right paella pans; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When out in the dining room there arose such a clatter, &lt;br /&gt;The Halsted dogs sprang from their beds to see what was the matter; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They whistled and shouted and called each other names, &lt;br /&gt;While the secrets and announcements and surprises quickly came; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So onto another adventure they flew &lt;br /&gt;With the sleigh full of Walshes, and the Commodore too— &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they continued arguing and clamoring around, &lt;br /&gt;Down the road an unexpected visitor came with a bound; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it wasn't long until couples were all nestled snug in their beds, &lt;br /&gt;With new memories of steamy holiday nights dancing in their heads.</description>
