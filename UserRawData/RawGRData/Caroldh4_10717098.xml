      <![CDATA[An Unexpected Gift is book four in the Insta-Spark Collection series by Melanie Moreland. Each of these can be read as a stand alone. Every one of these is sure to melt your heart into a bunch of ooey-gooey goodness. But there is something about this one. I think it’s my favorite of the bunch. <br /><br /> <img alt="snowy detour sign" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9e/ad/04/9ead0411d85166a04bf6d4c62d7de432.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /><br /><br />E...]]>

  <description>A small Wyoming town is about to learn a few lessons -- from a new schoolteacher with the courage to win the heart of a man who swore he had nothing to give...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Elizabeth Potter is a self-appointed spinster with no illusions about love. But she is a good teacher -- and she wants Wolf MacKenzie's son back in school. And after one heated confrontation with the boy's father, she knows father and son have changed her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still paying for a crime he didn't commit, Wolf MacKenzie has a chip on his shoulder the size of Wyoming. But prim-and-proper Mary Elizabeth Potter doesn't see Wolf as the dangerous half-breed the town has branded him. Somehow she sees him as a good, decent, honest man. A man who could love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf's not sure he -- or the town of Ruth, Wyoming -- is ready for the taming of Wolf MacKenzie.</description>

  <description>Maxine “Pumpkin” Novak is coming home to Chicago to do three things: eat turkey with her family; chill with her best friend, Joy; and avoid all the awful people who gave her that childhood nickname. But a run-in with a dreamy old classmate sidetracks her plans in a heartbeat, and gets her heart pounding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bartender Talbot “Stoner” Spice has out-performed his high school epithet and whooped his childhood demons. Dividing all his time between running the neighborhood bar and caring for his widowed mother, he has never seen the need for a serious relationship. That all changes when his high school crush, Max, returns from California and walks into his bar two days before Thanksgiving. She doesn’t know it yet, but she’s not getting away from him again. &lt;br /&gt;Get ready for a full plate of hot, yummy Thanksgiving naughtiness that will melt your heart and leave you begging for more. This book is a safe read, containing NO CHEATING, a GUARANTEED HAPPY ENDING and no relationship cliffhangers! &lt;br /&gt;And don’t forget Max's best friend Joy, who gets her own story in the second installment of this two-part holiday treat, Comfort and Joy, releasing Dec. 21, 2018!</description>

  <description>The NHL’s most charming player is ready to score a hat trick on and off the ice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the star forward for the Boston Blades, I’ve earned a reputation for no-strings attached hookups and a mean slapshot that has all the ladies purring -- but it’s never been the one woman I want to see all fired up and ready to score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston’s own Ice Queen Gwen James has had my emotions all tangled up for years. I’ve played the games. I’ve sat on the sidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter her reasons, I’m done being benched. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she approaches me for a second chance, I accept on one condition: she’s got to prove she’s all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kissing. No sex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just might kill me to keep my hands to myself, but it’s time Gwen knows what it’s like to beg. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I play to win, and I want what no other man has ever had…her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How insane is it to marry an alien as a publicity stunt?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Sunny Weathers. You probably recognize me from my reality show, Sunny Weathers Excellent Adventures. I’ve had to perform a lot of crazy stunts in my career but this one takes the cake! The producers are sending me to another planet to become an alien’s mail order bride. I’m not allowed to tell anybody it’s a put-on, and as soon my contract is up, I’ll be leaving planet Dakon. Unfortunately, I hadn’t counted on my attraction to Mr. Tall, “Darq” and Handsome… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Darq. The moment I laid eyes on the female with pretty mud-colored hair and sunny smile, I knew she was mine. Competition for females is fierce, and I was determined to claim a mate from the latest shipment from Earth so I broke the rules. If anyone finds out, my own brother would banish me to the icy wilderness, and I’d lose my mate. I will do anything to keep her…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A standalone Halloween tale with a hot AF ghost!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie Nolan is stuck for yet another summer working in the family business: leading groups of tourists down to the haunted pier to witness the nightly visit of the ghost known as Old Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Old Salt really is a ghost—a young sea captain who died in 1879.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, he clanks his chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tourists are always amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because really, chains? Could he try for a more original haunting technique? Or just give it up already?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And okay, maybe she insults Old Salt when the tourists aren’t around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never thought he was listening. Or that he had a few of his own thoughts about her attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she never in a million years imagined he was soooooo hot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A previous version of this appeared in The Mammoth Book of Ghost Romance&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Hot Ghost is a stand alone novella by Annika Martin. This is the second thing I have read by Annika.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This holiday season, there’s more than gingerbread in the oven.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was always a type-A kind of girl— and that’s exactly what got me into trouble with Sterling Ahren. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a baby before thirty didn’t work out, so I took some time off to sort out my life. Sterling’s my new landlord… and he doesn’t plan anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a billionaire playboy who can’t stand the holidays. A recluse of the worst kind, Sterling makes Scrooge look like a generous soul… except Ebenezer was never this sexy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t want a family— until the night we have a spontaneous one-night stand, and forget to use condoms. I can’t have a baby with a disorganized, free spirit like him. Between my overprotective brothers and his crazy fans, I already know this isn’t going to work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Sterling isn’t willing to let me go. He wants me home for the holidays… and this is my last chance to make a Christmas miracle happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I know for sure: when Sterling and I collide, it’s going to be anything but a silent night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funny, touching, and delightful, this smoking hot billionaire holiday rom-com by Claudia Burgoa will make you feel the magic of Christmas. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Her love could set me free from the shadows... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing CoCo Becket for the first time, made my heart start beating again. It changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before her I had no purpose, no reason to live. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met, I couldn't help but fantasize about kissing her plump lips or having those sky blue eyes staring back at mine, seeing beyond what I truly was. Broken and ashamed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My desire for her ran deep, deeper than I expected it too. She was a Goddess and I was simply caught up in her glow, I couldn't say no. Not to her kindness, and not to my need to be near her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoCo was the good in life where I was the bad. She became the sun to my never ending darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious situation brings us together, I discover that I'll do anything to keep her safe. Even if it means risking my own life, to save hers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because before her, love was just a word I'd heard in passing…and now I'll destroy anyone that tries to take her, or that love away from me.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;This bad boy hockey player is about to meet his match...&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling down is an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying down is a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going down&lt;/em&gt; is a career-changer … that’s the one &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How was I supposed to know that the NHL’s toughest enforcer, the Red Wings’ laundry room, and one security video would be my downfall? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent more time in the penalty box than any other player in the NHL, but this time I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; screwed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How was I supposed to know that one night and one choice would be worse than all of my transgressions on the ice? Now, I’ve lost my team, my sponsors, and my publicist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, it’s bend or break. For me, it’s melt or harden. My decision became obvious when I walked into my new PR firm, and &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was sitting behind the desk.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Hot on the ice and tall in the saddle...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rancher and hockey coach Logan Rivers' attempts to hire a housekeeper are hindered by women more interested in marriage than meal-planning. So when snarky Harper Evans arrives with zero romantic interest in him, he couldn't be happier. But as he gets to know her, he finds himself hungering for more than her cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down-on-her-luck single mom Harper Evans came to Colorado with one goal: to find her son and bring him home. Temporary work for a local rancher seems perfect, but to keep the job she has to deny her feelings for the hot cowboy who's heating up her kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan's secret learning disability has caused a financial mistake that could cost him everything. With the holidays approaching and a storm closing in, he and Harper have to save his ranch and fight for her son. But can Harper trust the cowboy who is offering her both a home--and his heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cowboys of Creedence series: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caught Up in a Cowboy (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt; You Had Me at Cowboy (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt; It Started With a Cowboy (Book 3)&lt;br /&gt;Wish Upon a Cowboy (Book 4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Jennie Marts: &lt;br /&gt; "Readers will cherish the scorching sex, snappy dialogue, well-paced plot, and small Colorado town setting." --&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;em&gt;You Had Me at Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Funny, complicated, and irresistible." --&lt;strong&gt;JODI THOMAS&lt;/strong&gt;, New York Times bestselling author fo&lt;em&gt;r Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Full of exquisite heat and passion...wonderful." --&lt;em&gt;Harlequin Junkie&lt;/em&gt; for&lt;em&gt; Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>What do you do when the Angel of Death asks you to steal from one of the most powerful covens in the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You leave the celestial realm, give up your wings, and sneak into the coven's lair while they're all partying it up in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, at least that was Maddox Calder's plan. Until a curse leaves him dazed—and in the path of an oncoming car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killian Wade loathes being a rare, male witch. Especially one who can't control his power. After the death of his mentor—at his hand—Killian prefers to hide away at his Brighton estate. It's safer for everyone. But he's been summoned to New Orleans, and the last witch to refuse such an invitation was never heard from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hit by a curse after only half a glass of wine, Killian flees, but finds a handsome, broken man in the street, begging for help. Something about Maddox calls to him, and though he's a danger to everyone he meets, he can't leave Mad to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cursed to face their greatest fears, the two men know only one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're stronger together than they are apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicked Omens is the fifth book in the Cursed Coven series and is a male/male romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Samhain night the covens gather under a Harvest Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a time for pure magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A night of unbridled witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A celebration of all they are and all they will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s a dark force lurking, hiding, plotting. A rogue determined to curse every witch at the gathering. When she does, no one escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face their darkest fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survive or die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the stories of thirteen witches cursed at the one place they should have found sanctuary.</description>

  <description>Crystal Cove is about as safe a place you can find. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria Lowe doesn't know if she believes that. She hates change, and lately there's been plenty of it going on around her small town. Aria doesn't like change; it terrifies her. Aria doesn't need to explore things or spread her wings; what if she fell instead of flew? Imagine how surprised she is when cocky but sweet Gabe Holmes makes her feel like she's soaring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe has lived life loud and large just about long enough-he spent most his life on the go. A stop in Crystal Cove brings sweet, gentle, and sexy-as-sin Aria Lowe into his sights. But, Gabe's all about change and Aria has no room for that in her orderly life. Can Gabe prove to her you can stand still, and fly free at the same time?</description>

  <description>Starting over at thirty-two is never fun, especially in a town the size of a postage stamp. Chasing that with having to beg for a job she’s wildly over-qualified for and Walker Wilder’s pride is really burned. But now that she’s the new events director for the historic Montana Graff Hotel, she’s tasked with creating buzz and traditions to fill rooms during the off-season. Halloween may not scream touristy, but hiring a spirit-hunting TV crew will definitely grab some headlines... But when the sexy spirit hunter shows up, he haunts more than her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calum Quest is done. He’s created an entertainment empire by chasing something he’s never seen and is tired of asking questions with no answers. His life has been defined by ghosts he needs to exorcise, yet, when a red-haired, grey-eyed beauty with a body that melts his mind pours him a double shot of Laphroaig whiskey and challenges him to one more round, how can he say no?</description>

  <description>There is something magical about Halloween… &lt;br /&gt;Jerry Finney is a no-nonsense detective who believes in facts and hard evidence. But all of Finn’s beliefs are challenged when he gets thrown into a ghostly mystery on Halloween night with the sexy psychic whose office is down the hall from his. &lt;br /&gt;A self-proclaimed psychic and white witch, Zia is surprised to find herself attracted to the boring uptight private eye next door. When their offices are ransacked, the unlikely pair must team up in order to catch the paranormal perpetrator. &lt;br /&gt;As Finn and Zia share one spooky and sexy night complete with a stakeout, a dead body, a zombie, black lace undies, and some chocolate cupcakes, everything they believe is tested. Will this mismatched pair be able to ‘see’ beyond their differences to solve the ghostly murder and make a spiritual connection? If Finn and Zia can open up to one another, risking their hearts in the process, they just might find love is the greatest treat of all. &lt;br /&gt;Fans of paranormal romance who love mysteries, ghosts, psychics, and tough but tender detectives, will love this enemies-to-lovers Halloween novella. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This Halloween, opposites attract...but is it all a trick, or the perfect treat?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tristan is a brilliant, rich playboy. It’s Freshman year, and he knows exactly which fraternity he’s going to end up in--the one his father picked out for him, at least if he wants to keep his trust fund. He hates most of the asshole jocks in the frat, especially Warren--they have history. There may be one saving grace in all of it: a handsome new football player catches his eye. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grant is different from most of the other guys on the football team. He grew up poor, and he has big dreams--working his way through school, earning his scholarship, true love. He definitely isn’t going to give it away to some rich asshole frat boy. It would be good if he got into the same fraternity as all the other jocks, though. Somehow, he’s got to survive their hazing, but if Warren and his frat brothers have their way, Grant won’t last till Halloween. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would you rather have a &lt;i&gt;Trick or Treat&lt;/i&gt;? Try it both ways in this 55,000 word college Halloween special from Riley Knight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book is a standalone gay romance intended for adult audiences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; Everyone should have a chance at forever . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty-Five Years.&lt;/i&gt; That's how long Odette Peterson called Austin Andrews her best friend. Until he let his mouth ruin it--in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Five Minutes.&lt;/i&gt; That's all it took for their friendship to fall apart, leaving her heart a little broken and her life a little emptier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Hour&lt;/i&gt;. That's the amount of time she agrees to give him to try and find his way back into her good graces. Not that she thinks for even one minute that it might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It won't, because . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forever&lt;/i&gt;. That's what Odette's looking for. Someone to spend her life with; someone who'll see her as more than just one of the guys. And there's not a thing Austin can do to stop her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Except maybe tell her that he loves her . . . &lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;How long does it take to fall in love?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca Evers learned the hard way—after thirteen years with her ex-husband—that not even half a lifetime of love is enough to save her from heartbreak. So the idea of falling for someone in less than fifteen hours? &lt;i&gt;Impossible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Hawke is under no illusion that the beautiful American he fell for on their flight to Australia feels the same. She might want him—but just like the women in his past, she’s only thinking of right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But sometimes fate intervenes. &lt;br /&gt;And sometimes someone arrives in your life who is meant to stay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;They say time flies when you’re having fun, but what about when you’re falling in love?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca Evers is recovering from the end of her marriage to her college sweetheart when she’s seated next to the sexiest man she’s ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Hawke is flying home to Australia, still dreaming of something more with the right person when he encounters a beautiful woman with sad eyes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And now they only have fifteen hours to figure out if their connection is worth upgrading—or just a layover in life . . .&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>KING’S (Book 1): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I am the man who can find anything or anyone. For a price. And my price is you.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Mia Turner’s brother goes missing in Mexico, while on an archaeological dig, she believes that life couldn’t get much worse. But when she’s blocked at every turn from finding answers, by both local and U.S. authorities, she must turn to a man she swears is the devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Others might be fooled by his private jet, fine tailored suits, and disarming smile, but Mia knows something dark, sinister, and unnatural lurks behind those penetrating, pale-gray eyes. And the more she learns, the more she realizes she may never be free again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KING FOR A DAY (Book 2): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King isn’t who she thought. She wasn’t even close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Mia Turner’s life becomes tethered to a mysterious billionaire, who she swears is the devil himself, she knows she must break free. It doesn’t matter if everything about him—those sinful lips, those pale gray eyes, that perfect male body—keeps her awake at night. He’s evil. She has to get away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when this man, known simply as King, suddenly disappears, Mia will discover she’s not home free. Because without King, she’s no longer safe from his ruthless, depraved, power-hungry social circle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To survive, Mia will have to conceal King’s absence and walk a mile in the evil man’s twisted, cruel shoes. What she discovers will leave her more terrified and her heart more conflicted than she ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King is not who she thought. She wasn’t even close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KING OF ME (Book 3): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“You’re asking me to…love you?” asked Mia. &lt;br /&gt;He slowly scratched his thick black stubble. “I suppose I am.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What if you were asked to love a dangerous man who betrayed you at every turn, who terrified you even in your sleep? Could you do it to save the people you hold dear? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mia Turner is ready to give it all—her body, her heart, her soul—to the mysterious, ruthless billionaire who holds the cards to saving her family. But when this sinfully sexy man, simply known as King, demands something more, something horrifying, Mia will be forced to face the impossible truth about their lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the truth brings salvation. And sometimes the truth breaks you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes MY PEN IS HUGE, a Standalone Romantic Comedy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Mr. Merrick,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since you’re obsessed with your stupid pen collection, I thought it appropriate to take the big one you love so much and write my resignation letter. Kiss your pen goodbye, big man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because when I agreed to work for you—a hotshot journalist I’ve admired for years—no one told me that you had a secret life and that you’d bug my apartment, have someone killed, and make the moves on me just to test whether I’m serious about this job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, come on! What kind of boss does that? Yes, you’re ten degrees hotter than the sun, and you melt panties everywhere you go, but this “little intern” is done with your games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this day forward, consider me your mortal enemy, your biggest threat. Maybe your pen is huge, but my determination is bigger. See you on the battlefield, Mr. Big Pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your ex-admirer, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gisselle Walters</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Experience the PERVADE DUET, a scorching ménage a trois romance encompassing two unforgettable contemporary novels from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestselling Author Vanessa Fewings.  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERVADE LONDON (Duet 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman's first ménage à trois romance with two mysterious British men with untold influence. Their love fuels the power that pervades London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an early age, Emily lived for the violin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practices were a joy. Recitals were a celebration. She only felt truly alive when the meticulously crafted, finely tuned, string instrument was in her firm grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could say that Emily lived for the violin, and that it was her true love. You would have been right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but that all changed the day she met Xander Rothschild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Rampling thought she understood the nature of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she didn't know the unexpected forms power could take, bending and adapting to suit its needs. She wasn't aware of the ways power could infiltrate unnoticed into the highest echelons of government, soaking the most hallowed chambers with its influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't realize the methods in which power could weave an invisible fabric that manipulated society with hidden secrets and unannounced agendas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Emily Rampling didn't understand anything at all about the nature of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she was about to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;pulse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;penetrate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;PERVADE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERVADE MONTEGO BAY (Duet 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every patch of sun, there's a pool of shadows. For every stretch of paradise, there's a stain of secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montego Bay offers everything the heart desires...and the soul fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Rampling once again finds herself in the throes of unforgettable passion and irresistible power as she dives deeper into the love of two men and the dangerous world they inhabit. James Ballad and Xavier Rothschild are not yet done with Emily. Not by a long shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But somewhere on the island of his birth, James is hiding something, a personal secret he seems to be guarding with his life. Emily becomes obsessed with finding out the truth, but the discovery that awaits her is something she couldn't have foreseen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pervade Montego Bay &lt;/em&gt;is book two in the romance duet by USA Today Bestselling Author Vanessa Fewings, the follow-up to the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Pervade London&lt;/em&gt;. Experience a ménage à trois romance that unfolds from clear, warm waters to lush, rolling mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sip the rum. Taste the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ecstasy&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; See you in &lt;strong&gt;paradise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love In Santa Lena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire series in one place!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FALLING FOR JACK&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your heart has been broken, the last thing you should do is fall into another man's arms, let alone his bed. Yet that's exactly what I did. And then I ran like a thief in the night. If I never see Jack again, it will be too soon. But I guess fate has a sense of humor, because the sexy chef who saw me at my worst is my new client.&lt;br /&gt; ***&lt;br /&gt;The beautiful creature stumbled into my life and fled just as quickly. Harper's disappearance left me confused and frustrated. But when she appears, flustered and gorgeous in my morning meeting, I can't resist the chance to see if I can rekindle the spark we had. Another relationship is the last thing I need, but I can't resist the flame Harper ignites inside me. No one said love was easy, but why does it have to be so damn hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONVINCING HARPER&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes love means walking away...and that's exactly what I did.&lt;br /&gt;I swore off men and then I met Jack. Consumed with desire, I fell hard and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he would be different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out he was keeping a secret... a big one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping I was wrong about love, but he just proved me right.&lt;br /&gt;And he's going to have a heck of a time convincing me otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WAITING ON JASON&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been waiting for the right man to come along my whole life...Screw that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m done desperately watching my biological clock tick down, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the hands of a turkey baster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Jason drove into my life and my resolve nearly crumbled. One night is all I can give him. It’s all he wants. At least, that’s what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of assuming he wasn’t a forever kind of guy. Turns out Jason just might be the one I’ve been waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEALED BY CHELSEA&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I’d fall for an older man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s smart. Sexy. Irresistible. Everything I’ve ever wanted, but I can't have him. He’s broken. Guarded. He'll never give me what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I still want him? Because I am going to show him how to live again... and how to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that was the plan.</description>

  <description>Aiden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you asked me last month if I had a fulfilling life being single, I would have said yes. But all of that changed when I met Stella. After a drink in my restaurant bar, we shared an incredible night together. The only problem was, she was gone when I woke up the next morning. No note, no phone number, nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a month later, I still can’t get her out of my mind. Somehow, she did a number on me, turning me into such a ball of self-pity, I can't even work up the desire to move on. With no way of contacting her, I’m more than a little shocked to find her waiting in front of my door one evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my wildest hopes, she isn’t here for a repeat of our passionate night. The nature of her visit is completely unexpected, ending with a surprise that’s about to turn both of our lives upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One I’m not sure I’m ready for.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Best Kind Of Surprise is book two in The Best Kind Novella series by Jasmin Miller. This is a quick read and I fell in love with it.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;val·or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;great bravery in the face of danger, especially in battle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, Jackson Richards had it in spades. As a member of the United States Special Forces, he fought alongside the bravest and most capable men he’d ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one mistake landed them all in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six months, he fought. But one terrible day, his captors learned the full extent of his skills, and that sealed his fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortured and broken for endless months in conditions that made Hell look like a five-star resort, Jackson Richards died, and Isaad was born. Shaped into a weapon for the wrong side, he’d forgotten who he once was. Who he was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the days his captor imprisoned Joey Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping Joey and her marine escape reminded Jackson of the man he used to be. And now, he’ll fight. For himself. For the friends he thought he lost in Hell. And for Caro. The woman with a secret he can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he’s strong enough, he’ll leave Isaad behind. Maybe then, he can take back his true name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Ripper.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;WARNING: This book contains scenes of torture and implied sexual violence that may be disturbing to sensitive readers.&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;Patton Fletcher is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔Demanding,&lt;br /&gt;✔Driven,&lt;br /&gt;✔Sexy AF, and&lt;br /&gt;✔My New Boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister says don’t fall for him. I say don’t worry.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not about to let some arrogant, young CEO derail my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;Or insult my wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t care about his deep brown eyes or the way the muscle moves in his square jaw when he’s pissed.&lt;br /&gt;I won’t fall for his power or how sexy he fills out that suit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I said I could resist him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I was wrong…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s stubborn, independent, and a fighter.&lt;br /&gt;She has long, dark hair, crystal blue eyes, and freckles…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Freckles.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And long, sexy legs.&lt;br /&gt;And a smart mouth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent seven years building one of the top companies in Nashville, and I’m not about to let some ambitious, cardigan-wearing new kid distract me from my goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raquel Morgan won’t tempt me.&lt;br /&gt;I’m The Boss, and &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I never lose control…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(BOSS OF ME is a STAND-ALONE workplace, enemies to lovers, military romance with a badass alpha boss and the feisty woman who steals his heart. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>At twelve years old, I was torn from my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fourteen I met her: my reason to draw breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One look into Everly Williams's big brown eyes and I knew I’d do anything to protect her. And for eight years I did. She was my world. My best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But afraid I'd lose her, I held on too tight. Became a dark cloud blocking her sun. So I did what I needed to, and walked away. I hurt us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m home, and need Everly back in my life. Only everything is different. We’re different. My body burns for her when she’s near. And after one explosive kiss, I know she feels it too. I’ll do whatever it takes to earn her trust again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don’t want what we had before. I want it all...for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best friend's to lovers romance in the sexy new &lt;i&gt;Rocktown Ink&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's a rebel with a heart of gold.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Black is a rebel and always has been. His dark past has left him scarred, but under his hot, bad-boy exterior is a shining heart of gold. When a cute, sassy chef who looks like an angel serves Max a slice of her warm apple pie, he notices an unmistakable bruise around her left eye and knows exactly what caused it. Can Max handle this new obsession and control his lust long enough to save her without destroying her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peach Sutton spends every waking moment cooking, baking and working to make her new restaurant among the best in Los Angeles. But when one of her customers turns into a stalker, she runs—literally—straight into the arms of the gorgeous blue-eyed stranger who could be either the devil or a saint. Is Max Black just as dangerous as the man Peach is running from? Or is he the white knight lover she never expected to find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Max is a spin-off from the I Love You series and is a sexy standalone story.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book 2 in the I Love You series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lexi and Rafe's connection began with an intense lust and a white-hot obsession. Then it deepened into an all-encompassing love affair that awes them both. But when Rafe’s jealousy reaches fever-pitch, it only drives Lexi away … and literally into the arms of Rafe’s rebel brother, Max. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Rafe find her? Will Max cross a line? And can Lexi forgive Rafe for loving her too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their tangled web only gets more complicated as Lexi returns to Downtown to begin her new job. Rafe has to somehow figure out how to balance his love with his overprotective urges. But will an ex from Rafe’s past and a colleague who has his sights set on the CEO’s gorgeous new assistant be enough to drive them apart again? Or are Rafe and Lexi destined to be together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find out in XOXX I Love You More, the exciting conclusion to the I Love You series (includes an epilogue!).&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young graduate. A ruthless CEO. And an attraction neither of them was prepared for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After graduating from college, Lexi Blondeau moves to L.A. By some miracle, she gets an interview for a dream job, at Downtown, the “It” company of the decade. If rumors are anything to go by, CEO Rafe Black is not only one of the most ruthless men in the city, but also one of the hottest men on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the interview, the last thing Lexi is expecting is for the mysterious—and unbelievably sexy—Rafe Black to literally sweep her off her feet. To say their chemistry is off the charts would be an understatement. Within days, Lexi’s life seems to have transformed itself in every possible way, and all because of her new boss, who also happens to be her passionate new lover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rafe takes Lexi to his private estate in Kauai so he can keep her all to himself. But will Rafe’s obsession become too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;XOXO I Love You is the first book in the I Love You series. If you like fun, sexy romance starring obsessed alphas, you’ll love Julie Capulet’s page-turning book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note: this is the first book of a two-book series and ends in a cliffhanger. The second book in the series, XOXX I Love You More, is now available.</description>

  <description>Tammy Reed thought she was through with her a**hole ex.  But when he brings trouble knocking at her door, she doesn't call her brother, mega movie star Nathan Reed.  She calls his friend Jake Carter, the sexy PI who'd fixed her troubles once before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only things are a bit different this time.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And in between a bar brawl, surveillance snacks, and a little drive-thru flirting, Jake has no trouble showing Tammy exactly how different they are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a former navy SEAL, Jake specializes in securing the odds, and the stakes for him have never been higher. He's done waiting for Tammy. It's time for him to lay claim to what's his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And failure is not an option. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novella is part of the Gamblers series but can be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Due to sex and language, it is recommended for persons over 18. **HEA**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dear Jerk Across the Street, sorry for accidentally walking in on you and catching an eyeful of your—equipment. And hard pass on the open invitation to join you in the shower “anytime”, A-hole.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s the note I should’ve written. Instead I sent a pleasant and apologetic version. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Had I known Phoenix “Nix” Russo would’ve been the neighbor from hell, I’d have told him right where he could shove my words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nix is the big man on campus with everyone lined up at his games to make sure he knows it. Sure, he’s got piercing blue eyes, abs that don’t quit and a smile that could set fire to a set of panties from a hundred yards away, but he’s also the biggest pain in my ass.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Pink-Haired Menace, learn how to take a joke and stop being such a kill-joy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Masterson called the cops on one of my parties—again. My sweet talking usually gets me out of trouble, but this time it got me into a nice pair of silver handcuffs. Now I’m on a reputation rehab tour with a stop at a spring break community service project. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Guess who’s my new boss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now we’re shoulder to shoulder, sweaty, tired and…she’s not anything like I expected. There might just be a heart under that hardass exterior. She’s invading my dreams and I can’t shake the feeling she’s the key to unlocking a piece of me that I’ve hidden away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s only a matter of time until she finds out why I’m really here.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can break through her walls and into her heart before that happens...one screw at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;i&gt;The Second We Met&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; new adult romance**</description>

  <description>I'm Starr Elizabeth Connor. Earth's government falsely convicted me of a crime, packed me on a ship with other female felons, and sent us to Dakon, a primitive, frozen wasteland of a planet. Why? Earth needs minerals, and Dakon is desperate for females.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I'm no barbarian’s 'mail order bride,' even if he is super tall, muscular, and the chief of his tribe. He doesn’t want a BBW blonde, either--it's written all over his chiseled face. He'll be truly angry if he ever learns what my 'crime' was.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am Torg. I have waited 34 rotations for a mate of my own. With this shipment, I was sure to get a fine, sturdy mate who'll bear me many daughters. Instead, I receive a small, curvy, pale-haired female who looks at me with anger and fear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is only when we 'kiss' that I believe things may work out between us. But I'm hearing rumors that Starr and her shipmates are law-breakers. To survive, Dakonians must obey all laws … or be exiled into the frozen wasteland. Just when I have found her, will I have to send my mate to die?</description>

  <description>Melanie Moreland - The Summer of Us&lt;br /&gt;She was the light in my dark life. The sunshine that warmed me and made me smile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had one summer. One perfect summer, until the day it ended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, she walked back into my life. Older. Sadder. More beautiful than ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I prove to her that summer was real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I make her see that boy that loved her then, still loves her now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we get back to the summer when we were us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Briggs - The Inheritance&lt;br /&gt;A Port Henry Novella&lt;br /&gt;Riley Maxwell spends her days working from her New York City apartment, designing websites and copywriting for clients around the world. Most of her exposure to people outside of her home base is her visits to the local Chinese takeout place down the street. Satisfied with her life of solitude, Riley’s summer gets turned upside-down when a wealthy client passes away, leaving her a beach house in Port Henry, New York, one of the wealthiest shore towns on the East Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Great Dane, Scrappy, who—surprise!—she also inherited, gets sick, she takes him to the nearest veterinarian, where she meets Donovan Hunter. A ridiculously good-looking playboy, Donovan immediately gets under Riley’s skin, and she can’t wait to be rid of the house, the dog, and Port Henry. Dr. Hunter, on the other hand, can’t get enough of Riley’s sass and how different she is from the usual summer crowd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer passes and Dr. Hunter runs out of made-up reasons to get Riley and Scrappy back into the office, he cooks up a new plan to catch her attention, setting a plan in motion to get the girl, and the dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caisey Quinn - Summer Seduction &lt;br /&gt;Emersyn Tyler is having one rough summer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her mom’s violent temper and recent diagnosis send her dad packing, she’s left to take care of her little brother alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget basking in the sunshine, she’s busy working full-time and taking summer classes at the local college so she can graduate high school. Until her friend drags her to a carnival where she runs smack into him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue-eyed Adonis from her art history class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden Singleton isn’t looking for anything more than a meaningless hook-up. Finishing his graduate degree so that he can teach history and coach hockey in the fall, he’s got plenty on his plate without any added complications. But when a blond-haired beauty needs his help, all he can say is yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden knows he and Emersyn share something special. What he doesn’t know is that they also share a secret, one that could fracture both of their futures forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi McLaughlin - By The Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Danny Weatherly never had planned to take over his dad’s practice but when everything changedafter one awful day, the summer before college, he really didn’t think about much of anything at all — because his life was over. His true love hated him. . . and for good reason.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kelly Taft is moving back to her hometown, Gray, North Carolina. Back to her family, back to her friends — back to some good memories and back to some memories that were not so good. In fact, she’s never gotten over that one horrible day that sent her running in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danielle Pearl - Love’s a Beach&lt;br /&gt;Summer Souls Series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liza Farrell is a townie and she has no qualms about it. It’s her quasi-boyfriend who has issues with the “summer people” and at this point she wishes he wasn’t her boyfriend at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With college looming just a couple of months away, she couldn’t be more eager to begin the next stage of her life. That is, until Noah Reed returns to town, shaking up both her present, and her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absent for the past couple of years, Noah has grown into pure perfection. All man now, just his presence makes it clear that Liza’s current situation simply isn’t what she wants. When Liza and Noah reconnect, they have more between them than either could have predicted, but when their pasts rear up in a frightening, violent crash, will they find a future together, or just accept that love is a… beach?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katy Regnery - Single in Sitka&lt;br /&gt;A single Dad. A personal ad. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Seattle journalist, Amanda McKendrick, pitches a new story about the increase of bear attacks in Sitka, her newspaper sends her north for two weeks. While there, she answers the personal ad of single dad, Luke Kingston, looking for a little no-strings-attached fun to pass the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the sweet, widowered father of three—who just happens to be a smokin’ hot state trooper—turns out to be a lot more than Amanda bargained for. As the days go by, she wonders if it’ll be possible to return to Seattle without leaving her heart behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shari J. Ryan - The Secret at Sunset&lt;br /&gt;When a girls’ weekend getaway turns into more than Alexa Cale bargained for, she sets off alone on a sunset stroll, seeking a small cove nestled in the ocean’s inlet of Cabos San Lucas. No one warned Alexa that the high tide will swallow the hiking path. Stranded on rocks between the beach and ocean, Alexa finds herself thankful for Lincoln Holt, an attractive survivalist who purposely loses track of the tide’s time.</description>

  <description>Full house: a pair plus a three of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having grown up surrounded by celebrities, Victoria Lee wasn't one to have her head turned by a famous movie star. That changed when she landed her first big break starring alongside Hollywood’s most sought-after leading man, Nathan Reed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his sexy good looks, take-charge personality, and hidden charm, Victoria hadn’t stood a chance. And all too soon, their on-screen romance turned into a real-life love story—juicy enough to have social media exploding and land Victoria and Nate on the covers of tabloid magazines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the media outlets weren’t the only ones paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;And not everyone was happy for them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note: &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, steamy, contemporary romance novel without a cliffhanger. It is part of a series, but each book is a stand-alone centering on new main characters. Due to sex, language, and violence it is recommended for persons over 18.*** HEA ***</description>

  <description>His entire life, he was trained to do one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill vampires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he had to make an impossible choice and run from the very people he used to call family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In St. John's, he found a place he could settle down. A place the Hunters would never find him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his haven turns out to be anything but safe when a beautiful shield maiden walks into the pub where he's slinging drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, evil threatens the entire world and the local coven likes to interfere—with everyone and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's really too bad that shield maiden is a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or…is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you willing to taste immortality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come with us and let our vampires glamour you into a world full of dangerous magic, toe-curling heat, and a love to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vampire Mates series by the Midnight Coven contains thirteen tales penned by your favorite best-selling paranormal romance authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each novella can be read as a complete standalone, but of course, we hope you’ll bite into them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With our Vampire Mates at your side, immortality is sexy AF.</description>

  <description>A tyrant by day, a playboy by night. That is the reputation that precedes Richard VanRyan. He lives life the way he wants, no concern for the opinion of others. He cares for no one, is completely unrepentant, and he has no desire to change his ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katharine Elliott works under Richard as his PA. She despises him and his questionable ethics, but endures all the garbage he sends her way, because she needs the job. Her end goal is far more important than the daily abuse and demands she tolerates from her nasty tyrant of a boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day, he asks her for something she never expected. A new role with a personal contract — fiancée instead of PA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when two people who loathe each other, have to live together and act as though they are madly in love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the power of love really change a person?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they survive the contract?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when the one person you hate the most becomes the one person you can’t live without?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some fantasies are better left unsaid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, I don’t need to act on my dirty dreams, not when my fiancé and I have the kind of after dark adventures others dream of — wild, daring and oh so frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t risk losing him by voicing my deepest, dirtiest desire. But the hotter our role playing gets, the closer I come to telling him what I want most — him and his best friend at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Until the night I do…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Engagement Gift is a standalone 20,000 word MFM novella with an HEA and NO cheating! Be prepared for a red-hot story that'll heat you up and make you toss off your panties!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[The Engagement Gift is a stand alone novella by Lauren Blakely. This is only my second book by Ms. Blakely but I think I’m safe in saying that this book is much steamier than is her norm.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“These kisses of his...they're demanding and possessive. They're hungry and deep. They're the kisses of a man who wants more of a woman—who wants &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;—and isn't going to stop until he gets it."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author Olivia Rossi hasn’t been able to write a word since tragedy struck two years ago and ripped her world apart. Heartbroken and still haunted by the past, she accepts an offer to spend the summer at a friend’s apartment in Paris in search of healing and her lost muse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she finds instead is James, an enigmatic stranger who ignites in her an unexpected and all-consuming passion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to tell each other nothing more than their first names, Olivia and James embark on a torrid affair. But the more time they spend together, the more Olivia begins to realize her summer fling is turning into a powerful connection…and that the magnetic man she’s falling in love with might not be what he seems at all.</description>

  <description>Alaska can be a bleak and dangerous place, especially in the dead of winter. But when hair-raising whispers about an outbreak reach the small harbor town of Whitely, the townspeople face a new, unfathomable fear— the virus is coming for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie thought life was complicated when she had teen pregnancy and her squeaky-clean reputation as the mayor’s daughter to worry about. But strict schedules and perfectly groomed hair become yesterday’s concerns as bloodcurdling screams pierce the night air and lurid memories haunt feverish dreams. Weak and alone, Sophie must survive the longest, most terrifying night of her life and pray she won’t be the only one left when she wakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex is the kid from the wrong side of the tracks and trouble seems to follow him wherever he goes. It’s all he can do to keep his head down until his eighteenth birthday when he can leave his life in foster care behind him. But Alex doesn’t realize he and the quiet girl from class with lonely, blue eyes are fated in the most impossible way imaginable. Death is everywhere, and even in the gray dawn of morning, after the fever subsides and the world echoes in silence, Alex will have to face his darkest fear yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Longest Night is a prequel novella in the Savage North Chronicles, part of the bestselling, post-apocalyptic Ending World. You do not have to read The Ending Series in order to enjoy the Savage North Chronicles.</description>

  <description>Thirteen... &lt;br /&gt;Unlucky for some. &lt;br /&gt;Including me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman I loved left me on the thirteenth. &lt;br /&gt;Thirteen months of living together and she walked out the door without looking back, straight into another man's arms. &lt;br /&gt;She was kind enough to leave something to remind me of her: thirteen thousand pounds worth of debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen; the day I lost my nuts. &lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn't lose them, cancer took them from me. Better to be a man without balls than one without life.&lt;br /&gt;Still, thirteen sucked... until it didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until her.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen might just be my new lucky number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thirteen is book #4 in the 'Love by Numbers' series. It is interconnected but can be read as a standalone.*</description>

It will last the longest, cut the deepest and feel the strongest. &lt;br /&gt;It is an imperfect love; a disfigured circle that never ends. &lt;br /&gt;You cannot control it; it's as simple as blinking and just like blinking the more you try to stop it, the more the pain consumes you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is book 3 in 'The Love by Numbers' series. &lt;br /&gt;Although it contains characters from the previous books, it can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes the STEAMY Part Two and conclusion of &lt;i&gt;The Boyfriend Collector&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Dr. Bex Hughes, and I’m in love with a woman who cannot truly love me back. Unless I help her as my patient, and that is forbidden—a taboo in the eyes of the world and the worst professional sin for a therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what else can I do? Rose was once a real-life Cinderella. Now she’s wealthy, single, and free. Except she’s convinced that love is used to hurt people, family tries to murder you for money, and no one can be trusted. It’s all she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I’m bending every rule I’ve ever lived by and helping her find her way to real happiness. Only, my self-control wears thin as I hear the details of Rose’s dating adventures. Can I prove I will love her unconditionally before my jealousy shatters her trust in me forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Part 2 of 2)</description>

  <description>I'm sorry for your loss. &lt;br /&gt;Why do people say that? &lt;br /&gt;When someone you love is taken from you, when a part of you dies along with them, you haven't lost them like you would your car keys or mobile phone. They aren't stuck down the side of the sofa or left in the ignition of your car for you to find later. You haven't absentmindedly put them somewhere and forgotten. You will never lose them because they live in you. &lt;br /&gt;The soul crushing hurt that burns your lungs with every breath you take comes from knowing where they are and not being with them. &lt;br /&gt;The ugly and real definition of grief is being left behind. &lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry they left you. &lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry you are alone. &lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry it hurts to breathe. &lt;br /&gt;Loss; it doesn't even compare.&lt;br /&gt;She was my first love. &lt;br /&gt;She is my last love. &lt;br /&gt;I am an empty husk who pretends to be filled with enough love for those of us she left behind. &lt;br /&gt;Our little girl and newborn son need me. &lt;br /&gt;I am both mother and father now. &lt;br /&gt;I am hollow and empty. &lt;br /&gt;I am a shell. &lt;br /&gt;So why does the girl with the face of an angel and eyes that mirror my emptiness, look at me like I'm her everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Book #6 in the 'Love by Numbers' series. Can be read as a standalone.*</description>

  <description>One click. &lt;br /&gt;One perfect frame. &lt;br /&gt;That's all it takes to capture an eternal moment; although most people let them pass by without acknowledgement. &lt;br /&gt;I don't waste any. &lt;br /&gt;Not a single one. &lt;br /&gt;If I see something of beauty, I want to experience it, feel it and immortalise it. &lt;br /&gt;If I see someone of beauty, I want to taste them, worship them and memorise them. &lt;br /&gt;I don't have a type, if I like you, I like you. &lt;br /&gt;I don't have a preference. &lt;br /&gt;My bisexuality is a gift, not a defect. &lt;br /&gt;It's the freedom to see beyond gender. &lt;br /&gt;One blink. &lt;br /&gt;One touch. &lt;br /&gt;One night. &lt;br /&gt;Life is filled with so many ones. &lt;br /&gt;One chance to get things right. &lt;br /&gt;One life to live as you choose. &lt;br /&gt;One decision that gives you acceptance. &lt;br /&gt;One person to fill the emptiness. &lt;br /&gt;Just one? &lt;br /&gt;Nah, like I said, life is full of ones. &lt;br /&gt;My camera lets me focus on the good times; I develop from life's negatives, and if things don't work out, I just take another shot. &lt;br /&gt;Who needs just one? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book #5 in the 'Love by Numbers' series. &lt;br /&gt;Can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nothing But a Dare is a second chance, enemies to lovers rom-com with a 	curvy, will punch you in the throat heroine, and a hero that will push every button she has for fun. Oh, and did I mention there's a cat that wears turtleneck sweaters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After what could possibly be the world's worst morning, the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing Abbie expected to see as she walked into her meeting was her childhood nemesis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter. Freaking. James. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of world's worst morning now seemed like an understatement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abbie walked into the conference room looking like a complete mess, 	and still killed her presentation, Hunter knew he'd made the right decision 	signing on with WCM Advertising. He was there for one reason, and one reason only. Abbie was going to be his, even if he had to dare her every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game on.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A sweet, flirty, and heartfelt romance with two roommates that spend one enthralling summer together.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her car accident, Monica believes her dance career is over, despite the positive outlook everyone else has. Instead of trying to get back on her feet, she works on perfecting the art of couch surfing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous author, Gabe Mitchell, doesn’t fare much better. On top of watching his roommate letting her life pass by, he also suffers from a major bout of writer’s block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping a change of scenery will get them both out of their rut, Gabe takes matters into his own hands and whisks Monica away to his own personal haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What neither one of them expects is the attraction to each other to bloom even though Monica will leave Brooksville in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their time together is filled with skimpy bathing suits, sexy fantasy book inspirations, hot tub make-out sessions, and new job prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s plenty to reignite their creative flames, but will it be enough to turn their one short summer into something more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;***This is book two in the Brooksville series and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed! (Book one is Baking With A Rockstar and features Gabe’s brother Hudson.)***&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Her blood is unlike any other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Riley Scott is dying. Heavy metal poisoning is slowly killing her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan Bonney was turned more than three hundred years ago. He hates killing, so he allows groups to tour his castle—where he can take his pick of the unsuspecting for a quick snack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he sees Riley for the first time, he must taste her. Her blood is intoxicating, but it is her ability to resist his glamour that makes her truly beguiling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan isn't the only vampire hunting her, and when Riley's taken, he will do anything to find her—and save her. Battling Hunters and enemy vampires is nothing new for Declan, but this time, he cannot fail. If he loses Riley, his very existence is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever Kept is a novella featured in the Vampire Brides series. All books in the Vampire Brides series are standalone paranormal romances and can be read in any order.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was the bad boy I fell for in college. Now he’s a sexy single dad and Charleston’s most successful venture capitalist. Dominant and decisive, Ford Montgomery is used to getting what he wants. And he just set his sights on me...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford Montgomery was my first everything.&lt;br /&gt;First love. &lt;br /&gt;First guy I slept with.&lt;br /&gt;First heartbreak when he dumped me without explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade later, it’s just my luck he’s the first guy I run into after moving back to my hometown of Charleston. Three piece suit, tie, and a watch worth more than my car—being a mogul looks good on Ford. So does being a doting dad to his adorable four-year-old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I can resist him. But one impulsive, ill-advised kiss later, and Ford is in hot pursuit. He’s determined to make up for his past mistakes, and convinces me to give him a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started out as fun between the sheets gets really serious, really fast. Problem is, I swore I’d never give up the dreams I worked so hard for to settle down and do the family thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seeing Ford light up around his daughter—seeing how he’s chasing his ambitions while rocking fatherhood—is making me rethink what I want out of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t help that behind his corporate veneer is the bad boy I fell in love with. And bad boys aren’t afraid to play dirty...or break hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUTHERN HEARTBREAKER is a full-length, STANDALONE romance releasing October 24, 2019. It is part of the Charleston Heat Series, which is a series of interconnected standalone novels set in the steamy southern town of Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOUTHERN CHARMER: Oliva and Eli’s book&lt;br /&gt;SOUTHERN PLAYER: Gracie and Luke’s book&lt;br /&gt;SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN: Julia and Greyson’s book&lt;br /&gt;SOUTHERN HEARTBREAKER: Eva and Ford’s book &lt;/b&gt;</description>

And I want my older brother’s best friend to step up to the plate...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dating history is lame. My experiences in bed? Even lamer.

My brother’s best friend. Former Major League baseball player. A guy who now hangs out on his farm, sweaty and shirtless, as he nurses a shoulder injury.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the rumors are true, he also likes to work up a sweat behind closed doors. A total MVP in the sack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the take charge guy I’m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Luke and I, it’s game on. And it’s all good until Luke decides he wants forever, and he wants it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m just not convinced I can trust Luke. Will he keep playing the field? Or is he really ready to hang up his cleats for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUTHERN PLAYER is a full-length, STANDALONE romance that will release on February 28, 2019!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I know two things when I meet my new boss, Greyson Parker Montgomery III. &lt;br /&gt;One, he’s an egomaniac. And two, we’re going to get naked. &lt;br /&gt;Something I didn’t know? That I’d end up pregnant.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one is more surprised by our off-the-charts chemistry than me. I’m a free spirit with a passion for design and a taste for the bohemian. Greyson is a cocky venture capitalist who’s as pretentious as his sharply cut power suits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He owns half of Charleston, and has the other half at his beck and call. But the only place he owns me is in bed...or in the backseat of his car, boneless and begging for mercy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We argue over contracts and costs all day long. Behind closed doors, however, we engage in a different kind of business. The kind that has me surrendering to his unique brand of dominance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our no-strings attached arrangement suits me just fine. Until I wake up one morning with what I think is a wicked hangover. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only it’s not a hangover.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought Greyson was a typical “greed is good” grump. But when he demands to be involved in the life we accidentally created, I start to see a different side of him. One that’s more gentleman than jerk.Am I crazy to think we could be a family together? Or is making me fall for him just another one of his power plays? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN is a STANDALONE, full length, accidental pregnancy/enemies-to-lovers romance.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A billionaire. His assistant. And a game that could cost both their hearts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aidan Winters. Gorgeous, brilliant, ruthless, and filthy rich. He’s known as the Man in Black, because New York’s most sought-after bachelor is icy perfection in an all-black suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his executive assistant, I know his suit size, the security code to his penthouse, and the number to his private line. The only thing I don’t know is what would make him fall to his knees for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, one night, I discover Aidan’s sexy secret. And he discovers mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we play a very dirty game. By day, we’re all business. But by night… he’s not Aidan and I’m not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No emotions. No lies. Except for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think this is a story about a girl who hates her boss, think again.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five year old Alyssa Moretti dreams of finding her forever love. But, as a single mother and business owner, she doesn't have time for casual relationships. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-four year old Ian Rhodes is a very successful entrepreneur and a definite ladies man. He has no intention of settling down any time soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until Ian meets Alyssa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian cannot deny his instant attraction to Alyssa, but she immediately identifies him as a player and isn't interested in becoming his next conquest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Brooke Miller, Ian's most recent scorned lover, isn't going without a fight. She'll seemingly stop at nothing to get Ian back into her life, and her bed, where she feels he belongs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Ian change his ways and become the man Alyssa needs and will they find a happily ever after together despite Brooke's meddling?</description>

  <description>A surprise daughter, an unlikely attraction, and a Christmas wish…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dax Stockton is finally content with his life, especially since his new position as manager of an animal rescue is so blessedly free of human drama…. until pretty southern belle Taren Blanton brings drama of a totally different sort to his orderly world. Taren is from a wealthy and powerful political family. A woman far out of his league. He is military trained, so he can just discipline her right out of his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taren has no idea why the grouchy former SEAL growls at her whenever she tries to talk to him. Even more surprising is why he fascinates her so. Because no matter how gentle he is with the animals, he’s just not her type. Not even close. When Dax learns he has a daughter, he seems so lost, and Taren’s heart goes out to him. A daughter is a precious gift, and no one knows that better than her. The loss of her own beloved baby broke her, but just maybe this gruff man with the gentle hands and his daughter can heal her. And in return, maybe she can show Dax and his little girl how to be a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can one little girl’s wish and the magic of Christmas bring together two wounded souls, giving her the family she desperately wants?</description>

  <description>Starlight Harbor’s Sweetheart has had enough…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyra Grigor is the easy going, sweet, smile-at-everyone owner of The Sweetest Things.  When an annoying travel site puts Starlight Harbor on their Top Ten Tacky Tiny Towns list for the fourth year running, she knows it’s time to give the writer a bit of spicy tart instead of a teaspoon of sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An outsider who just wants out…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spence Côte﻿ has no idea what hit his site. Nearly a thousand replies on some little baker’s comment and everything has blown up. Since the site is up for sale, it couldn’t have happened at a worse time. Now he has to drive up to the middle of nowhere coast of Maine and get this resolved. ASAP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two worlds collide…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the puppies dressed as pirates, the older women masquerading as tavern wenches, and the sweetest little baker he’s ever seen, Spence knows Starlight Harbor might not just be freakishly adorable….it might be what he’d been looking for.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; and Amazon #1 Bestselling author Terri Osburn comes a new installment in the Shooting Stars series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Veronica Shepherd thought she was fine. She thought she was over her ex-husband. But now said ex-husband is marrying his high school sweetheart–the only woman he’s ever really loved–and Veronica is not taking the news well. In fact, she’s spending Christmas Eve drinking herself into oblivion, and into the arms of one sexy bartender. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on his childhood alone, Cameron Rhodes should either be in prison, in rehab, or six feet under. Instead, he’s spent the last twenty years building a life that no one could have predicted. Now, to his own disgust, he’s been named one of Nashville’s most eligible bachelors—mostly because he’s one of the wealthiest men in town. A rich mortal among the stars. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cam’s life is turned upside down when a beautiful woman passes out in his arms. With nothing but a dead cell phone and a useless coat check ticket to go on, his only option is to take her home and let her sleep it off in the safety of his apartment. What follows is an adventure he never saw coming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before the ball drops on New Year’s Eve, Veronica and Cam will pretend to be lovers, become real lovers, and consider the possibility of becoming so much more.</description>

  <description>My best friend's sister is back in town, and while she’s here, she's under my protection. Quinn Parker had her heart broken, and I'll make sure no one hurts her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she starts looking around for a hot, no-strings distraction, I can’t stand back and do nothing. No one is touching this vibrant beauty...but me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the woman of my dreams, but Quinn wants a good time, not a long time. We play by her rules: no one finds out, no one gets hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to keep it casual because an ex-con like me can't offer her forever…even if I want so much more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Failing wasn't an option, but apparently falling for my professor was.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attending the prestigious King University is one of the many things I must do to keep my parents happy and my trust fund secure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having a stellar transcript is another. Unfortunately, my grades are slipping and the only available option is setting up extra help with my professor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the first study session I know I’m in trouble. Her tempting lips and the honey scent of her perfume tests my resolve until it crumbles. One shared kiss and I’m willing to risk it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professor Martínez may be my downfall, but falling never felt so good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Attending King University was at the top of my bucket list. Falling in love with my professor wasn’t.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Earning a full scholarship to King University was my hard earned ticket out of hell. I'm happy to be away from the small town I grew up in and all the equally small minded people who live there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King was going to be my safe haven. A place where I could leave the old me behind and finally grow into the young man my family had desperately tried to hide away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diving head first into new experiences, new friends, and parties, I didn’t expect to run straight into the one thing I wasn’t ready for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His arms are welcoming, his body is addictive and his lips are heaven. Cole Huxley is everything I could fall in love with, except for one problem... I never wanted to fall for my professor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Devilry is part of the King University Series, but can be read as a complete standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Melanie: I can’t even believe I didn’t make eye contact with the guy on the elevator. I’d seen him before in my office building and he was totally awesome to look at. From what I could tell by the way his suit clung to him, he had a hot bod, too. Another missed opportunity! I’m so lame. Next time, I’ll see if he wants to do lunch. I wonder if he listens to 80s music when he works out, because he has got to work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyler: Dude, that chick in the elevator was mad fine. My sister may think I’m not capable of keeping a relationship, but she’s bugg’n. I’m gonna show the girl with the big green eyes that I’m all that and a bag of chips. Next time I see her, I’m gonna hit her up for sure. I wonder how she feels about watching 90s TV reruns on Friday nights? TGIF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie and Tyler may be decades apart, but working for the same publishing company brings the irresistible pair together. The ambitious duo is filled with dreams that don’t include being executive assistants for the rest of their lives. Somewhere between the laughter and arguing over which decade brought the better entertainment and fads, they fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tension mounts as the pressure and excitement of new opportunities increases and their dreams get closer to becoming a reality…but what happens when one of their dreams doesn’t come true?</description>

  <description>When love turns to hate—that’s where I come in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Halton Andrew Smithers, attorney. Hal to my clients and friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Messy divorces, deadbeat dads, runaway wives, cheating partners—I handle them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the seedy side of love, and it isn’t pretty. I avoid emotional attachments—I’ve seen all too often when hot passion turns to frozen tundra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I satisfy myself with helping people behind the scenes. It gives me a sense of satisfaction that completes my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she enters it and everything I believe is turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She fills a void I never knew existed, and I know without her, my life will never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, I want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But am I strong enough?</description>

  <description>Crystal Cove's small town charm is what most people love about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brady Lowe sure loves it. He is about as small town as you get. Brady’s content running his dad's construction company, eating at the diner every Thursday, and taking home a local lady from his sister's bar when he has an itch to scratch. Brady scratches that itch just fine, until Glory Falcone blows into town. Glory is mouthy, smart, and hotter than June in Crystal Cove and Brady knows she's the one he's been waiting for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Glory gets as far as her jeep will take her; it just so happens to be cute, idyllic Crystal Cove. It also just so happens to have Brady Lowe as it's welcoming committee. Glory doesn't exactly believe in happily ever afters, not after the "after's" she's had. At least she didn't. Not until Brady Lowe's determined ways, crooked smile and home town charm make her want for more.</description>

  <description>Ten years. Ten endless years I've waited to destroy the man who tore my family apart. But I never thought I'd get the chance... until his daughter walked into my tattoo parlour, looked me in the eye — and had no damned clue who I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never planned on falling for Cassandra Deighton. She's silk scarves and manicures. I'm scars and rage. Yet I can't resist when she begs for more, my ice queen who burns with enough heat to sear the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to end this. Before she finds out who I am. Before she gets hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm not the only one with secrets. We both have our scars, and if the truth comes out, we could lose everything...</description>

  <description>Olive has always been content living an anti-social existence while letting the character’s she writes about fulfill her wild side. She’s worked hard to achieve a zero human interaction life. However, that came to an end when out of nowhere her best friend announced she’s moving out, and her brother was moving in. Not only does Olive now have to deal with the guy that has teased her their whole life, but he also came with a cat the size of a human child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank’s had a thing for Olive for as long as he could remember. When he realized she needed a roommate, he jumped at the chance. Why wouldn’t he when annoying Olive had always been his favorite pastime? Then, one day when Hank let his curiosity get the better of him, he discovered Olive had a whole other side of her she kept hidden away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all Hank had to do was convince Olive life was a heck of a lot more fun when you add some fire to it. Honestly, what could possibly go wrong?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book one of NOLA Knights, the heart-stoppingly sexy spinoff series by Men of Haven author Rhenna Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;His world. His rules. Her love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though his methods may be rough, when it comes to protecting what’s his, Russian vor Sergei Petrovyh’s heart is always in the right place. That’s never been more true than when the gorgeous Evette Labadie asks him for a job. He knows enough to keep his hands off someone as beloved by the locals as Evie, but there’s something about her that calls to him—no matter how badly he burns to make her his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t think Evie hasn’t noticed the powerful Russian mafia boss who makes her favorite diner a regular stop. How can she not? He’s as hot as his reputation is dangerous. But everyone in her struggling New Orleans neighborhood knows he’s the man to turn to. And right now she needs money to get her son out of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her other needs—needs she knows damn well Sergei can more than satisfy—will have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie soon finds herself playing Cinderella to a man who, despite what people believe, is definitely more prince than villain. She can’t help falling deeper in love with each passing day. But when a turf war between Sergei and a rival brings violence to her doorstep, Evie must come to grips with loving a man who will do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to defend her…or walk away from her best chance at a happily-ever-after of her very own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 88,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Being arranged to marry a Highlander lord is hardly uncommon.&lt;br /&gt;But when he happens to be gorgeous, powerful, dominant, and your best friend’s &lt;i&gt;dad?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, &lt;i&gt;that’s&lt;/i&gt; another story…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lachlan McDougall is a lot of things: powerful, ruggedly handsome Highlander Lord, fierce ex-warrior, my soon-to-be-husband…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…And my best friend’s &lt;i&gt;dad&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in their castle, under his eye. But secretly, I’ve &lt;i&gt;wanted him&lt;/i&gt; since before I even knew what the word meant. On the surface, I’m marrying him for political reasons: to stop a war and save his lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the inside, though, binding myself to Lachlan McDougall is a fantasy I’ve dreamt a thousand times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is wrong, and a sin. But once I lose myself in those dark, piercing eyes, and once I feel his big, powerful hands on me, and once I &lt;i&gt;taste&lt;/i&gt; those beautiful lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…Well, it turns out, I might not be the &lt;i&gt;only one&lt;/i&gt; with a forbidden little secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two days, I’ll be married to a man who I’ve married a hundred times, &lt;i&gt;in my head&lt;/i&gt;. The man who’s taken me to bed ten times that number in my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice my age, a scandal waiting to happen, and my best friend’s &lt;i&gt;father&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…I’m in so much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the tropes, all the growly af alpha goodness, all the over-the-top fun, and of course, WILDLY historically inaccurate.Warning: not responsible for lost or ripped bodices. Reader beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this one is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[The Highlander’s Forbidden Bride is book five in the Kilts &amp; Kisses series by Madison Faye. This is my very first book by this author. It can definitely be read as a stand alone. It’s short, scorching hot, and even a bit suspenseful!<br /><br /><img alt="sexy man in kilt - Google Search" src=...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When your Hollywood crush turns out to be the biggest D-bag on the face of the earth, can he ever redeem himself? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie's first experience on a film set could not have gone any worse. One wrong turn through a closed door and poof there goes her dreams. Now, Trevor McCain, Hollywood's "it" star had it out for her. Tired of always being pushed around, and no longer willing to sit on the sidelines, Maggie called Trevor out for who he really was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor's Hollywood's leading man and he's not afraid to use that to his advantage. Men wanted to be him, and women wanted to be with him. Life was perfect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until curvy, plain Jane Maggie walked in and ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;Who knew her confidence and ability to tell him off might be exactly what he'd been looking for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Hollywood Dreams is a standalone novel with a jerk hero who will stop at nothing to get the girl.</description>

  <description>Maddox &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason I rarely go home is three simple words: I’m a liar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the pressure to marry my childhood sweetheart became too much, I told her I was gay and then fled to New York like my ass was on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, five years later and after a drunken encounter, I find myself invited to her wedding. And I have to bring my boyfriend—the boyfriend who doesn’t exist because I’m straight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, I think I am. Meeting the guy I’m bribing to be my boyfriend for the weekend makes me question everything about myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damon &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my sister asks me to pretend to be some straight guy’s boyfriend, my automatic response is to say no. It’s because of guys like him people don’t believe me when I tell them I’m gay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Maddox has something I need. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After an injury that cost me my baseball career, I’m trying to leave my playing days behind and focus on being the best sports agent I can be. Forty-eight hours with my sister’s best friend in exchange for a meeting with a possible client. I can do this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just wish he wasn’t so hot. Or that he didn’t kiss like he means it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wait … why is the straight guy kissing me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Fake Out is a full-length MM novel with no cliffhanger.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I wanted this man’s arms around me, cocooning me in safety. I wanted to feel like I didn’t have to be brave for a few hours. I wanted to let him be my courage. My protection. My shield.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Whitbury—billionaire aerospace mogul—can engineer her way out of any problem. Sure, she’s living with the threat of a potential sex scandal thanks to her lying ex. And that attempted mugging in her parking garage might not have been a random attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she’s totally got this. Sacrifice her privacy to an overprotective bodyguard? No thanks. She doesn’t need a six-foot-five, motorcycle-riding, square-jawed, hazel-eyed man-beast shadowing her every move. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude Ellis—one-man security operation and professional problem solver—is ready to retire from the cloak and dagger stuff to live a normal life. He doesn’t need another client. Not even one with coppery-red hair and mile-long legs who looks hot AF in a sexy pair of heels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To appease her worried friends, Cameron hires Jude as her bodyguard. And despite their feisty banter and their rampant—and totally inappropriate—sex fantasies, they’re both determined to keep it professional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the danger to Cameron escalates, the heat simmering between them just might combust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s note: Big wall-of-man hero with a fierce (and growly) protective streak. Confident and snarky heroine. All the banter. Sex in a closet. And a daring rescue with a big, heart squishing HEA.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;A slow grin spread across his face and I had to turn away from the wattage. It was like staring at the sun. The handsome sun that was making my core temperature rise and causing a hormone dump in my brain. — Shelby Thompson&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal trainer Jonah Bodine discovers more than he bargained for with the half-siblings he didn’t know he had in small-town West Virginia. Not only is his dead father a person of interest in a cold case disappearance, but the entire town seems way too invested in Jonah’s happily ever after potential. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His summer of solitude in a lakeside cottage is ruined when his matchmaking sister saddles him with an unwanted roommate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adorable, snort-laughing nerd Shelby Thompson came to Bootleg Springs looking for answers and ends up getting adopted by the town’s nosy elders. Maneuvered into sharing a cottage with the handsome trainer, she makes the best of a sticky situation by offering her perpetually shirtless roommate a strings-free summer fling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonah is tempted. Very tempted. But Shelby has secrets. And as the Callie Kendall mystery unravels, Shelby’s own past comes back to haunt her. The danger is very real and so are the feelings she’s developing for Jonah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Pleasure Buttons: Small-town. Romantic comedy. Romantic suspense. Summer fling. Roommates to lovers. Rescued puppies. Family series. Mystery. Happily ever after.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>“Suddenly all those old country love songs I’d played so often made perfect sense.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gravel-voiced Gibson Bodine takes his lone wolf image seriously. The tough guy. The bad boy. He lives alone. Works alone. His one love—besides starting a good brawl—is sitting on a rinky-dink stage in a backwoods bar playing guitar and singing about things he’ll never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a video of him playing goes viral, Gibson ignores the unwanted attention. He’s got bigger things to worry about. Like the bomb his half-brother’s mom just dropped on him. And the fallout from the memento he’s been carrying around for thirteen years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t have time for fame… or love… or meddling neighbors stopping by with casseroles and questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one night in a bar, fifty miles from home, he meets her. And she changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Bootleg Springs—home of the best moonshine and nosiest neighbors in West Virginia—secrets don’t keep. When the truth about Callie Kendall’s fate brings danger home, it’s up to Gibson to step up and be the hero. And maybe find what he’s been missing all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Highball Rush is book six in the Bootleg Springs series by Claire Kingsley and Lucy Score. At long last, it’s the final book. The book with all the answers and the book with Gibson Bodine’s story. <br /><br /><img alt=" " src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/8a/37/f3/8a37f30bd30a49a39894c8ebcf884553.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /><br /><br />I never thought about it before but it is fitting that Gibson’s book was saved for last.

  <description>I Stalked Him Back (Love at First Crime #7) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He stalked her from afar for years, so now she’s returning the favor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven’t always been the best person. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve rarely made the right choices. &lt;br /&gt;I have a past that is painful and dark, &lt;br /&gt;One I didn’t think I would survive. &lt;br /&gt;But I was saved. &lt;br /&gt;And finally, after going through hell, &lt;br /&gt;Things are beginning to change. &lt;br /&gt;I’m becoming independent again. &lt;br /&gt;I’m getting stronger. &lt;br /&gt;No one but I can see this. &lt;br /&gt;He certainly can’t. &lt;br /&gt;He’s been stalking me for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;It’s his way of keeping me protected. &lt;br /&gt;And I’ve let him do this. &lt;br /&gt;But now it’s time the tables are turned. &lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time for me to protect him. &lt;br /&gt;I’m about to become the savior, &lt;br /&gt;And I won’t let him down. &lt;br /&gt;I can’t. &lt;br /&gt;Because if I fail, then I’ll lose everything. &lt;br /&gt;Stalking to save a life doesn’t sound ethical… &lt;br /&gt;Then again, as some people say: there is nothing quite like love at first … crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Author Note &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains course language, sexual situations, scenes (off page) of abuse and torture, and mentions of rape (which happened in the past of one character). If these are triggers for you then perhaps consider that this might not be a suitable book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommended for readers 17+ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I Stalked Him Back is a romantic suspense. Each previous book in this series can be read out of order, however this is the final book and I would recommend having read at least book 6 – I Poisoned Her Coworkers - to get the full scope of this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please note this book ends at approx. 41,000 words (65%-ish). There are bonus epilogues for the previous books in the series, and one for this book, which comes to approx. 20,000 words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Series Complete &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: I Stole His Car (Zander and Ava) (m/f) &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: I Knocked Him Out (Declan and Sasha) (m/f) &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: I Burned Down His House (Joey and Teagan) (m/f) &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: I Broke Into His Office (Harvey and Nix) (m/m) &lt;br /&gt;Book 5: I Blackmailed Her Brother (Cynthia and Scarlett) (f/f) &lt;br /&gt;Book 6: I Poisoned Her Coworkers (Gemma and Hunter) (m/f) &lt;br /&gt;Book 7: I Stalked Him Back (Lennox and Jerry) (m/f) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professionally edited by Traci Finlay and Erica Edits &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One mistake, and Ford lost the only woman he ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, Joey walked out of his life and into a nightmare. One that shattered her soul along with all hope of a normal life—the one she was supposed to have with Ford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After throwing himself into his career as a marine, Ford moved to Boston and, along with a blind, former Special Forces soldier, started Second Sight, one of the most elite investigative and security companies in the world. He thought he was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one phone call turns his world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a humanitarian aid mission with Doctors Without Borders, Joey's taken, stolen away and forced to witness a world where women are property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her unique skills keep her worst nightmares from coming true, but with no possibility of escape and no one to look for her, she fears she'll soon disappear forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Ford find her before she loses all hope? Or will this be his final mission?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Lethal Force&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth book in the &lt;i&gt;Away From Keyboard&lt;/i&gt; series. Each book can be read as a complete standalone, but characters from previous books do show up in future installments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains dark themes, including references to human trafficking and sexual assault. While there is no graphic description of sexual violence, sensitive readers should be aware of these themes before purchasing.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The epic conclusion to the thrilling Dangerous Beauty series.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The game isn’t over until somebody dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva knows what it’s like to be imprisoned by a man’s twisted obsessions. But after running, hiding, and finding refuge in a rescuer’s arms, she’s suddenly pulled back into the black hole of her past. Kidnapped by her sadistic ex, Dimitri, and with the love of her life left for dead, Eva is facing down the worst of her demons alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dimitri wants to play sick games, Eva’s ready. She already knows how dark they can get. But despite her fears, she hasn’t been abandoned. Naz is in hot pursuit. And the last thing Dimitri expects is for a dead man to come calling. For Eva and Naz, worlds apart yet bound by fierce and unbreakable passion, it’s time to beat the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do it they’ll have to be just as ruthless, seductive, and cunning. With every pulse of the heart, they must risk it all to play Dimitri’s final game to its harrowing end—and win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PART 3 OF 3 (Not a standalone)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Motherly love can drive her to the absolute edge…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nine years, Drew Baker has been running from her brutal husband and the dark deeds of the night she left him. Focused on protecting her ten-year-old son, Drew reluctantly settles into a small town, eager to find proof of her husband’s true nature so she can stop looking over her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Drew is also on the run from her own terrible crimes—ones that mean prison and separation from her son should the police catch up to her before her husband does. If only she could remember that night and what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; transpired…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without warning, the unthinkable happens, and Drew is plunged into the most nightmarish situation a woman and mother could imagine. Desperate to save her child, Drew takes matters into her own hands, proving that anyone is capable of darkness, and nowhere is safe for those who fear themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Rainy Day Friends&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lost and Found Sisters&lt;/i&gt; returns to Wildstone, California...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke Lemon has always led the life she wanted, wild adventures—and mistakes—included, something her perfect sister, Mindy, never understood. So when Mindy shows up on Brooke’s doorstep in the throes of a break-down with her three little kids in tow, Brooke’s shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to make amends, Brooke agrees to trade places, taking the kids back to Wildstone for a few days so Mindy can pick up the pieces and put herself back together. What Brooke doesn’t admit is she’s just as broken . . . Also how does one go home after seven years away? It doesn’t take long for Brooke to come face-to-face with her past, in the form of one tall, dark, sexy mistake. But Garrett’s no longer interested. Only his words don’t match his actions, leaving Brooke feeling things she’d shoved deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the sisters begin to wonder: Are they lemons in life? In love? All they know is that neither seems to be able to run far enough to outpace her demons. And when secrets surface, they’ll have to learn that sometimes the one person who can help you the most is the one you never thought to ask.</description>

  <description>Rett Davis doesn’t rescue people. Not anymore. The former Special Forces operative has made a quiet home in the mountains of Idaho, surrounded by solitude and the horses that need him. He prefers four-legged creatures to the two-legged kind anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he lays eyes on her.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Izzy Kozlov doesn’t lean on anyone. It isn’t safe. But when the young dancer’s past catches up to her in the most violent of ways, she doesn’t have a choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The big man with the dark eyes and the perpetual scowl won’t give her one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rett is determined to keep Izzy safe, but she’s just as determined to keep her secrets. When a storm sweeps down off the mountain and those secrets come calling at last, Rett must perform one more rescue…  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And hope it doesn’t go like the last one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come read about the men and women of Purgatory, Idaho, perpetually caught somewhere between heaven and hell. *Rescue Me features Dane “Fish’ Munroe from Susan Stoker’s Rescuing Bryn. </description>

  <description>Koviye&lt;br /&gt;My people call me the Sex God, but I, Koviye of the Fellamana, am so much more. I read their every desire and satisfy them with a mere touch of my hands. I’m sworn to share my powers, and this thing humans call monogamy is biologically impossible for me, or so I thought until I met the human, Jenie, Lieutenant General in the rebellion against our mutual enemy determined to destroy us. Now, as though Jenie has some power over me, I cannot think of touching anyone but her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenie&lt;br /&gt;I’ve dreamt of Koviye every night since I landed on this sex planet where every breath I take is an aphrodisiac to my blood. I am not fully human, I am part alien, and the planet has awakened my body’s instinct to find a mate. The next person I have sex with I will form an attachment for life, which is impossible for the Sex God. I have a rebellion to lead. Mating a polyamorous alien would ruin me. I can never have him, no matter how much I burn for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I need his help. My best friend was taken prisoner by our enemies, the Ten Systems, and the only person with a ship fast enough to save her is Koviye. And all those dreams I’ve been having about him aren’t just dreams, he tells me. They’re real. He can dream walk, so if I can’t have him while I’m awake, at least I can have him in my dreams—as if that will ever be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Planet of Desire series is STANDALONE:&lt;br /&gt;* Toxic Desire&lt;br /&gt;* Captive Desire&lt;br /&gt;* Stolen Desire</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Kearney Brothers from Ireland are riding into Bear Creek … and into your heart!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tessa Mandel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catcalls and whistles get old, but cowboys are a necessary evil when you work at the Bear Creek Rodeo. While rodeo life isn’t for me, it’s the only thing supporting my secret side career. I live a double life, but I know my dream of returning to the big city is close to becoming reality. If being an orphan has taught me anything, it’s that you can’t count on anyone but yourself. Working for the rodeo brings many distractions and I can’t afford the complications that come with sliding between the sheets with a smooth talker in tight jeans and a cowboy hat. I have big plans for myself and none of them include being charmed by any of these cowboy Casanovas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I meet the infamous Rhett Kearney, who makes my stomach flutter by just saying my name. One kiss from his gorgeous Irish lips turn my world upside down and my panties inside out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My timeline doesn’t include falling for a handsome cowboy… but it might be too late for that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rhett Kearney&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of the top bronc riders in the world, I’m no stranger to hard work that draws out blood, sweat and tears. Every time I leave Ireland to compete, I feel the weight of my birthright square on my shoulders, but nothing compares to the roar of a crowd when I climb onto that bucking horse, riding it as hard as I can for those eight seconds. The goal has always been the same — compete in US National Rodeo Finals and make as much money as I can. It’s a race against time, as age is not your friend when you are a professional cowboy. So I don’t waste my time chasing skirts and getting tangled up with a pretty face who’s looking for her next meal ticket out of town.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I couldn’t prepare myself for the sassy Tessa Mandel or the punch to the gut when I see her beautiful baby blue eyes flare with desire, making me want to risk it all for one more taste of her honeysuckle kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t travel halfway around the world to lose. I’m taking home my grand prize… she just doesn’t know it’s her yet.</description>

  <description>Archangel Uriel is hell bent on revenge on the demon prince Vladek. To get into the prince’s impenetrable fortress, he’ll have to fight in the pits of the underworld. And he’ll need the help of the last person he can trust––the demon witch Nadya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way Nadya, who spends her days taking care of others, expected to find Uriel on her doorstep. He seems no happier about being there than she does. But helping him means evening the scales against her backstabbing sister, and she’ll do whatever it takes to make that bitch pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the fight pit circuits in the demon underworld, Nadya helps Uriel combat his way to the arena at the castle in Russia. Only she isn’t what she seems. As a matter of fact, she may hold the key to his redemption...and to his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Dominion series is STANDALONE:&lt;br /&gt;* The Deepest Well (prequel)&lt;br /&gt;* Darkest Heart&lt;br /&gt;* Hardest Fall&lt;br /&gt;* Coldest Fire</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One tall, dark, and broody professor + One overachieving college student = Chemistry they can’t erase.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I was asked to babysit for a single father, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Two months with Mr. tall, dark, and broody didn’t seem like a bad trade-off for the money he would pay me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the weeks go by, our attraction grows and I realize what a concerned and caring father he is. And he learns that not every woman is untrustworthy like his ex-wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We both agree to walk away from our fling when I leave for college at the end of summer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And reluctantly, we do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until my first day of classes when he crashes back into my world. &lt;br /&gt;“I’m Professor Decker. Welcome to King University.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Depravity&lt;/i&gt; is part of the &lt;i&gt;King University&lt;/i&gt; series, but can be read as a complete standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Blade McCormick is not a nice guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s pure adrenaline and smells like smoke and leather—the kind of guy you look at and know he’s going to be a combination of nasty and irresistible. The moment I allowed myself to touch his hot skin and kiss his full lips, I. Was. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like currency, I’ve become part of a transaction. Blade took me to pay off a debt. I try to tell myself, Eve, you should hate him. He’s a bad guy. But then again, I’m not a good girl. Blade’s the president of the Disciples, the notorious motorcycle club. I should be frightened, yet somehow, he doesn’t scare me. If anything, I think I scare him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of work to become the club’s Queen, but I’ll stop at nothing to have the King!</description>

  <description>Savagery. Sin. Depravity—-these are my virtues. &lt;br /&gt;My religion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Dante Sovrano, head of the Chicago Mob,&lt;br /&gt;and I run this city.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone bows down to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I saw Sarah, I knew she’d be trouble. &lt;br /&gt;She’s fiery and cutthroat, wrapped up in a lickable package. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are dark secrets hiding behind those gorgeous blue eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I plan to know them all because she’ll have to make a deal with the devil to solve her problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the devil always takes your soul.&lt;br /&gt;And I’ll be keeping it—&lt;br /&gt;Because Sarah London is mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newest ALPHA in A Sinful Series is the definition of depraved. Dante Sovrano is ruthless and knows exactly who and what he wants. Good luck standing in his way. &lt;br /&gt;***Depraved can be read as a standalone***</description>

      <![CDATA[Depraved is book three in the Sinful series by Trilina Pucci. I think this book might be a little darker than the other two. Or, it’s just been a while since I have read the previous book and have forgotten. But take my word for it, Dante is part monster. But the other part of him, the part that...]]>

  <description>*Prequel to Faking Ms. Right*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating can be tricky, but how hard can it be to find the right guy? Or even just a normal guy? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Everly Dalton, it’s a bit like trying to walk in stilettos—while drunk, blindfolded, and wearing the wrong size shoes. She hasn’t exactly been lucky in love. In fact, she just might be cursed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A guy who only dates lookalikes of his ex? Pass. An alpha-male businessman who bolts in a moment of crisis? No thanks. A date that turns into the creepiest interview in the history of ever? Where does she find these guys? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join Everly as she dishes to her friends about the surprising, unpredictable, and sometimes crazy adventure that is modern dating. Will she keep matching with frogs or find her Prince Charming? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everly Dalton’s Dating Disasters&lt;/i&gt; originally appeared as six serial episodes in Claire Kingsley’s newsletter. The complete series is available here in one volume. Each episode is an account of one of Everly’s (typically terrible) dates. This series of short stories takes place before the full-length, stand-alone hot romcom, &lt;i&gt;Faking Ms. Right&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Going off script&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgraced PR rep, Elizabeth Willison, can’t afford to be picky about clients, even if that means spending winter at the freezing Jersey Shore with the reclusive Hollywood bad boy no one else will touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past-his-prime action star, Cole Jenkins, will do whatever it takes to redeem his image and revive his career. Even if that means choking on his pride while filming the low-budget lifeguard series, and continually butting heads with the stubborn woman attempting to remake his image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the frigid set, things heat up when Elizabeth and Cole find that together they can overcome gossiping fans and underhanded producers. But how will they play their parts when real life doesn't stick to the script?</description>

  <description>I poisoned her coworkers, so she injected me with a lethal dose of unrequited love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past we had it all.&lt;br /&gt;Or at least, we seemed to.&lt;br /&gt;Then I let her down.&lt;br /&gt;We both made mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;We fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter the years that passed us by,&lt;br /&gt;I never forgot about her.&lt;br /&gt;So when my brother falls headfirst into trouble, &lt;br /&gt;I know who to call on.&lt;br /&gt;I know she will help me.&lt;br /&gt;Even if she wishes I would disappear from her life.&lt;br /&gt;Even if she hates me.&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t give up this time without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;I will do everything in my power to win her back.&lt;br /&gt;There might be some stumbles along the way…&lt;br /&gt;Like an accidental poisoning for example.&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t let that stop me.&lt;br /&gt;Through gunfire and car chases,&lt;br /&gt;I will make sure she knows she can rely on me.&lt;br /&gt;We’re in this together,&lt;br /&gt;Forever and always.&lt;br /&gt;Who cares if things don’t get off to a great start?&lt;br /&gt;What does it matter that her coworkers think I’m dangerous?&lt;br /&gt;Is almost killing them worth throwing away what we have?&lt;br /&gt;Then again, as some people say: there is nothing quite like love at first … crime.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes an uncomfortably hilarious Mystery with a heaping help of sexual frustration, &lt;i&gt;THE LIBRARIAN’S VAMPIRE ASSISTANT, Book Three.&lt;/i&gt; (Yep! It’s a STAND-ALONE. But why not read them all because…fun!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOUR BOSS JUST CAN’T GET MORE AWKWARD...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Vanderhorst is not your usual vampire. For starters, he works in a library, is in love with Miriam, his hot nerdy human boss who has no clue what he is, and he looks like a college student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, Michael is an ancient deadly vampire, an ex-assassin, and is currently the de facto king of his kind ever since their ruling party disappeared. To where? He doesn’t know, but if he wants his life back, he’ll have to find out. (Mystery!) Especially because a civil war is brewing, and being king makes his librarian a mark for his enemies. (She is, after all, his biggest weakness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a global uprising about to explode, Michael must give her the protection of his army. Only one problem: She must become his queen first. But every attempt he makes to tell her the truth is met with extreme hostility. “Vampires aren’t real. That’s crazy talk, Michael!” Clearly, the topic frightens her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out and her life on the line, Michael is left with one option: Marry her. Without her knowing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he pull it off? And what will happen when the fight comes to their door?</description>

  <description>Gabriel Starr is the love of my life, even if he breaks my heart time and time again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like a fool, I keep going back, so I’ve made a promise to myself—one final night and then I’m done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night of passion. &lt;br /&gt;No pressure. Most importantly, no future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month later, a positive pregnancy test tells me different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our only option is to raise this baby as friends, but how can we make it work when we can’t even keep our hands off each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally have the chance to be the family we never imagined we could be. &lt;br /&gt;But first we need to focus on Fixing Us.&lt;br /&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It’s time I stop letting fear control me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over a decade, I dedicated my life to raising our children and being the perfect housewife. But it wasn’t enough. My husband, the man who claimed to love me and promised me forever, needed more. He needed others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of leaving, I turned a blind eye. I smiled. I remained faithful. I &lt;i&gt;stayed&lt;/i&gt; for my children, and for the promise I made—for better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there comes a time when something happens, when bruises are discovered, and you realize staying is more dangerous than leaving. That’s when nothing—not the fear of the unknown or being nothing without him—can hold you back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s when you fight. You say . . . enough is enough. Because no one has more strength, more devotion, and more courage than a mother defending her young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother who is &lt;i&gt;more than enough&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If you love a strong heroine, a protective hero, and a sweet and sexy with all the goodness &lt;b&gt;romance&lt;/b&gt;, then &lt;i&gt;More Than Enough&lt;/i&gt; is for you. Due to language and certain material, this story is recommended for readers 18 and up. So, if you're 18 and up, put your feet up, get comfortable, and happy reading!</description>

  <description>She’s always been his safe place to land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jensen has shared a special bond with Tuck for as long as she can remember, their friendship a language that never needed words. But as life threw her one curveball after another, that secret language turned to stony silence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s always been her protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuck has looked out for Jensen since the day she was born. As his best friend’s little sister, he’s tried to keep her firmly in the friend category. But she’s always been more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one moment of weakness to send Tuck’s fiercely guarded walls crumbling to the ground. As a new fire burns between them, someone watches. Someone who doesn’t like the new life Jensen’s building for herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they’ll stop at nothing to keep her in the dark.</description>

  <description>Hannah Stewart’s always been different when it comes to relationships. Monogamy doesn’t work for her. She needs more. And more is something most people can’t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gets more than she bargains for, though, when she partners up with local brewery owners Mitchell and Ben for a business venture and finds herself attracted to both of them. She proposes polyamory, where she dates each of them with their full consent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchell Fredericks and Ben Harrington have been “friends with benefits” for years. But with Hannah in the mix, it’s not so easy to ignore emotions. She brings out a side of them they’d never been willing to face head-on, especially as their separate relationships shift into a menage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desire, friendship, and boundaries will be put to the test. If they can’t learn to swallow their fear and communicate, everything will fall apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One shared look across a crowded club, and their worlds collided.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their attraction had been instantaneous and hotter than the fire burning in his soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Blake Stone didn't do relationships. Relationships meant emotions, and he didn’t have the kind a woman would want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or need. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anger, greed, lust, bitterness, hatred—he had in spades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But a woman like Gwen, she would want more. And if he wanted to keep her, he'd need to reveal his secrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secrets that could send her running. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because she’s playing with fire, and he knew damn well how badly it burned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FIRE is a full-length, standalone, contemporary romance with a HEA. * **Contains sexual situations, violence, sensitive subjects, offensive language, and mature topics.*** Recommended for age 18 years and up. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He didn’t think coming home would mean falling in love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outfielder Calvin Ramsey returns to his Texas farm home after being released from his team, an unexpected surprise sure to tarnish the family baseball legacy. But when he finds a sexy stranger acting as the temporary caretaker for his childhood home, all thoughts of baseball disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She won’t fall for another player&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her savings to a swindler ex-boyfriend, Josie Vance moves to Last Stand to start fresh where no one knows her unhappy past or the con that bankrupted her. But her peaceful healing time evaporates when the homeowner’s son arrives and throws himself into life on the farm—and charming Josie. She can’t risk an affair that draws attention to her or her past. Especially not when the public’s fascination with the baseball-playing Ramsey clan is at an all-time high. Can she keep her secrets, her low profile, and her heart too?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“When I kissed you last night, I wasn’t pretending.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everly Dalton is a walking, talking, martini-drinking dating disaster. Forget kissing frogs. She can’t even get past the first date. But at work, she’s a badass—the longest-running assistant billionaire Shepherd Calloway has ever had. Her coworkers wonder how she handles the big bad wolf—and never gets bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shepherd Calloway isn’t interested in being anyone’s sugar daddy. Tired of women who only want him for his money, he swears off dating, determined to focus on running his empire. Until his gold-digging ex hits him where it hurts, putting him in a difficult position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His solution—to have Everly pose as his live-in girlfriend—is obviously crazy. But the timing is uncanny. It just so happens Everly needs a favor from her boss—a big and awkward one—and this could ensure everyone gets what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, Everly can totally survive a few months of faux romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except there’s a problem. Shepherd is supposed to be a single-minded, unemotional robot boss. Not an actual human with a heart and morning wood. Between the awkward bed-sharing and tingly fake dates, lines are blurring. And as Everly gets to know the real Shepherd, she discovers there’s more to the man behind the bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And faking it gets all too real.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faking Ms. Right is a hot, STAND-ALONE romantic comedy.</description>

  <description>CASEY&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been putting my son first for so long that I’ve forgotten how to be me. Each monotonous day bleeds into the next, and I feel like I’m struggling to keep my head above water. &lt;br /&gt;But a kiss at the top of a Ferris wheel with a man I barely know changes that.&lt;br /&gt;Jay reminds me that I used to be bold. Vivacious. Funny.&lt;br /&gt;Strong.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could convince him his past mistakes don’t define the man he is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JAY&lt;br /&gt;I can perform over a dozen illusions with a simple sleight of hand, but I can’t make the felony on my record disappear. &lt;br /&gt;The last thing I should be doing is hanging around a young single mom and her kid.&lt;br /&gt;But Casey doesn’t know that I’ve been watching her. That I want her for myself. That I’m addicted to her dimples, her tenacity, her fierce love for her child.&lt;br /&gt;If I was a better man, I’d leave her alone, but she pulls off the biggest magic trick of all time: making me believe I’m a good guy.</description>

      <![CDATA[Magic Man is the newest addition to The Good Guys series by Jamie Schlosser. Of course, this is the first book I’ve read of this series but I loved it so much that I already have purchased the previous books in the series and plan to start at the beginning. Each book can be read as a stand alone....]]>

  <description>Life regret number one: Moving into an apartment where all I hear are the moans coming from my downstairs neighbor's apartment. It's pretty obvious what's happening behind those doors, which is even more frustrating when you aren't getting any action yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I got fired from my job, and my savings account is pathetic. That means I can't eat my body weight in donuts, even if I wanted to...and I really want to. Thanks to my sister, though, I have a new work opportunity lined up, and I promised myself I wouldn't do anything to lose this one. Until I realize my new boss, Logan, is none other than my sex god of a neighbor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my ever-growing attraction to him in check proves to be a lot harder than I thought, especially with my knowledge of his extracurricular activities. When my new job as his photography assistant keeps throwing us together--sometimes completely eliminating our personal space--I find it more and more difficult to remember why I'm supposed to stay away from him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, I'm Ember Keaton, and I suck at adulting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Best Kind Of Mistake is a fun, sweet, and romantic standalone novella with a HEA.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I can look, but I can’t touch.&lt;br /&gt;As the enforcer of The Lost Boys MC, I am used to getting my hands dirty. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve always kept my emotions in check. &lt;br /&gt;It helps given the position I am in. &lt;br /&gt;When I was tasked with watching over our President’s sister, I was ready for it. &lt;br /&gt;What I wasn’t ready for, is how that beauty would pull at my heart. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve known Ella for years. &lt;br /&gt;After a horrible break up with her ex, all I wanted to do was protect her. &lt;br /&gt;But now, all I want is to bend her over and make her mine. &lt;br /&gt;I know I should resist her. &lt;br /&gt;But I think my heart has other plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas is the first book of The Lost Boys MC.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes a Standalone, Romantic Comedy a la Paranormal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;COLEL&lt;/i&gt;(Book #5, The Immortal Matchmakers, Inc. Series).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;This book contains foul language, gratuitous sex against a truck, outrageously rude immortal warriors in leather pants, snow, pigheaded gods, a sexually frustrated goddess, a very hot and hunky florist guy with a bad attitude and a big secret, Brutus bubble baths, a sneaky invisible unicorn, unrequited love, bees, bees, and more bees, and chocolates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOMETIMES LOVE BITES AND SOMETIMES IT STINGS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colel, the Goddess of Bees, has been looking for Mr. Right for over seventy thousand years. So when she meets the hunky owner of a small-town flower shop and explodes with flutters and tingles, she’s almost certain that he’s the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two problems: her tiny black-and-yellow army suddenly won’t let her anywhere near him, and…is that a freaking epinephrine pen in the fridge? “Dear gods! He’s allergic to bees? Say it isn’t so.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If simply dating the guy will kill him, how will she ever know for sure if he’s really the one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colel has a solution, but it’s drastic. Even for her. And what if he says no?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;From USA Today best selling Author Vanessa Fewings comes a scorching new novel set in London. &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A woman's first ménage à trois romance with two mysterious British men with untold influence. Their love fuels the power that pervades London.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;From an early age, Emily lived for the violin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practices were a joy. Recitals were a celebration. She only felt truly alive when the meticulously crafted, finely tuned, string instrument was in her firm grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could say that Emily lived for the violin, and that it was her true love. You would have been right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but that all changed the day she met Xander Rothschild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Rampling thought she understood the nature of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she didn't know the unexpected forms power could take, bending and adapting to suit its needs. She wasn't aware of the ways power could infiltrate unnoticed into the highest echelons of government, soaking the most hallowed chambers with its influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't realize the methods in which power could weave an invisible fabric that manipulated society with hidden secrets and unannounced agendas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Emily Rampling didn't understand anything at all about the nature of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she was about to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;pulse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;penetrate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the ways power could &lt;strong&gt;PERVADE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The last man she should love is the only man she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future looks bright for Cathy Gold, recent summa cum laude graduate, until her controlling father snatches away her dream job, insisting she marry the nice Jewish boy next door. So, she jumps at the chance for one last taste of freedom as temporary bookkeeper at a Catskills resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Cullen used hard work and Irish charm to escape the factory that maimed him and took his father's life. As manager of the resort, he's working toward his own American dream. He doesn't need the distraction of the strong-willed and brilliant Cathy, but he can't resist the passion that flares when they are together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Irish immigrant is the last person Cathy's parents would choose for her, but he's the only man to encourage her ambitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would have a chance at a future together if it weren't for 1948 rules on class, religion, and gender, and a sudden scandal at the resort that threatens them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To succeed in love and their American dreams, they must refuse to give up, and be willing to break the rules.</description>

  <description>Two years ago Van King killed a man and saved my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve thought about the handsome private investigator every day since, fantasized about what would happen when I finally saw him again. And when I do, it’s far from the reunion of my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A copycat serial killer wants to finish what I barely survived. Van rushes to my side once more, and shows me the man he truly is: protective, possessive, merciless, especially when it comes to me and my safety. He thinks I’m afraid of him. But I’ve loved Van from the moment his dark, enigmatic gaze met mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I won’t allow my fear or debilitating shyness to rule me. I sure as hell won’t hide from the heat that explodes between us while I’m under his protection. No, I’ll welcome it and beg for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;“Now there was nothing holding me back. I kissed her deeply, passionately. Kissed her for every time I’d wanted to and couldn’t. For every time I’d stared at her with longing in my heart, wishing we could be where we were now.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s never too late.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loving a woman you can’t have isn’t easy. I endured the slow torture of watching Shannon Miles live a life with another man — a man who didn’t deserve her — but I don’t regret a minute of it. And I have my reasons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, she’s free. No longer shackled to a loveless marriage, bound to someone who was unfaithful and heartless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Shannon thinks her time has passed. That she won’t get another chance at love, especially not with the man who’s been there to see it all. The hurt. The mistakes. The heartache. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only she knew. I love that woman with everything I am, and I want nothing more in this life than to spend every moment with her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time for our happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Run-away breeder Ava Davies only wanted to live life on her own terms. Now she’s captive in a labor camp deep within Dragath25’s core, a sweltering maze of caves overrun by brutal prisoners-turned-slaves. Her only chance for survival? Appeasing the leader of the most powerful subterranean gang: a man from her past with his own score to settle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, resistance fighter Hunter Valdus’s and his men were sentenced by the Council to live and die as slaves. Now a beautiful, desperate female from his past has landed in his grasp. A woman who just might be the key to his crew’s escape and his revenge. All he has to do is keep her alive and at a distance until he can use her for his own dark purposes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But raw, blood-pounding lust is a potent force. Forgiveness and love even stronger. And the best-laid plans can be laid to waste, especially on Dragath25. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TAKEN, Book Two in the Condemned Series, is an action-packed sci-fi prison planet romance that burrows to the deepest, hottest recesses of the globe to explore what happens when revenge and lust, redemption and love, collide. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could you handle ten men?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was little, my momma told me that I was probably gonna need to kiss a whole lotta frogs before I found my prince.&lt;br /&gt;Her definition of a prince is Roderick McGregor, owner of the biggest property development company in the state with ten of the most gorgeous sons in the northern hemisphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ten! Yeah, I said ten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding  I'm going to have a stepbrother would be bad enough, but ten is a whole other ball game. Then I overhear my new stepbrothers talking about 'the plan' and I'm flabbergasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding &lt;i&gt;the one&lt;/i&gt; is hard enough...finding &lt;i&gt;ten&lt;/i&gt; should be impossible.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;100,000 word&lt;/b&gt; standalone mega menage/reverse harem romance. It involves MMMMMFMMMMM situations with a very happy ever after ending. Well, there are ten men involved! It's part of the Huge Series; standalone romances with lots of HUGE goodness to link them all. Read in any order! No cliffhangers. No cheating.</description>

  <description>The Duke boys were nicknamed for cuts of meat. Sir Loin Of Beef. T-Bone. Tri-Tip. Porterhouse. We were a ranching family after all. And me? I was known as Skirt Steak. I didn’t think much of it until Cash and Bennett, because they told me—and showed me—how much they liked my pink center, said it was juicy and lick-their-lips good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going take their word for it. Every single time they made me come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: With a Vanessa Vale book, one cowboy is never enough. In this smokin' hot series, each heroine gets an extra helping (or two) of Grade-A Beefcake.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;**An Older Brother's Best Friend Romance**&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowley Ford, my brother's best friend, is easy to worship and impossible to forget. &lt;i&gt;Believe me, I've tried.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was once my protector and hero, but after Kat, his longtime girlfriend, played a humiliating trick on me I decided it was time to quit fan-girling over him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, it wasn't that hard to avoid someone once they'd gone off to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when Rowley finally returned to town, he pursued a career as a firefighter. (Of course, he would choose a heroic profession.) Fighting fires in California can keep you pretty damn busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keeping my distance never stopped me from pricking up my ears anytime Rowley's name was mentioned. I know that he's already been promoted to fire captain and that Kat left him because he wouldn't commit to marriage. According to my source, it's a gambit. Kat's sure that in the end she'll get that engagement ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell her from experience that marriage isn't worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently married a singer from a locally famous rock band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even more recently, I divorced him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I've made the mistake of doing something a little reckless, which puts me back into Rowley's orbit. When he catches me skinny dipping, he's the figure of authority in his firefighter's uniform while I'm naked and vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on the top of this embarrassing reunion is the fact that he doesn't even recognize me. I guess he never considered that his best friend's little sister would grow up some day. But the biggest change, the one he doesn't care for—it's that I'm no longer the compliant, adoring girl who tagged along and obeyed him without question. That silly girl, the one who fantasized about a future with him, is long gone.</description>

      <![CDATA[Hero Worship is by a new to me author, Emery Cross. This is probably one of the hardest reviews I’ve written. This book brought forth so many different emotions. These two were a mess.

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;Under Fyre Prequel&lt;/i&gt; tells what happened during the friendly early encounters between dragons and humans. On his first diplomatic tour of Earth, young Prince K’ev meets a child, Rhianna Montclair. As an adult, she will become his concubine, his mate, his everything. Both are unaware of how important that first meeting is and how everything soon will change…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: The prequel is a 2500-word prologue to the main 60,000-word novel, &lt;i&gt;Under Fyre&lt;/i&gt;.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s everything she has ever desired. But there’s only one way to keep her man alive: let him go.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Nasir’s life on the line, Eva makes a deal with the devil. She slips away to return to Dimitri, the mob boss who held her captive for years, only to step into a new world of trouble. Abducted by one of Dimitri’s most cunning adversaries, Eva finds herself an unwitting pawn in a dangerous game of cat and mouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eva disappears, Naz is prepared to do anything to find her. Tracking her to the remote regions of Portugal is just the beginning of the hunt. Bewitched by Eva’s beauty, the darkly seductive spy who abducted her now has more than business on his mind, but the only way for the trio to defeat Dimitri is to work together…despite the explosive desires threatening to consume them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a game so deadly and the stakes so high, Naz and Eva’s love will be tested in ways neither of them could foresee…or perhaps survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Seventeen Years Ago.&lt;/i&gt; The first time Aaron Andrews saw Simon Foster smile, he knew he was in trouble. He’d never seen anything—or anyone—like the man who’d stolen his favorite seat in his favorite coffee shop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Six Weeks Ago.&lt;/i&gt; The late-night phone call that changed their lives forever was short. Four little words was all it took to set them on a different path—one that included new toys (not that kind), a dose of homophobia (been there), and an appreciation for spandex (though they always appreciated it . . .)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today.&lt;/i&gt; That’s what Aaron and Simon are focused on as they try to plan the best birthday in the history of ever, all for the little boy who has quickly become their world. Even if that means dealing with too-tight costumes, a cape that won’t behave, a meddlesome family . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;. . . and a past that won’t stay there. &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My first crush. My first heartbreak. My brother’s best friend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butterflies in my stomach turned into full blown eagles the second our lips touched. A kiss under the stars that changed our relationship forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of wishing, I stared up into Ford’s eyes with his fingers caressing my cheek and my heart racing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening ended with my heart bleeding on the ballroom floor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He destroyed my heart two years ago...but now he wants back in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I won’t fall under his spell. I’ll resist his sexy, scruffy beard, and panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was over him. Hell, I fully planned to wave to him through my rearview mirror...but with one text, in the middle of the night, I know I'm in over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ford: I need you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“How long do you last in bed?” Those were her first words to me, swiftly followed up with, “And how big would you say you are?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persephone Alexander. Math genius. Lover of blazers. The only girl I know who can make Heidi braids look sexy as hell. And she’s on a mission. Lose her virginity by the end of the semester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked in on her interview session for potential candidates (who even does that?) and saw straight through her brave front. She’s got a list of Firsts to accomplish like she’s only got months to live. I’ve decided to be her guide for all her firsts except one. Someone’s got to keep her out of trouble. I have one rule, no sex. We even shook on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll help her find the right guy for the job. Someone like her doesn’t need someone like me and my massive...baggage for her first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking at a bar. Check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partying all night. Double check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny dipping. Triple check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met. The walls I’d put up around my heart are slowly crumbling with each touch that sets fire to my soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the first to bend the rules. One electrifying kiss changes everything and suddenly I don’t want to be her first, I want to be her only. But her plan was written before I came onto the scene and now I’m determined to get her to re-write her future with me.</description>

  <description>As the Chief of Pediatric Cardiology at Grady Memorial, Karlee Shae Kinkade deals with hearts all day long-- young ones, and she’s the best at mending them when they’re broken.&lt;br /&gt;With a schedule like hers, there’s no time for love. Her patients need her.&lt;br /&gt;She’s tried finding it on her own, but love is fickle when time is precious.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, she gets that warm, fuzzy feeling that love brings from her patients and her ‘Magic Brew’ at the local coffee shop. They say there’s a love potion in those coffee beans. If there is, put it in an IV bag and hook Karlee up STAT.&lt;br /&gt;While she is saving lives and finding cures for heart disease, her friends are getting engaged or married, and some are starting families. Karlee feels her biological clock ticking with no future husband in sight.&lt;br /&gt;That is until the hot new Emergency doctor stalks her to find out where the ‘Magic Brew’ comes from.&lt;br /&gt;He’s bold and funny, with an accent like James Bond and a smile that will make your heart explode. There are only two things holding her back…he’s a colleague and she isn’t a fan of the hospital rumor mill. She’s seen enough of Grey’s Anatomy to know she doesn’t need that kind of drama in her life.&lt;br /&gt;Can Karlee throw caution to the wind and follow what her own heart is telling her?</description>

  <description>Special Forces Sergeant Dax Holloway crawled out of the Taliban's clutches barely alive. His captors took more than his sight. They took his humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, he’s carved out an existence back in Boston. One dependent on routines. On walking the same path. Day after day. Through darkness and pain. Always alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Sight is his only refuge. The most elite investigative firm in the country—built from the rubble of his former life—gives him purpose in a world he can no longer see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evianna Archer’s life makes sense. A brilliant coder, she’s poised to be the next darling of the tech world—heading up a project that will redefine home security. Until one moment changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life in chaos, she turns to Dax for protection. He's everything she shouldn’t want, shouldn’t need, shouldn’t trust. But she’s drawn to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they uncover a shocking secret, Dax must make a choice. Stay broken? Or risk his heart—and his life—for the woman who chases all his dark shadows away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second Sight&lt;/i&gt; is a slow burn military romantic thriller. All books in the &lt;i&gt;Away From Keyboard&lt;/i&gt; series are standalone romances featuring a different couple, but past couples and characters play active roles in future books.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>She was never meant to be his… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two ruthless enemies. &lt;br /&gt;One cage. &lt;br /&gt;Zero chance of escape. &lt;br /&gt;An explosive lust that can’t be contained. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Council assassin Jade Lakotesh survives by trusting no one. Attachments a weakness. Sex a weapon. Her mission success rate flawless. Until she ends up naked, captured, and collared, her latest assignment in jeopardy. The blame for her predicament: the hothead, scarred man who prowls the cage beside her—his confusing appeal a danger she has no idea how to neutralize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ex-Resistance fighter Walsh Ryker hit rock bottom with the deaths of those he loved most. Now, he’s plummeted to a new low, trapped with a cellmate as ice cold as she is stunningly hot. She’s out for blood, lacks any ability to cooperate…and leaves him more alive than he’s been in years. For a man no longer interested in feeling anything at all, she may be the greatest hazard he’s faced to date. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As danger mounts and they must work together to defeat a shared threat, will the unwelcome passion between these two enemies entomb them in the dark forever—or be the key that sets them free? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TORMENTED, Book Three in the Condemned series, is a stand-alone, high heat, action-adventure romance that hurtles to the ends of the universe to explore redemption and forgiveness, need and love, and the power of second chances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like the other books in the Condemned series, TORMENTED can stand on its own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book does come with a trigger warning. Dragath25 is a dark, brutal prison planet. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;They can’t change the past…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;but they can choose their future&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Globe-trotting journalist Cassidy Fulton is back in Carbondale, Colorado. Only she can’t remember why—or the accident that killed her estranged sister. Helping her piece together this mystery is her brother-in-law and former fiancé, Daryl Loveland. Overcoming their grief seems impossible. Yet one thing is clear: Cassidy can’t imagine her life without Daryl or her adorable niece and nephew. But can the ranch ever really be her home?</description>

  <description>Vince Morrison, known to most people as Van. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good with his hands, be it crafting a piece of wood, playing his guitar, or pleasing a lover—he excels at them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friendly, flirty, and talented, he’s cool under pressure, and hot everywhere else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he keeps his heart closed, even as his interest and emotions are tested. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia Rourke works alongside him at BAM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talented, private, and intriguing, she touches something inside him he can’t deny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to know her. In every possible way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants her to know him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her past tells her to stay clear. Van is everything that she wants, and exactly what she cannot have. She has someone else to think of who is more important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can either of them risk their hearts?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I was issued a warning: stay away from Ben Rosenberg.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clifton Cove’s resident “king”, he thinks he’s entitled to anyone and anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, I’ve spent my whole life following the rules and playing it safe. I know what it feels like to be the good girl. I’m the police chief’s daughter and a librarian—&lt;i&gt;for adorable children&lt;/i&gt;, no less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-nighter with a fictional hunk is about as exciting as my life gets until one day, fate decides to take pity on me and shove me straight into the path of Mr. Off-Limits himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I suspected, every inch of him promises to be my demise. Up close, he’s tall, menacing—a lawyer who looks like he’ll bite. A well-behaved girl would do as she’s told and avoid him at all costs, but I’m overdue for a little rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ignore the warning and throw caution to the wind. But Ben doesn’t just nudge me out of my comfort zone—he thrusts me into a dark corner and presses his hard body against mine, covering my mouth with his hand to ensure we don’t get caught sneaking around. In that moment, I finally understand why everyone thinks he’s going to ruin me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To him, this is all a game. &lt;br /&gt;He wants to tempt me with his dares and taunt me with his words. &lt;br /&gt;I should play along. After all, I asked him to make me bad. I just never thought he’d take his job quite so seriously...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Remington Key:&lt;/b&gt; I left the Navy, scored a billion in tech, got married, and had a baby. I did everything by the book. Happily ever after, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward four years, and I’m alone, raising my daughter, caring for my mother-in-law, and trying to keep my stuff together. How did this happen?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was clearly drunk the night I offered a gorgeous girl in a bar $500 a day to be my live-in nanny. Or maybe it was my dick talking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if I’ve been alone since forever? I’m focused on launching my new business, not bedding the sexy siren who sleeps down the hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least that’s what I keep reminding myself…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruby Banks:&lt;/b&gt; Remington Key is distant, brooding, and incredibly sexy. And when he scoops up his adorable four-year-old daughter Lillie and blows raspberries on her tummy while she squeals with delight, I totally swoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bumping into him at our local pub that night slightly drunk and overly frustrated was a total accident. He needed help, and he offered me a ridiculous salary. I couldn't say no. &lt;i&gt;Right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s given me the chance to pay off my debts and take control of my life. I can't screw up this job. But as bad as I want to be good, I’m not sure I can fake it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way he watches me sends heat sizzling through my insides.&lt;br /&gt;Our hands touch, our eyes meet, and I want to do &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;very naughty things&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;with my new boss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(A STAND-ALONE CONTEMPORARY Romantic Comedy. No cheating; No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Continue Holly and Ben’s story in Stumbling Into Forever&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life would be boring without some chaos thrown in, right? Surprisingly enough, that was Holly and Lord Waffles' specialty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of trouble will they get into next?</description>

  <description>RELEASING MAY 15!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly has spent her whole life as a walking disaster, from running into walls, tripping over invisible objects, and always being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a seemingly normal outing taking her overly opinionated Corgi for a walk resulted in an object to the face, she didn’t think her day could get any worse. The moment she opened her eyes and saw the Adonis standing over her, she knew she’d been wrong. It was about to get a whole lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben’s lived his whole life disobeying his uptight, self-centered, shrew of a mother. Instead of going into the family business, he followed his dreams and opened his veterinarian clinic. One ordinary day at the dog park, and a rogue dog toy later, he found himself captivated by the curvy woman that had a feistiness which set him on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could only get better from here, right? Too bad his mother had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standalone Rom-Com. HEA.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In Alaska, it's always a white Christmas--but the sparks flying between two reunited friends could turn it red-hot...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's one gift Erika Sheraton does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want for Christmas, it's a vacation. Ordered to take time off, the workaholic surgeon reluctantly trades in her scrubs for a ski suit and heads to Wild River, Alaska. Her friend Cassie owns a tour company that offers adventures to fit every visitor. But nothing compares to the adrenaline rush Erika feels on being reunited with Cassie's brother, Reed Reynolds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone is the buttoned-up girl Reed remembers. His sister's best friend has blossomed into a strong, skilled, confident woman. She's exactly what his search-and-rescue team needs--and everything he didn't know he craved. The gulf between his life in Wild River and her big-city career is wide. But it's no match for a desire powerful enough to melt two stubborn hearts...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s all about timing . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ten years&lt;/i&gt;. That’s how long Ashton Andrews spent wondering if she would ever have the family she craved, with a man who was apparently not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Six weeks&lt;/i&gt;. Time spent patiently waiting, silently hoping and endlessly wondering if the decision she’d made to go it alone was the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nine months&lt;/i&gt;. Morning sickness, cravings and that constant need to pee are what Ashton has to look forward to, knowing that numbered are her days of being &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fifteen years, eight days&lt;/i&gt;. An eternity ago were those unforgettable moments spent crushing on her brother’s best friend, yet her mind constantly turns to him—the one who got away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one who might yet be &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s probably about time she found out . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About Time&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary romance featuring 30-something characters who know that life is short and know what they want.</description>

  <description> Meet—or should I say meat—Porter Duke. He serves up a large portion of big beef all alone, but he doesn't want to claim Jillian Murphy by himself. Liam Hogan has what it takes to satisfy the hungriest appetite—and their woman is insatiable.  &lt;br /&gt;When Jill's life is in danger, should she go to the sexy DA and new sheriff who have stolen her heart? Or should she protect her men from the one thing that could destroy them—herself? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remember: With a Vanessa Vale book, one cowboy is never enough. In this smokin' hot series, each heroine gets an extra helping (or two) of Grade-A Beefcake.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Dylan Maxwell is a busy man. His no-nonsense approach to life and business keeps him balanced—and alone. His life is bland—devoid of any kind of sweetness or light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected business trip close to Christmas, however, brings three people into his life he never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An oversharing teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lisping little angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sexy, unassuming woman unlike any he has ever met. Her bossy attitude challenges him, while her green eyes melt the frost around his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They draw out something in him that he has never experienced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Feelings. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they the Christmas miracles he needs—or will he walk away from the sweetest gift he has ever been offered?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 2 in the Insta-Spark Collection - Complete standalone reads with one thing in common - lots of sweetness and a guaranteed HEA. Instant attraction, little angst - love and happiness abounds in this series.</description>

  <description>"Chemistry so electric it flies off the page."--&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt; 4 stars for &lt;em&gt;Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will this cowboy risk for love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colt James is back home on the family ranch, and he's done taking risks. A car accident ruined his shot at a professional hockey career and messed up his love life, and he's not taking a chance on anything that seems too good to be true. Especially not on Chloe Bishop, his nephew's irresistibly charming teacher and the one woman he can't stop thinking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Bishop liked her life the way it was--orderly, structured and safe. Life goes from managed to messy when Colt talks her into helping him coach a hockey team of rowdy eight-year-olds. Being this close to the cowboy she's crushing on is dangerous territory. But when a real enemy threatens Chloe, Colt will do anything to protect her. Even if it means risking himself--and his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A delightful cowboy romance, perfect for readers of Maisey Yates and Carolyn Brown!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cowboys of Creedence series&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br /&gt; Caught Up in a Cowboy (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt; You Had Me at Cowboy (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt; It Started With a Cowboy (Book 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Caught Up in a Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br /&gt; "Funny, complicated, and irresistible. Sometimes a cowboy isn't perfect but you got to love him anyway." --&lt;strong&gt;JODI THOMAS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author&lt;br /&gt; "Full of exquisite heat and passion...an enthralling combination of intense moments, playful banter and great depth of emotion."--&lt;em&gt;Harlequin Junkie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "An appealing story of love rediscovered...enjoy this tender tale."--&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;</description>

I want him, but do I want him bad enough to risk everything, my job included?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will sparks continue to fly between us in and out of the office, or was it all but one night of passion?</description>

  <description>Zero three zero nine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four little numbers … four little words. They might be random and insignificant to anyone else, but they meant something to us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, they meant everything to us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until they were ripped away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the day our lives took a different course. One we had no control over. One that others puppeteered and mangled into a cluster so big, it left us with emotional scars lined with resentment and venom toward each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All because I’m a Montgomery and he’s a Barrett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Trig’s back and he hates me with more hostility and rage than ever … and I’ve learned to do the same. But when the world comes crashing down and the stakes couldn’t be higher, I can’t run and I can’t hide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need the help of the one person whose loathing for me runs deeper than blood and colder than his icy-blue stare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Trig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need him more than I know.</description>

  <description>The last person I expected to see on this tropical island is my ex. Although, since I never actually broke up with her, isn’t she technically still my girlfriend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I’ve got some explaining to do. And groveling. Probably some begging, too. Good thing we’re stuck at this resort together for the next three weeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrine Harper is the only girl I’ve ever wanted, and I won’t let her slip through my fingers again. They call me Aiden the unattainable. Consider me attained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Releasing May 9th, 2019***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unattainable is a standalone romantic comedy in the Night Time Television Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Remember that time you accidentally sexted your in-laws?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. I just did that. Except worse. Now my million social media followers are reading and sharing the rude, smartass message I meant to send privately to my little sister...and I’m officially public enemy number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Beck Ryder. Former boy bander. Underwear model. Fashion mogul. And I just buried my entire leg in my mouth—not just my foot—modern internet style, and publicly insulted my sister’s neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Dempsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also known as the woman of my dreams, who loves geeky TV shows, baseball, and giraffes, who’s just as turned on by food as I am, and who has a huge secret that I didn’t see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's time to grovel and apologize publicly on social media and hope that those same followers who helped start the raging shitstorm will help calm the waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Sarah doesn’t want the spotlight. For very good reasons that I can’t tell you right now and trying to convince her to be my fake girlfriend to fix this mess and make me look like less of a jackass is worse than taking a kick to the nuts by Jackie Chan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I thought modeling underwear made me feel naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to start a relationship in the era of the twitterazzi isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;America’s Geekheart is a rockin’ fun romantic comedy featuring a billionaire fashion mogul who got his start modeling underwear, the geeky girl next door with a secret the size of California, and more superstitions and secrets than you can shake a baseball bat at. It stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mission: &lt;/b&gt;Survive my best friend's wedding, where I must play nice with my ex and his perfect new girlfriend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategy: &lt;/b&gt;Bring the hottest fake boyfriend on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target: &lt;/b&gt;Grady Rock. Master Baker. Dimples. Muscles. The unicorn of fake boyfriends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complication: &lt;/b&gt;Wyatt Morgan. My brother's best friend. My sworn enemy. Military man. Sexy as hell single dad. The man I let into my panties for one night of hot hate sex after my ex dumped me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the man who just scared off that perfect fake boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pretending to be my real boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can roll with this though. What’s the harm in Flirting with the Frenemy if it helps me get the job done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete my mission and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Wyatt kisses me again and I start feeling things I shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about weddings...nothing ever goes as planned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Flirting with the Frenemy is a rollicking fun romantic comedy featuring a single dad military man, an irritatingly attractive blast from his past, pirates, cursing parrots, and a wedding gone wild. It stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Once upon a time, there lived a witch. A kickass, brilliant, dope as hell witch whose magicks inspired fear and envy. Like all classic fairy tales, her story had the usual goodies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Destiny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adventure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Missing souls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfathomable evil, the precarious fate of the entire universe, blah, blah, blah. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But let’s get back to that witch with the awesome hair… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fine, it’s me. I’m the all-powerful witch. And, okay, maybe my story isn’t a classic fairy tale. Not unless I missed the part about Little Red delivering comic books and munchies in her basket and Beauty sleeping off two-for-one margarita night. But I do have a soul mate—my very own Charming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except he’s no prince. He’s a level-headed, by the book, insanely sexy detective. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I’m Stoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 thanks to a dirty talking hero, a filthy-minded heroine, and the hot magicks they create. This story starts where Styx leaves off, so although it is a new couple, it is &lt;i&gt;HIGHLY&lt;/i&gt;(pun totally intended) recommended they be read in order.</description>

  <description>For most women, working for a sexy soccer star would be a dream come true. All except single mom Felicity Shaw. She has no interest in playing personal assistant for a stubborn, injured playboy—no matter how nice his abs are. But with bills piling up and mouths to feed, she can’t say no to the job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s when it gets interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Scott Gillie wants or needs is a persistent and entirely too distracting PA while he’s recuperating in his small hometown. Unfortunately, it’s not up to him. Then Felicity and her son end up temporarily moving in—all thanks to his meddlesome grandmother. Now temptation is right across the hall and it’s driving Scott crazy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His only option is to fight fire with fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never expects Felicity to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Can broken be beautiful?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryker McCabe. Former Special Forces. Survived fifteen months in an Afghan prison, tortured within an inch of his life. His scars—and his fears—keep him alone. Disconnected from the world. From his team. From any hope of redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until he meets &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wren Kane. Hacker extraordinaire. Desperately searching for her brother. When police find his body in a drug den, she knows there's more to his death than an overdose. He'd &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; he was clean. And then, she finds the message he left her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wren's prepared to go it alone. Until she runs right into Ryker. He's the biggest, baddest man she's ever seen. And he's willing to risk his life to fulfill her brother's dying wish. But how can she trust him when he won't let her in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When danger comes for Wren, Ryker jumps into action. No one hurts his little bird. Except maybe him. Because if he can't share his heart, he could lose her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On His Six&lt;/em&gt; is a standalone, slow burn, dark military romance with several potential triggering scenes, including drug use and the brief threat of sexual violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the books in the Away From Keyboard series are standalone romances featuring a different couple, but past couples and characters do occasionally play active roles in future books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>She fled from the depths of hell, her life barely in tact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris is finally living a peaceful life away from all that she fears. She’s ready to come out of hiding and start living again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He walked away from a life no one is supposed to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callan’s been looking over his shoulder for the past two years. There’s a reason they say the mafia is for life. Now, in a new city, and as the guardian of his sister, he has the chance to create a life he can be proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris’s world is rocked off its axis when she meets her new neighbor with turquoise eyes and a protective streak a mile wide. Soon the chemistry between them sparks to life and it’s not long before passion consumes them. But their pasts are never too far away…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When those he loves the most are threatened, will the cost of his sacrifice be his own life?</description>

  <description>How exactly has one good deed landed me in the penalty box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice Knights defenseman Zach Blackburn has come down with the flu, and my BFF—his PR manager—begs me to put my nursing degree to use and get him back to health. Of course she would call in a favor for the most hated man in Harbor City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he’s finally on the mend and I’m sneaking out of his place, everything goes sideways. Paparazzi spot me and pictures, plus accusations that I slept with him, fly faster than a hockey puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, all of Harbor City wants my blood—or to give me a girlie-girl makeover. But then…the team finally wins a game. And now this fickle town wants me with the big jerk twenty-four seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argh. I never slept with him the first time! But no one will listen. Then the grumpy bastard goes and promises to break his no-fan-appearances rule to help raise money for a free health clinic—but only if I’m rink-side at every game. That’s not a deal I can turn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the team keeps winning, and I realize there’s more to him than his bad reputation, suddenly remembering to keep my real hands off my fake date gets harder and harder to do.</description>

  <description>Two neighbors—strangers—with one thing in common—they share a fence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is that the only thing they share?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Fraser lives a solitary life, never letting anyone get too close. It’s safer that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kourtney Whyte hides from the world and behind her work, too afraid to really live her life to the fullest. Rejection is what she knows best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one night, the sound of her soft voice and the tantalizing aroma of her evening meal, prove too enticing for Nathan to ignore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins their unconventional relationship—talking, learning, texting, and gradually opening up to one another, all over the fence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the day Nathan braves the high fence to protect Kourtney from her past, and changes everything forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they move forward together, without the buffer of the fence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will their pasts prove to be too much of a barrier?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I didn’t mean to kidnap the groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn't take much time to plan it. It was more of a spur of the moment kidnapping. Does that count?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute, the town’s bad boy is standing at the altar about to marry the world’s most evil kindergarten teacher. The next, he’s passed out in my Vespa sidecar with his bride hot on our tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn't have a choice! I couldn't stand by and watch Jace O’Dell be blackmailed into a loveless marriage. And besides, what’s a little kidnapping between friends? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe we’re not just friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe I can’t quit thinking about that night at his bar when he closed up early and had me on the rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe this crazy stunt is going to blow up in both of our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does, I’m blaming the moonshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the only thing I’m hammered on when it comes to Jace is love—straight up, no chaser.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even one-night stands deserve a second chance in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken’s novel of sporting desire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can a virgin do when she’s ditched at the altar? Seattle heiress Mackenzie Dupont is treating herself to a single-girl honeymoon in Mexico and a desire to relinquish her innocence to a gorgeous one-night stand. Fake names. True pleasure. But when she wakes up alone, Mackenzie realizes just how much anger is left in her broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffering a tragic personal loss, pro soccer player Slade Rodriguez has his reasons for vanishing without a goodbye. Right or wrong, he’s blaming the beautiful and infuriating stranger he never wants to see again. They’re both in for a shock when Mackenzie shows up as his new personal assistant. And they both have a lot to learn about each other. Because they share more than they could possibly know, including a common enemy who’s playing his own games. And he’s not afraid to get dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s only one way Mackenzie and Slade can win: to trust in each other and to stop hiding from the lies they’ve told, the secrets they’ve kept, the mistakes they’ve made, and the attraction that still burns between them.</description>

  <description>He’s an Enigma, like an unsolved mystery or a puzzle missing the final piece. How did he become this way? Well, that’s the part that gets complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kol - &lt;br /&gt;I’m a foster kid raised by greed and child abuse. I fought my way out of the system, literally. My bloody knuckles and bruised ribs have made me the man I am today: one angry, distrusting a$$hole. &lt;br /&gt;I keep my thoughts and my words to myself, and my women to the barest of minimums. Don’t get me wrong. I could have any woman I wanted, but I don’t want just any of them. &lt;br /&gt;I want her. Jade. She looks like Barbie but fights like Brutus.&lt;br /&gt;She drives me crazy with her sassy mouth and constant want to discuss my “feelings”.&lt;br /&gt;That damn stubborn streak of hers is going to be the end of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jade – &lt;br /&gt;I’m a foster system reject, but I refuse to let it hold me back. I know what I want in life and how to get it, but some men think a female fighter is a distraction to the real MMA fighting that men do. I’m not going to let anyone get in the way of living my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;So when I have to beat a fighter just to join an exclusive MMA training center, I choose him. The Enigma. One trip and I fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;I see the lover I need inside the fighter I want, but his past keeps his heart caged and untrusting.&lt;br /&gt;When life starts to crumble down around us, a cowardly shadow of the man I admire takes over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Kol and Jade fight to keep their love alive? Or does one slip of the tongue break their trust forever? What happens when the fight is over, but no one wins?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;“I wasn’t ready for this. Hannah deserved a man who was whole, not a broken shell. But I couldn’t resist her. Couldn’t resist this. It felt too good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And would that be so bad? To have something that felt good for once?”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Leo Miles, and I’m not a hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home broken—wounded and scarred. It’s been five years, and I haven’t left my family’s land. Not once. It’s not much of a life, but with the way I look now, I prefer to stay hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reprieve is her voice. I put on my headset, log in to my game, and she’s there. We talk while we play, sharing everything but our personal details. She’s my best friend—my happy place—even though I don’t know her real name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, I hear a voice I recognize. She’s here, at my family’s winery. Meeting Hannah Tate in person rocks my world. And discovering she’s in trouble—serious trouble—changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;Hannah is my every fantasy come true. And this badass gamer girl is determined to break through my defenses. But between the mess that is my life, and the threats to my family’s safety, I can’t be anyone’s hero, least of all hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe we both need saving.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was my princess.&lt;br /&gt;I was her psycho.&lt;br /&gt;Two worlds colliding with a BOOM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a sh*tstorm brewing. Whispers. Rumbles. A rot—fueled by greed and protected by corruption—that’d seeped like sewage, eating away at everything it touched. The only people I trusted were my brother by blood, my brothers by patch, and the crazy Irish-Scottish bastard I did jobs for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was why, when the hot-as-hell blonde started trailing my brothers and me, I had to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Ophelia Kline was working with the enemy—playing me with lies from that damn mouth. Or maybe she was innocent—caught in the spread of toxic rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, she was &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;. And when push came to glock-in-the-face, I wouldn’t let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because all good relationships start with a BOOM and a little kidnapping… right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~&lt;br /&gt;This is a Happily Ever Alpha novel featuring crossover from the Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It can be read as a standalone, but it's recommended you read Until Nox first since a certain accented someone shows up often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 due to alllll the good things: Adult language. Adult situations. Biker hotties who work in the gray. And an OTT hero who knows what he wants when he gets hit by the BOOM.</description>

  <description>I never thought I’d fall for an older man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s smart. Sexy. Irresistible. Everything I’ve ever wanted, but I can't have him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s broken. Guarded. He'll never give me what I need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I still want him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am going to show him how to live again... and how to love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that was the plan.</description>

  <description>The first time I met Fitz or to most of the world Duke Fitzegerald Heraldo Belleville, I punched him in the throat. &lt;br /&gt;I was actually aiming for his chin, but he was a few years older, clearly not wiser, but at least taller. &lt;br /&gt;He started wheezing on his candy cane. &lt;br /&gt;And well, the rest is history. &lt;br /&gt;Hate replaced what could have been friendship, and for the rest of my teen years, I watched him flirt with every single breathing female. &lt;br /&gt;I hated him. &lt;br /&gt;Plotted his death with a smile on my face. &lt;br /&gt;And knew that my first decree as Queen would be to chop off his head. &lt;br /&gt;Except now that I'm finally old enough to inherit the title, there's one tiny little slip-up. &lt;br /&gt;I need a man by my side. &lt;br /&gt;The problem? &lt;br /&gt;I may have accidentally scared them all away. &lt;br /&gt;I have no options. &lt;br /&gt;Until the devil rings my doorbell with a wicked grin on his face and revenge dancing like sugarplums in his gaze. &lt;br /&gt;I hate that I need him. &lt;br /&gt;It's a serious problem. &lt;br /&gt;We have twelve days before we say I do. &lt;br /&gt;I just pray we survive without killing each other first.</description>

  <description>Tequila: a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant and, in Mary’s case, a truth serum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took one night. &lt;br /&gt;No, it took one dinner, a bevy of cocktails, and a woman who’s been skirting me for months. Then, everything changed. Because the tequila did what it does best, Mary’s words flowed faster than the magic liquid she was shooting with salt and lime. &lt;br /&gt;Mary had demons—ones she thought were buried. She thought wrong. &lt;br /&gt;She can’t hide from her past or from me. Not anymore. &lt;br /&gt;I’m Evan Hargrove and I’ll turn the world red before I let anything happen to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a Killers Series Crossover Novella written for the Happily Ever Alpha World of NYT Bestselling Author, Aurora Rose Reynolds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book contains naughty words and sexy bits. If you aren’t eighteen, step away from the purchase button, turn around, and walk away. We’ll pretend this never happened and I won’t tell your parents. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tyler Meyer is totally straight. But then the hot woman he’s hooking up with sticks her finger where she shouldn’t, and suddenly he’s not so sure… Straight guys can like that sort of thing too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except things get confusing–and frustrating–when fingers and toys aren’t quite enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Nick Hardaway, Tyler’s best friend. What’s a little fun between bros, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: This novella contains explicit MM content, feminization, and derogatory dirty talk. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes&lt;i&gt; BATTLE OF THE BULGE,&lt;/i&gt; Book Four of the OHellNO Series. (A Standalone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Chicks can’t be bodyguards. Especially hot chicks.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY NAME IS MITCH HOFER. I’m a world-famous swimmer from Australia, best known for three things: my gold medals, my looks, and filling out a swimsuit with my…eh-hem—bulky equipment. Let’s just say there’s a reason my nickname is “the Bulge.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond the fame, sponsors, and glory, there’s more to me than people know, including one hell of a mess I’ve gotten mixed up in. Life-or-death stuff, so bring in the professionals. Just don’t give me a chick bodyguard. Especially a young hot one who distracts me at every turn and hates my guts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY NAME IS ABI CARTER, and I hate Mitch Hofer. Yeah, he might be the sexiest champion swimmer in the world, but I’d give this guy a gold medal for being a first-class jerk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my boss has given me a choice—guard Mitch or get another job. And I really need the money. I can be professional, but if Mitch says “chicks can’t be bodyguards” one more time, I just might strangle him myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, something about the way Mitch keeps looking at me makes me think there’s more to his story. It’s almost as if he’s trying to drive me away. But why?</description>

  <description>After divorcing the woman he’d been with since he was seventeen, Nick Fuller is starting over. He owns the restaurant of his dreams and he’s determined to meet new people, find new passions, and experience life to its fullest. Easier said than done—that is until he meets his new neighbor, Bryce Tanner…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryce is all about a good time. He plans to show Nick how it’s done, help him meet a few women, and enjoy the gift of the single life he’s been given. But things don’t go as planned, and soon they realize they’d rather be together than with anyone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither man has ever wanted another guy, but there’s a connection between them from the start—a spark they can’t deny. They find themselves navigating an unfamiliar new world and dealing with unforeseen obstacles. Physical desire isn’t enough, and now Nick and Bryce are at a crossroads. They have to decide which way to go—the easy path they’ve always followed, or the one that's determined to trip them up at every turn.</description>

  <description>Allie Saunders has a dirty secret. Make that two fantastically filthy secrets. Beau Colton and Van Mitchell. The leading stars of her X-rated fantasies also happen to be her brother’s best friends. Hello, big fat hairy complication. It’s no mystery why her unrequited crushes insist on keeping her at arm’s length, but it doesn’t stop her from wishing for the impossible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she discovers &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; dirty secret, the once forbidden is suddenly a tantalizing temptation and the key that could turn her dreams into a reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition to being co-owners of a boxing gym, Van and Beau share mutual tastes outside of the ring—they’re both Doms. That’s partly the reason for their unbreakable Bro Code where Allie is concerned. She’s far too sweet and innocent for the edgy games they enjoy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or so they thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their assumption—and willpower—is about to be tested. Big time. All because of an annual Sub-For-A-Night charity event, and the irresistible, thoroughly off-limits woman who just stepped onto the auction block...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: This wickedly hot MMF ménage contains two deliciously dirty boxers, a not-so-innocent dirty-talking heroine, dirty rope tricks, and dirty ways to break a sweat. Who says exercise can’t be fun?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Crystal Cove Reminds You Of Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Valentine doesn't want to remember; not the cute little town, his forgone friends or the girl he's done everything to forget. A lovely flower when he knew her a decade before, she's bloomed into a stunning woman. A mother, a fighter and the sexiest thing he's ever seen. A decade apart, and all the trying hasn't done much to erase his feelings for her. Now, she's the only thing that makes him want to remember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Kirkpatrick might be tough-but she doesn't want to be. Once the town sweetheart, her fairytale life fell apart piece by piece. Left with nothing but her precious twins and lots of bad memories, romance is the last thing she's thinking about. Enter Theo-her secret high school crush-in town just long enough to make Daisy wonder if her fairytale is still coming true.</description>

  <description>When a rockstar and a single mom become roommates, delicious sparks are bound to fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockstar Hudson Mitchell is over the glitz and spotlight of the music industry. Desperate for a break from the fast-paced life of fame, he retreats to the one place that has always been home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooksville, California. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the same place where Charlie has taken refuge, trying to build a life for herself and her young daughter. The quiet, small-town atmosphere and her new bakery venture are exactly what she needs to pick up the pieces of her shattered past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they spend more time together, neither of them is prepared for the effect Charlie has on Hudson, and how important she would become for his career.</description>

  <description>Party girl Jade Roberts loves seeing her friends having fun. That’s the reason she challenged them to the bet that set them all off on wild adventures and helped them find true love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing her friends so happy, Jade starts to think she might be missing something. But when she catches sight of the sexy guy stepping out on the beach at her summer kick off party, she begins to hope she’s found her own happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it turns out that guy is Logan Murphy, a soldier home for R&amp;amp;R, not to mention her best friend’s older brother, she second-guesses her feelings. Right up to the moment when the friendship she and Logan always shared explodes into something she never expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will their night together be her dirty little secret or the beginning of a lifetime of love?</description>

  <description>Outgoing and ambitious, Paige Jordan has firm ideas about what success looks like. That’s the reason she stays in medical school despite not having the slightest bit of passion for her chosen career. She can’t admit, even to herself, that becoming a doctor might be all wrong for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And speaking of all wrong for her… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rock star Jared Sloane is a temptation she can’t quite resist. But he’s her dirty little secret. Even her closest friends don’t know she’s hooking up with him every time he hits town. The passion she finds with him almost makes up for what’s missing in the rest of her life. But when Jared suggests she spend her spring break on tour with his band, Paige might find it’s more than just passion she can’t live without… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>No more Miss Nice Girl… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Katelyn Murphy has always done exactly what’s expected of her and put everyone else’s needs before her own. But what did that get her? A family that’s falling apart, a boss who takes credit for her work, and no love life to speak of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when her friends make a bet to see who can have the wildest adventure, she decides it’s the perfect excuse to break out of her shell. And she knows exactly who can help bring out her naughty side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hunter Lawson was the bad boy next door--her brother’s best friend, the boy she crushed on through her teen years, the guy her mother warned her about. Always the good girl, she never did more than stare a little too long when she saw him riding off on his motorcycle. But a lot can change when a good girl gets snowed in with a biker. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When introvert Emma Glover makes a bet with her friends to see who can have the wildest adventure by New Year’s, she has no intention of winning. She might spend her days writing about sex for her syndicated news column, but her nights are all about takeout and flannel pajamas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her friend challenges her to live out one of the sexual escapades she writes about, Emma knows she won’t be able to follow through. But that’s before she lays eyes on a sexy stranger across a crowded hotel lobby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can’t help but hope he’s interested in more than one night, but when she finds out her gorgeous one night stand is actually billionaire media mogul Nate Wilder, her hopes die a fast death. There’s no way her Christmas wish will come true. Or is there?</description>

  <description>It's been ten years since Parker Drew and Gus Duke have seen each other, but it's like no time has passed. They were hot and heavy back then and the spark's still there now. But they're no longer fumbling kids and they know what they want... what they need. For Parker, that's giving up control to more than one guy.&lt;br /&gt;Gus is more than willing to deliver because he wants to share a woman with Kemp and Poe. One look and he knows that's Parker. All three big cowboys are going to give her everything she ever imagined... times three. Oh, she'll get so much more than just the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: With a Vanessa Vale book, one cowboy is never enough. In this smokin' hot series, each heroine gets an extra helping (or two) of Grade-A Beefcake.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Terri Osburn comes a bittersweet romance about discovering the past, if only to finally let it go.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Liza Teller’s new book is something of a mystery. She’s been hired to ghostwrite the memoir of Ray Wallis, an elderly stranger eager to share a very personal and surprising life story. The moment Liza arrives on beautiful Haven Island off the South Carolina coast, she has to ask: Out of all the semi-successful writers with stalled careers in the world, why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall James, the dedicated ex-military man in Ray’s employ, has the same question. Why is this New Yorker in a frilly blue dress so important to Ray? But as protective and suspicious as he is, Kendall can’t help falling for the tempting outsider. And he isn’t falling alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ray’s life story unfolds, Liza and Kendall’s chemistry ignites. And all of it could be explosive. On an island this small, Liza soon discovers that there isn’t much room to hide—from the secrets of Ray’s past or from her desire for a man unwilling to give her the one thing she truly wants.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ask Me to Stay, by Terri Osburn, is the third book I’ve read by this author. I have also read a short story she did for an anthology. This one has a different feel to it than the others I’ve read which is a good thing. It keeps things interesting. I would categorize this as a slow burn romance wi...]]>

  <description>What do you do when your career is stagnant and one of the biggest businessmen in the city offers you the opportunity of a lifetime? To plan a New Year’s Eve party for thousands of his employees. On too short of notice. With no plan. With an almost assured chance of failure? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you take it, of course. Or at least, that is what Sage Walters decides to do, sure that if she could pull it off, this would be the job that would catapult her career to a whole new level that doesn’t involve one gender reveal party after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of course, she’d have to not only contend with the impossibility of pulling off the event on such short of notice, but the overbearing, micromanaging, condescending CEO of Calgary Industries - Grant Calgary himself, their constant bickering, and the completely irrational, unprofessional - yet undeniable - chemistry between them…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is a short, light, but sexy New Year’s Eve novella</description>

But when she stumbles into a kilted Highlander with a killer accent, Cassie decides that taking one night off from work and spending it with a sexy Scot couldn’t hurt. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan Reid has built a career on his charm, hosting a series of off-the-wall hijinks on the Web. But when the Scottish prankster meets the all-American, equal parts intelligent and irresistible Cassie, Logan realizes that one night of fun won’t be enough. Could it be that this career-focused, commitment-phobic couple is finally ready to take a chance at true and lasting love?</description>

  <description>Stephine Willis no longer believed in happily ever after. At least not for herself. &lt;br /&gt;Max Vicente was determined to change her mind. &lt;br /&gt;After all, some fairy tales really do come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 20k word novella is part of the Alluring series but can be read as a standalone. ***Beware*** This is insta-love with an OTT nod to Cinderella. It's meant to be slightly unbelievable but 100% fun. Due to sex and language, it is recommended for persons over 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s bossy, moody, and overprotective.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also a pro athlete who needs to focus on winning games and staying out of the headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m fiercely independent and need a man like I need a second period each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when our worlds collide, I never expected him to be the one to jump in and save me. Especially not when my roommate disappears, leaving me with her baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m clueless about babies—and it shows. Good thing Alexei isn’t. With six nieces and nephews and an apparent hero complex, the dude is both sexy and more than capable. It’s a combination that makes it easy to forget we’re just playing house.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s bossy, arrogant, and so ridiculously hot he should come with a warning label and a pair of flame retardant coveralls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also the boy who broke my heart when we were in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to move in next door to Ryan O’Dell the way I want to be the virgin gamer geek suddenly in charge of running my sister’s sex toy factory. Too bad both are written in my stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I’m the world’s oldest virgin code-writing nerd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s the world’s hottest firefighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even though he intimidates the heck out of me, I can’t seem to control my libido when he’s around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is my dignity? My self-respect? My panties?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously…. Have you seen them? Anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they’re hiding in his bedroom. With my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know. I’m hosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hosed&lt;/i&gt; is a steamy, fun romantic comedy between a firefighter and the virgin nerd next door, complete with a pet raccoon, scandalous gossip, and dildo football. (No, really.) This romance has no cheating or cliffhangers, and ends with a banging hot happily ever after.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Originally published in the HOT ON ICE hockey anthology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hotshot hockey center Finn Donnelly wants nothing more than to take The Cup to his best friend’s grave after the Rage’s big win. The problem is, that also means returning to his hometown and seeing January Sinclair, a.k.a., the woman he left behind. She might be as beautiful and fiery as ever, but Finn’s ghosts belong in the past. As soon as he’s done at the cemetery, he’s on the first flight out of Remington—for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January has never forgotten Finn, or the impulsive kiss that ruined their friendship seven years ago. But he left town without a word, and now she’s got a fire house to run and a huge fundraiser on the horizon. When Finn gets stuck in town longer than expected, January discovers the sexy hockey player isn’t all that he seems—yet still everything she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Finn’s ghosts won’t let go so easily. Will he and January learn to build new trust? Or will their past keep them from falling in deep…</description>

  <description> This year, rocking the office holiday party has taken on a whole new meaning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All receptionist Wendy Stanton wants for Christmas is a chance for a relationship with her sexy, sweet, dominant boss, Des. When that chance comes, she gets a whole lot more from the bargain than she’d anticipated—mainly a few steamy, mind-blowing encounters that include her other equally sexy boss, Cole Warner. Her body enjoys every bit of their attention, but her heart still wants more. She wants Des outside of the boardroom and the bedroom and in her life for good. But he’s hiding secrets and she’s hiding her feelings, and soon they’re drifting farther apart instead of growing closer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if anything can get them to come together, it’s Christmas Eve…  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author’s note: In this book, sex and candy is not a euphemism. And some of the ornaments from the tree have more than one use...just sayin'. Oh, and boys touch in this story. Often. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author’s note part deux: Jingle Ball was originally published by Cari Quinn in 2012. It has been re-edited and includes an epilogue.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s all it takes for me to know I wanted Ava for more than one night. She takes a single look at me and only sees a player. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young, single mom doesn’t give her trust easily. Convincing her I want more than a one night stand is the best thing I’ve ever done until it all crashes down around me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I’m framed for crimes I didn’t commit, I fight to prove my innocence and battle to convince Ava and her daughter to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the stakes rise, will I be able to prove my vow of devotion?</description>

  <description>I’ve been obsessed with Ruby since the day I saw her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m rough, rugged, and damaged. Ever since I got out of the Marines, all I’ve wanted is to be left alone on my mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, she walked into my bar, ordered a cheeseburger and a cherry coke, and before she took a single bite I was in love. Smitten. Completely obsessed with this beautiful, innocent girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’m not the only one who’s noticed her. My bar’s also the meeting spot for the Iron Diablos MC -- and I’m the only man around here who’ll stand up to them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’ll do anything to protect Ruby and make her mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything.</description>

      <![CDATA[Her Obsessed Mountain Man is the first book I have read by Parker Grey. I admit I have a slight weakness for mountain men and I couldn’t resist grabbing this. And I’m so glad I did.

      <![CDATA[I wrote this review last night, right after finishing the book. But I wasn't happy with it. I don't feel like I properly conveyed my love of this author. But after leaving it over night and re-reading it, I'm going to leave it alone, since they were my thoughts right after the final page. Just kn...]]>

  <description>Cold days. Steamy nights. It must be the holidays in the Highlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Emery MacTaggart, and I want to tell you a story. It's about two people who believed nothing could save their love. But they're wrong, and I've resolved to prove it. They are my family now, and I fight for the ones I love — even if it means meddling in their affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Gavin Douglas lusted for Jamie MacTaggart from the minute he met the sweet Scot eighteen months ago and fell in love in the next minute. But when he tries to propose.... Well, things don't go as planned. His stupid mouth won't let him speak the right words. He offers her a credit card instead of a ring, and before he can make it right, she dumps him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie loves Gavin, but she's had enough. After more than a year of intercontinental romance, she needs a commitment, not a bloody frequent-flyer credit card. Then, her American sister-in-law, Emery, suggests an alternative plan. Make Gavin rue the day he hurt Jamie by making him want her so badly he can't see straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin can't resist Jamie's seduction, but hot sex won't earn back her trust. Spurred by Emery's advice, he'll battle Jamie's obnoxious ex-fiancé and his own inner demons. He'll even make peace with Jamie's overprotective brothers — if the intimidating Rory will cooperate. As the two men engage in a battle of wills and muscles, Gavin vows to win back everything he wants by Christmas. If he survives that long...</description>

This is my first book by Anna but surprisingly enough, I already have at lease a couple of the previous books in this series. I just haven’t read them yet.
