2013-12-14 19:17:15,"@LibertyArmsMN @bwinger @CSGV  it only maters what they think. If you don't agree then they say ""well that's just crazy"""
2013-12-14 19:04:54,@Parineca @CSGV  that's why education is extremely important.
2013-12-14 18:54:23,@CSGV fact guns r not allowed to b owned in DC Yet u have the highest rate of crime n drugs.Ur regulated laws obviously aren't working out
2013-12-14 18:35:11,@CSGV well that's just crazy labeling people for voicing their opinion you label them with #and including them as kid killers. #Slanderer
2013-12-14 18:33:28,@CSGV well i refuse to be a minion to the government. I have the right to protect my family in my own home.
2013-12-14 18:25:22,@TLMORUSA @CSGV @Parineca those studies are how old?
2013-12-14 18:18:36,@bwinger @CSGV  just what we need the government being another Hitler.
2013-12-14 18:15:46,@bwinger @CSGV I'm not defending @CSGV I THINK IT IS IDIOCY TO TAKE AWAY AMERICANS RIGHTS. THIS IS NOT A DICTATORSHIP.
2013-12-14 18:13:03,@bwinger @CSGV you have as many laws as you want the criminals do not care. Y take away others rights because of criminals
2013-12-14 18:10:49,@CSGV @bwinger  pools are regulated by the health department for proper chemicals etc. not children dying. Our to keep then from drowning.
2013-12-14 18:08:29,@TLMORUSA @CSGV @Parineca  if you have your gun against an intruder you're safer as well as your loved ones.
2013-12-14 18:05:42,@bwinger @CSGV they need to be more worried about the illegal guns and criminals than the registered hand gun owners.
2013-12-14 18:03:15,@CSGV your facts are not involving everyone and every situation.
2013-12-14 18:01:02,"@CSGV no i did not. Fantasy is make believe. Reality if a criminal intends on harming me, my family in my home i will shoot them."
2013-12-14 17:59:09,@CSGV @Parineca if someone broke in my house again i will shot them. That's reality
2013-12-14 17:53:14,@SPeteDave @CSGV @Parineca  i understand the law fully.
2013-12-14 17:51:34,@CSGV But here you are voicing your opinion and yet want everyone to follow. What about others who don't live in d.c.
2013-12-14 17:50:11,"@CSGV i grew up with guns all around me, my cousins, family. We never killed our selves or others. We are not weak minded either."
2013-12-14 17:46:18,@CSGV  protecting my children from an intruder. My kids lives are more important than your statistics.#AMothersRight
2013-12-14 17:44:58,@CSGV fact a man broke n my house n told the cops he wished i would've shot him instead i grabbed a hammer. Is that real enough.
2013-12-14 17:40:26,@CSGV @Parineca  just because someone speaks up for their rights you want to assume and # ie label them with killing sprees. Grow up
2013-12-14 17:38:22,@CSGV @Parineca your executive director.
2013-12-14 17:37:54,@CSGV you have to include peoples minds and state of their minds when owning a fun as. well
2013-12-14 17:36:04,@CSGV @Parineca wtf you included my name with a # that harmed children. I would never do anything to harm a child. Ask Josh.
2013-12-14 17:32:18,@CSGV lol not all people think the same. So no it did not include someone like myself.
2013-12-14 17:30:36,@CSGV i have no killing fantasies. Far from it. But i will protect me and mine at any cost from a criminal. I have that right.
2013-12-14 17:28:32,@CSGV well their findings didn't include people like me. #AmericanRights did they get their statistics from up there or down south
2013-12-14 17:23:08,"@CSGV @Parineca  i can guarantee you if someone broke in my house, they would wish I had a gun by the time I'm done with them."
2013-12-14 17:20:50,@CSGV @Parineca  not in my house. It is called #education on guns.
2013-12-14 17:17:40,@CSGV @Parineca @crazytrkdriver2 @Salon  How are they safer? #Explain
