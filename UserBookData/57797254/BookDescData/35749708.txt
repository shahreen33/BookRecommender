Managing Up is a skill that will help you develop strong relationships, which will increase cooperation, collaboration, and understanding between those who have different power levels and perspectives. It's not about brown nosing, schmoozing, or sucking up. It's about developing robust relationships with the people who have enormous influence over your career. Being able to effectively manage up is good for you, good for your boss, and good for your organization. Self-awareness is also a hallmark of success, and Managing Up will teach readers about themselves, too. One of the most effective insights is to understand your own personality and your boss's to see how you can adapt yours to theirs. In Managing Up, you will learn strategies to quickly assess who you are, and who your boss is, and then understand where and how you can align to move forward. (This works for spouses and partners, too.)
