 Two best friends. Eight pub quizzes. One shot at love...  There are some people who seem like they have all the answers in life. Clarrie Midwinter isn't one of them. At the age of 26, tomboy Clarrie is still struggling to become a 'proper' grown-up. She's eternally strapped for cash, she hasn't had a date in nearly a year and her attempts to quit smoking tend to take a nosedive after the second pint. Most annoyingly of all, her ladykiller best friend Simon just won't stop asking her out. The only thing keeping her sane is her pub quiz team, the Mighty Morphin Flower Arrangers. But when Simon bets her a date their team will win the quiz league, Clarrie is forced to confront what she really wants out of life â€“ and love. Is it finally time for her to grow up? 
  Gloriously irreverent, badly behaved romantic comedy from the author of Meet Me at the Lighthouse.
