  «Don't overthink it.»
Ally and Lisa are your typical couple - they play videogames, go on dates, and indulge in extreme BDSM sex while awkwardly avoiding discussing their deeper feeling and desires. Okay, maybe the last bit isn't so typical. Regardless, as the two move further away from the realm of friendship and deeper into the intoxicating world of S&amp;M, the bonds between them grow even tighter, but a secret from Ally's past threatens to tear them further apart.At the heat of every relationship lies unspoken truths, but for Ally and Lisa, the lines between love and lust, friendship and heartache, constantly blur. In a romance defined by power, telling the truth can be just as risky as keeping secrets.Equal parts funny, sexy, and heart-wrenching, Sunstone Vol. 2 continues Stjepan Šejić's creator-owned smash hit.
