The calm before the storm...I was living a quiet, somewhat boring life. Safe and comfortable. Until a winter storm came. The wind rustled in warning, telling me to get out of its path.But I didn’t.I never stood a chance.A series of weather and road mishaps leaves me trapped in the middle of a blizzard with a complete stranger. In the back of a pickup truck. For forty-eight freakin’ hours.A stranger with long hair, tattoos, and rippling with muscle. A stranger with an insanely sexy voice and a smile that turned my insides to jelly. A stranger who held me in his arms, calmed me, and then set a fire in me that I couldn’t put out.Storm lives up to his name. Beautiful. Dangerously inviting. Tumultuous. Dark. A clash of hot and cold.He’s used to getting everything he wants.And now he wants me.Some people chase storms for the beautiful thrill. What happens when the storm chases you?
