My Savior… Or My Ruin?  One night, and my entire life went up in flames. All because of him. Jafar. As my world burned down around me, he offered me a choice. Walk away with nothing but my freedom… Or rise to his challenge and win my fortune back.  I bargained.  I lost.  Now Jafar owns me, and even as my mind rails against his rules, my body loves the punishments he deals out when I break them.  But a gilded cage is still a prison, I’ll do anything to obtain my freedom.  Even betray the man I’m falling for.
