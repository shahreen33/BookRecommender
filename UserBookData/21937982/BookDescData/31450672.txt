When Enna's brother Leifer starts setting fires--without a spark, without flint--something seems wrong. Enna can't decide if she wants the power for herself, or if it should be extinguished forever. And when Bayern goes to war, that choice becomes unbearable as her friendships are tested and sense of self is nearly lost in the fires she creates. Enna and her best friend, Isi, must search of a cure for the war around them--and for the wars within themselves.
