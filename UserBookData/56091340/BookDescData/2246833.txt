Time to gird the loins and pucker up.Blimey O'Reilly's trousers! Three maybe-boyfriends is a lot for any girl to handle--red-bottomed or not. What with Robbie the Sex God back from Kiwi-a-gogo land wanting to "get coffee" and whatsit, Masimo the Luuurve God saying things like ""Ciao," Georgia, see you later" (the good see-you-later or the bad see-you-later ), and her mate Dave the Laugh snogging her in a pond, it's enough to make any girl mad.Good thing she has the ace gang to keep her sane. Ish.But now that she has tearfully eschewed Robbie the Sex God with a firm hand, Georgia is left with two potential snoggees to choose from, and it's high time she left the cakeshop of love for good. This time with a gorgey Italian cakey. Or a nip-libbling Dave the Tart. But certainly not both. Maybe.
