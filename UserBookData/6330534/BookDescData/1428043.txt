In this relentlessly gripping psychological thriller, Johnny Depp plays Spencer Armacost, an astronaut sent on a space shuttle mission with his partner, Captain Alex Streck. While in space, an accident occurs that cuts all contact between the men and earth for two minutes. Both men return from the trip with no memory of those crucial minutes, and soon thereafter Streck mysteriously dies. Little by little, Spencer's wife Jillian, pregnant with twins, begins to suspect that something happened on the mission during those two minutes...something that changed Spencer into something other than the man she loves...something that might mean the end of us all...
