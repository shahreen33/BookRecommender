He was five seconds away from the incredible, from the awesome; from a beauty he would remember all of his life. Fourteen-year-old Kent Palmer was also five seconds away from a decision which would change his summer and his life. It began when Kent caught an albino bluefish, the first albino ever seen, as he was fishing with his father. Faced with an instantaneous decision, he chose to free the fish rather than turn it over for scientific investigation. His action led to a summer job working on an oceanographic laboratory's research boat, a confrontation with sensationalistic newsmen and exploiters who wished to make money off his discovery, and a chance to appear on a national television program to argue against the offering of a reward for the capture of "his fish." THE ALBINO BLUE is a story abounding in good nature, lore and marine biology. Yet it is also a story of a young man whose relationship with his father and the people he meets helps him bridge the gap between boyhood and manhood.
