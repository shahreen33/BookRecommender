Since Georgia's been dating the yummy scrumboes Sex God, Robbie, her glossy lips are always at the ready, and her "red-bottomosity" is kept under wraps. Along with Naomi the Sex Kitten's new litter (thank you, Angus), Robbie's announcement that his band will be traveling to Hamburger-a-gogo land (Georgia can only hope to go with), and a class trip to France, Georgia is one camper in a state of teenage splendiosity. The small trouble is, Georgia also wonders if Dave the Laugh might still be the guy for her, and when Robbie gives a surprise-ending twist to his travel plans, she gets a "weird feeling of reliefosity" that makes her wonder if she must venture out and bravely use her "red bottom wisely."Another first-rate entry in the diary tales of Georgia, Nuddy-Pants will keep fans panting for more. While Rennison hasn't provided any earth-shattering events in her heroine's life, this book shows Georgia's true nuddy-pants personality to be just as funny as ever. With plenty of juicy hints at what's to come, this laugh-out-loud read is one not to miss. Shana Taylor
