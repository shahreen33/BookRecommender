Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She's pretty. She does her job well. But she has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds. That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.Sookie's investigation into what's going on leads her into a battle between witches, vampires and werewolves. But there could be even greater danger - to Sookie's heart - because the kinder, gentler Eric is very hard to resist.
