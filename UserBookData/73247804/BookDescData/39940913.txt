A beautiful guide for learning to love ourselves, from the author of the internationally bestselling The Things You Can See Only When You Slow DownNo one is perfect. But that doesn't stop us from imagining ourselves smarter, funnier, richer, or thinner, and how much happier we would then be.Love for Imperfect Things, by the bestselling Korean monk, Haemin Sunim, shows how the path to happiness and peace of mind includes not only strong relationships with others, but also letting go of worries about ourselves. Packed with his typical spiritual wisdom, Sunim teaches us to embrace our flaws rather than trying to overcome them, and demonstrates that love has very little to do with perfection.With chapters on self-compassion, relationships, empathy, courage, family, healing, our true nature, and acceptance, as well as beautiful full-colour illustrations, Love for Imperfect Things is a much-needed guide for learning to love ourselves - imperfections and all.'Universal truths, beautifully expressed, lovingly illustrated . . . this is a book to keep close at hand' - Mark Williams, co-author of 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World', on 'The Things You Can See''A remarkable gift, a compendium of practical wisdom.
