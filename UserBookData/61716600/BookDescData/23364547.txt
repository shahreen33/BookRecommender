Chronicles of the Unexplained presents a lifetime of true paranormal experiences. The stories are from a broad range of individuals, many of whom would be the last people you would expect to be willing to communicate with anyone on such subjects. The true tales are interspersed with the story of the author's own battle with a not-so-hospitable entity and the unforeseen circumstances that were associated with the completion of this book.
