Boyhood meets The Sun Is Also a Star in this unconventional love story by award-winning author Meredith Russo!Two kids, Morgan and Eric, are bonded for life after being born on the same day at the same time. We meet them once a year on their shared birthday as they grow and change: as Eric figures out who he is and how he fits into the world, and as Morgan makes the difficult choice to live as her true self. Over the years, they will drift apart, come together, fight, make up, and break upâ€”and ultimately, realize how inextricably they are a part of each other.
