The new collection of stories from the Orange Prize-winning author of 'Purple Hibiscus' and 'Half of a Yellow Sun'.The first work from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie since her bestselling, prize-winning and phenomenally successful Richard and Judy pick 'Half of a Yellow Sun'. Told with the vividness and insight that make her novels exceptional, these are stories of universal conflicts - between culture, gender, responsibility and identity.In 'A Private Experience,' a medical student hides from a violent riot with a poor Muslim woman whose dignity and faith force her to confront the realities and fears she's been pushing away. In 'Tomorrow Is Too Far,' a woman unlocks the devastating secret that surrounds her brother's death. The young mother at the center of 'Imitation' finds her comfortable life threatened when she learns that her husband back in Lagos has moved his mistress into their home. And the title storydepicts the choking loneliness of a Nigerian girl who moves to an America that turns out to be nothing like the country she expected; though falling in love brings her desires nearly within reach, a death in her homeland forces her to re-examine them.Searing and profound, suffused with beauty, sorrow and longing, this collection is a resounding confirmation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's prodigious storytelling powers.
