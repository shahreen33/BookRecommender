"The truly good stories in life are the one's where the characters go through a certain amount of turmoil and pain. A story becomes amazing when said characters overcome all that they have had to go through.All that's left is the ending... Good or bad?In our situation, we have no idea how it will end. I'm really hoping for a great ending, but in the meantime, we just need to keep writing. The story needs to have pain and conflict.There are still so many pages to go until we see the end."Tabitha's life was at a standstill.
