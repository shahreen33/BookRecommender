  From the bestselling author of 
  
    How Should a Person Be?
  
  , a daring novel about whether to be or not to be...a mom. A "courageous, necessary, visionary" book (Elif Batuman).
When I was younger, thinking about whether I wanted children, I always came back to this formula: If no one had told me anything about the world, I would have invented boyfriends. I'd have invented sex, friendships, art. I would not have invented child-rearing. I would have had to invent those other things to fulfil real longings in me, but if no one had ever told me that a person could create a person, and raise them into a citizen, it wouldn't have occurred to me as something to do. In fact, it would have sounded like a task to very much avoid. After the tumult of her 20s, the narrator of Sheila Heti's new novel finds herself living a life into which she could bring a child. She's with a man who has promised his support if she decides she wants to be a mother, "but you have to be sure." Motherhood chronicles her struggle, under pressure from friends, culture and time, and seeking answers from family, strangers, mysticism and chance, to make a wise and moral choice, and to truly understand what is gained, and what is lost, when a woman becomes a mother.  Heti treats the most universal and consequential decision of early to mid-adulthood--whether to have kids--with the candour and originality that have won her international acclaim, and that made How Should a Person Be? required reading for a generation of young women. The result is a courageous, funny and ultimately moving novel about motherhood, selfhood, and how--and for whom--to live.
