The protagonist of The Hole has discovered a hole in his apartment and tries to find an explanation for it. He seeks expert advice. But not everything can be explained. Perhaps he'll just have to accept that the hole is there? The Hole has simple, expressive drawings created by pen and computer, and there's a hole punched right through the book, so it really exists, even if it can't be explained.Comic yet philosophical, simple yet deeply expressive, The Hole is quite simply—brilliant!"Hello, I've discovered a hole in my apartment. . . . It moves. . . . If you could come take a look. . . . Bring it down, you say? What? Hello?!"Born in 1972, Øyvind Torseter is an artist and one of Norway's most acclaimed illustrators.
