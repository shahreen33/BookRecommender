Speak meets  The Scarlet Letter in this literary masterpiece, the recipient of five starred reviews and nominated for the 2014 Edgar Award Four years ago, Judith and her best friend disappeared from their small town of Roswell Station. Two years ago, only Judith returned, permanently mutilated, reviled and ignored by those who were once her friends and family.   Unable to speak, Judith lives like a ghost in her own home, silently pouring out her thoughts to the boy who's owned her heart as long as she can remember--even if he doesn't know it--her childhood friend, Lucas.   But when Roswell Station is attacked, long-buried secrets come to light, and Judith is forced to choose: continue to live in silence, or recover her voice, even if it means changing her world, and the lives around her, forever.Longlisted for the Carnegie Medal  A 2014 Edgar Award nominee for YAA YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults Top Ten title A Junior Library Guild Selection A School Library Journal Best Book of 2013 and 2014 "Battle of the Books" contender A Kirkus Reviews Best Teen Book for 2013 A Horn Book Fanfare 2013 title  A 2014 TAYSHAS Top Ten Pick
