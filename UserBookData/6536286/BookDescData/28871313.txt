Savannah Brown's first collection of poetry is a vulnerable account of adolescence from someone in the thick of it. Written between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, with examinations of anxiety, death, first loves, and first lusts, GRAFFITI extends a hand to those undergoing the trials and uncertainty of teenagehood, and assures them they're not alone.
