Here’s Paddington once more, just returned from a visit to Darkest Peru and his Aunt Lucy’s birthday celebration at the Home for Retired Bears. Now that Paddington is home with the Browns, he’s free to cause his usual kind of trouble: dabbling in the stock market, trying a career as a barber, even taking a turn at the ballet. But the promise of international fame doesn’t turn this bear’s head. Not for long, at least. Indeed, readers will agree, it’s far better to be simply a bear called Paddington.
