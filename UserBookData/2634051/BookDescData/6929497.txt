Following their Herculean - or is it Sisyphean? - efforts to save the living from ignorance, the two wittiest Johns in the English language turn their attention to the dead.As the authors themselves say, "The first thing that strikes you about the dead is just how many of them there are." Helpfully, Lloyd and Mitchinson have employed a simple - but ruthless - criterion for inclusion: The dead person has to be interesting.Here, then, is a dictionary of the dead, an encyclopedia of the embalmed. Ludicrous in scope, whimsical in its arrangement, this wildly entertaining tome presents pity and provocative biographies of the no-longer-living from the famous to the undeservedly and - until now - permanently obscure. Spades in hand, Lloyd and Mitchinson have dug up everything embarrassing, fascinating, and downright weird about their subjects' lives and added their own uniquely irreverent observations.Organized by capricious categories - such as dead people who died virgins, who kept pet monkeys, who lost limbs, whose corpses refused to stay put - the dearly departed, from the inventor of the stove to a cross-dressing, bear-baiting female gangster, finally receive the epitaphs they truly deserve.Discover:- Why Freud had a lifelong fear of trains- The one thing that really made Isaac Newton laugh- How Catherine the Great really died (no horse was involved)Much like the country doctor who cured smallpox (he's in here), Lloyd and Mitchinson have the perfect antidote for anyone out there dying of boredom. The Book of the Dead - like life itself - is hilarious, tragic, bizarre, and amazing. You may never pass a graveyard again without chuckling.
