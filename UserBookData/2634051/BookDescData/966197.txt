This new revised edition of the third book about Paddington captures all the playfulness of the incorrigible little bear. Living with the Brown family in London, Paddington has a talent for getting into trouble. His intentions are always the best, but he is seldom far from disaster. While his independent spirit and curious nature often get him into sticky situations, Paddington is always loved for the cheer he brings, and his stories have been a source of delight for young readers ever since he first appeared on the scene more than thirty years ago. Now, in an updated edition with a delightful new jacket by Diane DeGroat, Paddington is sure to capture the hearts of a new generation of children.
