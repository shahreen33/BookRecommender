Leaving home for college is never easy. Yet being on her own and making new friends is more exciting than Anne Shirley every dreamed possible. Not only does she sell her first story, but she also gets a marriage proposal--from the last person she expects. There's never a dull moment when she moves into a cozy cottage with her girlfriends, gets adopted by a troublemaker of a cat, and helps her best friend Diana plan the most beautiful wedding Prince Edward Island has ever seen.Just like Anne's friend Philippa says, something about Anne makes us "long to be better and wiser and stronger." It's no wonder she's a favorite character of everyone from Mark Twain to Duchess Kate and loved by generations of readers around the world.This new edition lovingly restores the original, unabridged text and includes an all-new, exclusive introduction with special memories from L.M. Montgomery's granddaughter.
