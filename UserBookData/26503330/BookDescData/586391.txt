For over a hundred years the Pacific island of Pala has been the scene of a unique experiment in civilisation. Its inhabitants live in a society where western science has been brought together with Eastern philosophy to create a paradise on earth. When cynical journalist, Will Farnaby, arrives to research potential oil reserves on Pala, he quickly falls in love with the way of life on the island. Soon the need to complete his mission becomes an intolerable burden and he must make a difficult choice.In counterpoint to Brave New World and Ape and Essence, in Island Huxley gives us his vision of utopia.WITH A BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION BY DAVID BRADSHAW
