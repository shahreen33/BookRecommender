Mostly because all of my HP books look like that hehe @inkspelIs Woah I absolutely love this quote! Basically, let's stop judging others on HOW they read and start celebrating the fact that we are all reading! To each their own! I personally don't care if I stain my books with tea or if I crack the spine. Others keep their books in mint condition! I mean, I'm not going to go submerge my book in the bathtub, obviously. But I'm not going to try to keep it 100% pristine! This article infuriated me, honestly. How come real "book lovers" can't mess up books?

Please convince me not to do this. https://t.co/09GehC20ED Hmmm what color do you think would look good?

I really want to dye my hair a fun color but also I don't want to destroy my curls + I don't think I could pull it off dang it @JustJade1551 Nope! You can read whatever!

Rowling https://t.co/Rki4ktxwJP @sarahilliger I love @rileymarie1196! She's given me so many great recommendations 😊 I meant please recommend me people who review books, but recommending LGBTQIA+ books is cool too! I'm up for all of the recommendations 😄 I'd love recommendations for LGBTQIA+ book reviewers (booktube, bookstagram, etc.)! @RandomLifeOfJoe Here you go!

I mean, I don't hate him, I just have trouble being sympathetic towards him. The more I reread this series, the more I understand every character and feel offended on their behalf (except, perhaps, Voldemort &amp; Snape) Sure he's mean, but isn't the whole of the series about how people shouldn't be discriminated against based on magical abilities or blood? I find it so rude that Filch is described as a "failed wizard" in Prisoner of Azkaban. Because...no? He's a squib, dude. @Virgos_Rule Also, I already have so many other books to read, so I probably should read those first haha! @Virgos_Rule I already checked and many of them are already checked out, unfortunately 😩 I just put myself on a book buying ban again, so this prob wasn't the best thing to tweet?

Books, equipment, etc. @_acciofandoms i mean probably https://t.co/33zKou4mc9 @elena_yip it will be my favorite youtube channel @mynameismarines  https://t.co/8gb7eZyYqP But, honestly, wouldn't it be impressive if I were able to make a BookTube channel without having read any of the books? @mynameismarines OH NO YOU'VE CAUGHT ME https://t.co/gfU3SuRXmf P.S. I have read all of the books I've included in my wrap ups (duh?) Sorry about ranting, I'm just tired of the misconceptions surrounding BookTubers and money. We do this bc of our love of books, not money. But basically, I don't even make enough from YouTube to live off of. It's just a fun hobby that pays as much as a part-time job! If you want to know more about how BookTubers make money, I highly recommend @emmmabooks's video: https://t.co/HJPnKIaqIC Sure, sponsored videos bring in some extra income along with Adsense, but definitely not as much as you probably think. I don't know of ANY BookTubers who have made "a shit ton of money from [their] channel." Just to let you know: I am a broke college student with debt and student loans. BookTube hasn't made me rich in the slightest? Even though I've been doing YouTube for years and have developed a pretty thick skin, these types of comments always bother me. So this was a comment on my latest video (in which I didn't personally give any advice?) https://t.co/LVkAi5TLad I know I'm probably going to look back at this tweet in a week and laugh at how optimistic I am Woah I woke up at 7:30 am and now I'm going to bed before 3 in the morning???

Mostly because all of my HP books look like that hehe @inkspelIs Woah I absolutely love this quote! Basically, let's stop judging others on HOW they read and start celebrating the fact that we are all reading! To each their own! I personally don't care if I stain my books with tea or if I crack the spine. Others keep their books in mint condition! I mean, I'm not going to go submerge my book in the bathtub, obviously. But I'm not going to try to keep it 100% pristine! This article infuriated me, honestly. How come real "book lovers" can't mess up books?

Please convince me not to do this. https://t.co/09GehC20ED Hmmm what color do you think would look good? (my hair grows pretty fast for curly hair so I could cut it off again if disaster strikes) @bibliojessi oh yes I will for SURE go to a professional if I do it because I am not knowledgeable about hair dye at all @readerwarehouse Honestly pastel pink hair is the DREAM (but I don't think I could pull it off) Because my hair is so dark I probably would have to bleach it which would remove a lot of my curl 😬 BUT I WANT FUN HAIR. I really want to dye my hair a fun color but also I don't want to destroy my curls + I don't think I could pull it off dang it @JustJade1551 Nope! You can read whatever!

I mean, I don't hate him, I just have trouble being sympathetic towards him. The more I reread this series, the more I understand every character and feel offended on their behalf (except, perhaps, Voldemort &amp; Snape) Sure he's mean, but isn't the whole of the series about how people shouldn't be discriminated against based on magical abilities or blood? I find it so rude that Filch is described as a "failed wizard" in Prisoner of Azkaban. Because...no? He's a squib, dude. @Virgos_Rule Also, I already have so many other books to read, so I probably should read those first haha! @Virgos_Rule I already checked and many of them are already checked out, unfortunately 😩 I just put myself on a book buying ban again, so this prob wasn't the best thing to tweet?

I have read all of the books I've included in my wrap ups (duh?) Sorry about ranting, I'm just tired of the misconceptions surrounding BookTubers and money. We do this bc of our love of books, not money. But basically, I don't even make enough from YouTube to live off of. It's just a fun hobby that pays as much as a part-time job! If you want to know more about how BookTubers make money, I highly recommend @emmmabooks's video: https://t.co/HJPnKIaqIC Sure, sponsored videos bring in some extra income along with Adsense, but definitely not as much as you probably think. I don't know of ANY BookTubers who have made "a shit ton of money from [their] channel." Just to let you know: I am a broke college student with debt and student loans. BookTube hasn't made me rich in the slightest? Even though I've been doing YouTube for years and have developed a pretty thick skin, these types of comments always bother me. So this was a comment on my latest video (in which I didn't personally give any advice?) https://t.co/LVkAi5TLad I know I'm probably going to look back at this tweet in a week and laugh at how optimistic I am Woah I woke up at 7:30 am and now I'm going to bed before 3 in the morning???
