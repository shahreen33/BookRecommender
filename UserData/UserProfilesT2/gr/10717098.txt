I am a certified romance junkie of every genre, Contemporary, YA, NA, Paranormal, you name it. As long as I get my happy ending. I don\'t particularly enjoy historical romance though. I also try to stay away from a lot of angst. I would rather laugh than cry when I\'m reading. I am true to my name and am a Goodreads addict. I love the friends I have made here. It is so amazing to be able to interact with others that share my love of books.<br><br>Please don\'t friend request me if you are just collecting friends. I love to talk so if you love to read and to talk about books, I\'m your girl!
