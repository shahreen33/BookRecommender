My name is Fatin and I\'m your typical average reader who loves to get my hands on so many books but barely has any time to read them!<br><br>My favourite genres are: Fantasy and Young Adult/New Adult.<br><br>I try to review most of the books I\'ve read as honestly as possible (and most of them end up being longer than I expected) and I hope that in turn, more people will read the books that I truly enjoyed! Some of my reviews may contain spoilers, just a fair warning there.<br><br>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - A definite favourite on my bookshelf, characters were amazing, plot was unexpected/beautiful, and I would most likely read it again one day.<br><br>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ -A really good read, but I might have a few issues with the book which don\'t really affect the plot. I might reread these one day.<br><br>⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Had a good idea going which captured my interest but the execution was not what I had expected. I probably had lost interest halfway through the book.<br><br>⭐️⭐️ - A little disappointed with most of the plot, but there are still some good take-aways I can address.<br><br>⭐️ - A huge disappointment, and I probably have stopped reading halfway because I really disliked the book.<br><br>Add me as a friend if we have things in common or you would like to get to know me and my books better! I\'m happy to accept everyone if you\'ve requested to be my friend :)', 'age': '21', 'gender': 'Female', 'location': None, 'interests': None}
