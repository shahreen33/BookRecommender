{'about': "I'm an up-and-coming novelist. I enjoy ranting about topics involving movies and books. I focus mainly on the action genre. My favourite kind of stories involve flawed anti-heroic characters in dark, dog-eat-dog worlds as they struggle to survive outlandishly violent situations that they caused in some way. <br /><br />I take most of my inspiration from anime and action movies that came out between 1965-2002.<br /><br />I have a dark sense of humour and I hate things that could set boundaries on artistic expression (like political correctness or censorship, both of which I'm highly against). I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, as I'm not often satisfied with my efforts the first time around and usually take 2-4 times before I'm happy with the results.", 'age': '24', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Manga, Anime, Action, Drawing, Writing, Reading, Video games, Music, Thriller, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Cyberpunk, Mystery'}
