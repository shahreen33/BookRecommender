I\'ve always kind of been a reader/bookworm ever since I learned reading in school. Words fascinated me and I started reading every single word (no matter the language) out loud to my family (which started to annoy them after a while because most pronunciations were obviously so wrong). My mother bought me books with funny stories so I could practise my reading, and it all started: I wanted to read more and more books. And here we are now :)<br /><br />Have a nice day!', 'age': '24', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Books, Photography'}
