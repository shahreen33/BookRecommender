It was so good and I totally recommend it.<br /><b>☆☆☆☆</b> I really enjoyed the book! <br /><b>☆☆☆</b> The book was good and I overall liked it but I had a few issues with it.<br /><b>☆☆</b> It was a 'meh' story. Although the premise sounded amazing it didn't develope well and I didn't connect with the characters and found the story a bit lacking sometimes.<br /><b>☆</b> I did not like this book at all! Probably because I either disliked the characters and/or story that it made my reading experience awful. I won’t recommend it.<br /><br /><i>Half stars are usually between both of those.</i><br /><br /><b>Side note:</b><i>I tend to change the ratings of some reviews (yes, I'm that kind of person). Also don't worry if I have some books unrated. I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts and how many stars I should give it. Or maybe I just completely forgot about it. Which happens a lot.</i>", 'age': '24', 'gender': 'Female', 'location': None, 'interests': 'Coffe and books. Or books and coffee.'}
