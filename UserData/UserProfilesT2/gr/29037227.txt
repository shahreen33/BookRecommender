I love the hunt for bargain books. I am a new lover of British crime fiction. I am a borderline book hoarder. My kids would say I read too much and have too many books and am going to go blind if I don\'t stop reading. <br><br>I\'m a medical transcriptionist and medical records coder working from home part-time. My kids are grown. I have 5 grandkids. I\'ve always been an avid reader. My grandma instilled the love for books in me taking me to the library with her and reading to me growing up. She used to read Harlequin romances by the box full. I also sell used women\'s clothing online.<br><br>I love animals especially my 2 year-old orange tabby cat. My older daughter rescues abused and abandoned cats. We are all animal lovers. <br><br>My to-be-read list is getting so long. I frequently enter Goodreads Giveaways and love winning free ARCs. I love reading fellow book-lovers reviews. I do read Kindle books, but really love to flip and fan the pages of a new book and smell the new book scent. I need more bookshelves. I told you I am obsessed!<br><br>I\'m from Santa Cruz, California. I am of Portuguese and Native-American descent. <br>', 'age': '59', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Soquel, CA', 'interests': "Reading, reading, and more reading.
