{'about': "I'm a huge bookworm and will read almost anything you put in front of me. It's rare to see me without a book at least nearby.<br /><br />I get into series really easily and will fangirl over my ships and OTP and pretty much anything related to that series. I will occasionally get into one (or more) later than not and I'll binge read the series up to the current book in order to catch up and immediately fangirl over all things series related.<br /><br />I like to write although I'm about 90% certain nothing will ever see the light of day.", 'age': '28', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Reading, Music, Movies'}
