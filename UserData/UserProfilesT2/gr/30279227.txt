My name is TS and I am one of the co-reviewers of Novel Notions, together with Petrik, Celeste and Haifa. If you do not want to miss any of our reviews, please follow and subscribe to Novel Notions. <br><br>More of an emotional/instinctual rather than a critical reader, my ratings reflect Goodreads scale literally, arising from how I feel during my read. <br>5-stars: Amazing<br>4-stars: Great<br>3-stars: Good<br>2-stars: Meh<br>1-star: Bad<br><br>My approach to reviews is always to remain spoiler-free and not to summarise the story. I typically focus around giving my thoughts around the key elements of what makes or break a book IMO, i.e. characters, plot, pacing, worldbuilding / setting and writing style. <br>', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Singapore, Singapore', 'interests': ' Aside from reading, I enjoy outdoor sports (running, hiking, cycling, frisbee), photography and travelling.'}
