{'about': "I hadn't been able to read in like 2 years because of my depression, bar fanfiction, when suddenly in April 2015 I got my mojo back. For someone who has always loved reading, those two years were hell. Looking at my book case, knowing there were loads of books I still wanted to read, books I wanted to <i>re</i>read, but just not being able to.. *shudders*<br /><br />I still have bad days, but so far I have never been in such a reading slump again!<br /><br />I have kept a notebook since then as well, keeping track of all the books I read. When I start them, when I finish them. It's a great way to make sure the dates are correct here on Goodreads, as sometimes timezones really mess things up.<br /><br />Now, in 2019, I have my own bookstagram, and a website/blog in the works. Perhaps I am biting off more than I can chew, but I am loving it so far!", 'age': '25', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Valkenswaard, Netherlands', 'interests': 'Greek Mythology, Oceanlife, Rabbits, Penguins, TV &amp; film, Music'}
