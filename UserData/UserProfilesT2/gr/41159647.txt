{'about': "Rooting For the Good Guys and A Happily Ever After<br />I love dual point of views. Hero &amp; Heroine finding love and some good old fashioned justice. No cliffhangers! I tend to research a series before starting in case the author goes off the rails and kills a character or has a betrayal so heinous that I may never recover. Twists and turns are one thing, but I hate surprises….at least the ones that leave an indelible mark. I’m not so particular about world building or character development, as long as the story pulls me in within the first 25 to 50 pages. I like action, mysteries, adventure and of course, as I’ve mentioned, romance – there’s never too much of that, unless of course the main characters get it on while bullets are whizzing over their heads. I just can’t get that.<br /><br />Audiobooks? Who doesn't love a good storyteller? The narrator makes or breaks the audio book scene. Some of my favorite books have been ruined in audio due to the unchanging and boring narrator.<br /><br />Favorite Authors: Laura Bickle, Thea Harrison, Tina Folsom, Patricia Briggs, Jim Butcher, John Conroe, Christopher Farnsworth, Justin Gustanis, Alex Hughes, Faith Hunter, Benedict Jacka, Darynda Jones, Richard Kadrey, Skye Knizley, Steve McHugh, Chloe Neill, Kalanya Price, J.D.
