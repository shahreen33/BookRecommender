{'about': 'My reading has changed over the past year or so. I used to love bonk-busters and juicy sagas (think Tilly Bagshawe, Tasmina Perry, Jackie Collins), but since around 2015 my tastes have been changing towards genre novels - mainly crime and thriller. I still do love the occasional chick lit book - my favourite authors in this genre are Milly Johnston &amp; Lucy Diamond.', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Belfast, J, The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'thriller, crime, genre, chicklit'}
