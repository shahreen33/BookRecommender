{'about': "I'm a TV junkie and book nerd who reads a wide range of fiction including romance, mysteries and thrillers, and women's fiction. I came back to reading romance in the last few years (my first romance reads were Janet Dailey and Jude Deveraux). Well, actually, I probably read Jackie Collins before that (when I so shouldn't have been). I write reviews for DailyWaffle, a lifestyle blog covering books, bricks, and bites. Our book coverage includes reviews and spotlights on contemporary romance, food-related fiction, some new adult/YA and cookbooks.
