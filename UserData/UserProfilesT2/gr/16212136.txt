{'about': 'I am Portable and mostly waterproof.<br /> I was born the day J.Robert Oppenheimer died, weirdly I have a physics background. I have been reading since about 1974 since I was seven but didn\'t really get the reading bug until I was a senior in high school (1985). I have a lot of interests and a wide variety of non-fiction tastes from Science to politics (standard left-liberal views, in a nutshell, an amped-up New Deal with post 1960s rights revolution are my ideal) and current events (more current the better), the arts (fairly mundane liking for Renaissance art and Modernism and impressionism (but if dogs playing poker is your thing its a free country for the time being)), Philosophy (I have some background in 20th century analytic school but I also like existentialism and I am not as allergic to postmodernism as I used to be, if they piss off the right they can\'t be all bad.)<br /> Another hobby is amateur Astronomy (own a Dobbs telescope and have an interest in archeoastronomy, legit stuff not ancient aliens) and I have good knowledge of celestial objects. I also have a pretty keen interest in modern cosmology. I am not religious but was raised Catholic and I study world religions as any good skeptic would. I hike in the woods for my job in which I work with children it is a great gig, and I know a little about plants and animals of New England. <br /> A hunch I have had about Anthropic shadow and big world immortality see links below. the Infinity of the world might fix mortality, very slacker, no moral effort required.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-154380542/why-earths-history-appears-so-miraculous-the-atlantic-peter-brannen" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/user-154380542...</a> <br /><br />Or the written Article <br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/human-existence-will-look-more-miraculous-the-longer-we-survive/554513/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/a...</a> <br /><br />P.S.
