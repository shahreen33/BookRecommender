{'about': "I am a very open person who loves to meet people. If we share an interest-all the better. I have a humanitarian view of life-treat others as you want to be treated. I also believe that anything should be allowed between two adults and that individual freedom and the right to live one's life the way one wants to without an adverse effect on the environment and those around you is the most important. The best thing you can do in this life is to contribute to man's love and respect of each other and to appreciate and be thankful for nature. Having religious faith is OK as long as you keep it a private affair between you and your God. Denmark is one of the few countries in the world that let's people live to these ideals, and that is why I love living here. follow me on Periscope/Twitter @stevegpickering", 'age': '65', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Vedbaek, Denmark', 'interests': 'Copenhagen, Blues, Playing Guitar, Massage Therapist (Self), Tantra, Yoga, Dogs, Swimming, Walking, Having fun, Concerts, Rotary'}
