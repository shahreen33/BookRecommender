{'about': 'Although as a child I had dreams of writing books as well as having a career and a family, I never managed to get around actually finishing one. <br />As a young girl, I wrote short stories and plays for my own pleasure and to read to my little sister at the time. The plays we sometimes acted out in front of our family.<br />Now 50 something years young, I have picked up this hobby again. I am a mother, wife and career woman, and I carefully try to guard my privacy. Born in The Netherlands, but residing in the UK, I consider myself more or less bilingual.<br />Now my own family is growing up, I have finally picked up this little hobby of mine. I hope you enjoy reading my work as much as I enjoyed writing it and hope to hear what you think of it.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://jonimartinsauthor.blogspot.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">https://jonimartinsauthor.blogspot.co...</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/joni.martins.543" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/joni.martins...</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JoniMartins3" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/JoniMartins3</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joni-martins-b93673157/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/in/joni-mart...</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.books2read.com/ap/8Gq5MR/Joni-Martins" rel="nofollow">https://www.books2read.com/ap/8Gq5MR/...</a>', 'age': '56', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': None}
