{'about': 'Check Out my Bookish Instagram! <br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mybookishbehaviour/" rel="nofollow">https://www.instagram.com/mybookishbe...</a><br /><br />This year: 2019: <br />My main goal this year is to finish off my actual accumulative pile of books that I own on multiple formats. Since this has become quite overwhelming, resulting in failed attempts across the last few years, I\'ve decided to challenge myself and change up my method. <br /><br />RULES: <br />1. I can only schedule (pick) 3 books total for the month before it begins. <br />2. of these three books each will represent a format that I have too many books on<br />3. 1 book will be a physical book, another will be audio, and the third will be a E-book<br />4. I pick these three with a good old fashioned game of Book Bingo. <br />I made a sheet using a website with prompts like "a book with black on the cover", or "a predicted 5 star read" etc. If I have difficulty with a prompt due to too many books that correspond to the prompt, I will pick whichever has been on my shelf the longest.<br />5. I can add more to my Tbr only IF I am close to finishing my 3 mandatory reads of the month. <br /><br />TBR pick and bingo notices will go up on my Instagram story, so be sure to follow me there. link above :) <br /><br /><br /><br />', 'age': '28', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': None}
