{'about': "Hi! I'm Wilmarie and like most people here I am obsessed with books. On this profile, you'll find out what books I read this year, what I thought of them, and what books I want to read. You can also find me on Instagram @lesbe.reader, on Twitter @winkwinkwinki or on my blog the link is above. <br /><br />STAR RATING:<br /><br />★★★★★ = I'm obsessed. I'll probably be talking about it all the time.<br />★★★★ = It was so good, I might even love it but it just didn't have that special spark.<br />★★★ = It was a good book, a solid read. It wasn't bad or okay, it was good but just not enough.<br />★★ = It was an okay book. I didn't die for it but I didn't hate it. It could also be that I was kind of bored.<br />★ = I hated this book with all my soul! ", 'age': '23', 'gender': 'Female', 'location': None, 'interests': None}
