{'about': "I write YA and Adult fantasy and sci-fi. I've had several short stories and pod casts published in the last year and my debut novel is due out next month ;) I love reading and seriously start to go a bit peculiar if I don't get through at least three books a week. <br /><br />I'm a martial arts nut: I've studied twelve different disciplines but I'm most accomplished in Goju Ryu karate which I've trained in and taught for almost twenty years (Crikey!). My favourite things include books (obviously), slippers, cheese and surreal conversations.<br /><br />I have been accused of liking animals better than humans on several occasions. With some justification.<br /><br />", 'age': '40', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Cotswolds, The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'Martial Arts - especially Karate, dead languages, alternative medicine, Writing, '}
