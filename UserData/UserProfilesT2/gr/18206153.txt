{'about': 'I am a loving wife and mother of four. Three of my children have special needs (Autism, Wolf-Hirschorn Syndrome, and ADHD/Dyslexia), contributing to a very busy household. I was a nurse on the medical unit at Seattle Children\'s Hospital for about ten years before life at home became too busy to allow for a career. I published a book, With Angel\'s Wings, in October of 2013. It is a true medical drama/unconventional love story. It is a 100% true memoir, however names were changed and I wrote it in the third person, so it reads like a novel.
