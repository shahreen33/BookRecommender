{'about': 'тнe world waѕ нerѕ ғor тнe readιng <br /><br />I love everything about books, the smell of the pages, that you can step back in time with a turn of a page or flash forward to the future. Be the heroine of times gone by or in the mind of serial killer. I love it all!! The variety. The talent. <br /><br />Some of my favourite authors are Susan Mallery, Karen Rose, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Julia Quinn, Amanda Quick (the list could go on) they all have their own way of telling a story, of drawing you in. <br /><br />👏🏻 Making you believe 👏🏻 ', 'age': '38', 'gender': None, 'location': 'The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'Reading, Photography, Art &amp; Football'}
