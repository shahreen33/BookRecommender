{'about': 'I am an avid reader and have been most of my life. Almost every picture of me growing up has me with a book in my hand and around 9/10 years old I actually used to have a goodreads style rating system for the books I had read taped to the side of my wardrobe and chose a book of the year every December, so ending up here was kind of destiny I suppose. I also have a passionate love for coffee.<br /><br />I will pretty much give any book, by any author, in any genre a go.<br /><br />I was unable to read much for 10 years or so due to an eye condition called retinopathy which made reading all but impossible, but with some preventative, not cosmetic, laser eye surgery to the retina I have sight, albeit blurry a lot of the time, enough to read. While I still read and will always love and prefer actual physical books, my kindle has made it so much easier for my to read again and catch up on 10 years of missed reading time.<br /><br />Anything else you want to know....just ask!', 'age': '47', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Durham, The United Kingdom', 'interests': None}
