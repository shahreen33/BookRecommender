{'about': "Avid reader of young adult literature. (I wrote a Master's thesis focusing on personal journeys in young adult fantasy books.) Just as avid reader of graphic novels, particularly manga. I love stories focused on other cultures, particularly Asian cultures, and I love books based on folklore and mythology. <br /><br />A note on my rating system: <br />2 stars: Did not connect with the book in the way I'd hoped. <br />3 stars: I genuinely enjoyed reading the story. <br />4 stars: I greatly enjoyed reading this story and would consider reading it again. <br />5 stars: I LOVE the book. It sticks with me for months and years after reading it. I rant about the book to family members and friends and encourage everyone to read it. <br /><br />I give very few five star ratings because I want them to be a distinction for the books that have truly stood out to me. Thus, a four-star rating from me is a really, really good rating.", 'age': '33', 'gender': None, 'location': 'East Hartford, CT', 'interests': 'Reading &amp; Writing (especially young adult and especially fantasy!), Manga and Anime, Japnese culture and mythology, Yoga, Cooking, and Graphic Design'}
