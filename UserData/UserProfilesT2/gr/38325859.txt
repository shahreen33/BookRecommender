{'about': 'Hi, my name is Brittney. I am a licensed English educator from Arkansas. I just finished grad school for my English Masters in Education. I teach Reading skills for English Language Arts at a small district in Missouri. I love to read Young Adult Literature and I tend to read 50+ books a year. I am active on my Instagram account @bookishdetours and I love to update here as well. I love discussing literature with students and I hope to encourage them to read more. I want my students to have a connection with literature and I hope to grow this connection through my teaching and interaction. I like to read a diverse set of books, but I tend to stick with Young Adult literature. I love reading Fantasy books with unique worlds and storylines.<br /><br />Other things about me:<br />I love going on new adventures and traveling. <br />I can definitely be described as an avid reader. <br />Rick Riordan is my favorite author. <br />(I also love Victoria Schwab, Marissa Meyer, Sarah J Maas, Jenn Bennet, Morgan Matson, Kasie West, Leigh Bardugo, and Emma Mills.)<br />I also love to binge watch movies and tv shows. <br />My favorite music is pop, oldies, and Christmas music.<br />I love to teach; it has always been my dream since seventh grade.<br /><br />', 'age': '24', 'gender': None, 'location': 'The United States', 'interests': 'Reading, collecting books/bookmarks, traveling, adventure '}
