{'about': "Book obsessed and constantly have my Kindle with me...you never know when there might be a spare 5 mins to squeeze in a page, or 10. Happily married to my own Mr Darcy and mum to two bookworms. Am frequently sleep deprived owing to having to read just one more chapter before bed. I love books about MC guys, Hockey players, Rock Gods, feisty heroines and billionaires who wear grey ties.Not a fan of sci-fi or paranormal. <br /><br />Top authors include Autumn Jones Lake, Kristen Callihan, Toni Aleo, Susan Fanetti, Harper Sloan, Brenda Rothert, Chanel Cleeton, Karina Halle, Sarina Bowen, Elle Kennedy....I could go on. <br /><br />Give me a book and I'm happy. Give me a fabulous romance and I'm in Kindle Nirvana.
