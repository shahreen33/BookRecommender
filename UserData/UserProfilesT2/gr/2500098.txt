Shipping is not included. <br /><br />On Friending: <br /><br />When I first got on Goodreads, I was friended by a multitude of people...who eventually never interacted with me. I now have a policy: <br /><br />Are you interested in at least a good 30-50% of my books/reviews? <br /><br />If so, add me. Please give a reason other than liking my reviews. I want to INTERACT with people, not have more friends just because. There\'s a follow button for a reason. If you like my reviews, but aren\'t interested in discussing books, follow instead. However, I WILL be checking out book compatibility, and if we have very few interests, don\'t expect me to push the accept button. It\'s NOT PERSONAL. Seriously. I just don\'t want to be burdened with friends who don\'t provide anything besides a number. <br /><br />The one exception, of course, is those who know me in real life.<br /><br />**Please note: If you add me multiple times, you are probably going to get blocked. And believe me, I keep track.***', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Fredericton, NB, Canada', 'interests': "Reading-there isn't much else, but if you insist I also do a lot of the following: writing, cross stitch, scrapbook, gaming, lots of other crafty things-some of them failures."}
