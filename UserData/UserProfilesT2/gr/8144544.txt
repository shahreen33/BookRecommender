{'about': 'I\'m a baby boomer, born and raised in the Minneapolis area, married since 1978, living in a small town in southern Minnesota.<br /><br />I majored in music education in college. My first job was teaching instrumental music in a very small town in northern Minnesota. Since that time my careers have included: financial planner, commodities futures speculator, wine consultant (one of those geeks who knows everything about wine and helps you buy just the right bottle in the retail wine shop), and private investor/trader.<br /><br />I\'m now a freelance writer/novelist. I write blog posts, essays, reviews, articles, short stories, and novels.
