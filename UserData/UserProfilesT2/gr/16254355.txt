{'about': 'Goodreads is my favorite social media - it seems like I can usually avoid politics, religion, anger, trolls, etc. here. If you want to fight, force political agenda, spam, etc. please do not friend me! But, if you want to talk about books - any books (even religious and political books with an open mind) - feel free to add me as a friend.<br /><br />I am obsessed with making sure I update my book progress daily!<br /><br />If you like my status or my reviews, I will probably check out your profile and compare our books. Depending on your "friend request" criteria, book interests, etc., you may see a request from me!<br /><br />I would list my favorite authors/books here, but my shelves, ratings, and group memberships speak for themselves.
