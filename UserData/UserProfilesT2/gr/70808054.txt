{'about': "I'm a 20-year-old girl who loves to read a lot (although I'm a slow reader, sadly), to write stories (mostly unread by people because I'm ~shy~), and to fangirl (seriously, I have a LOT of fandoms). I'm also somewhat introverted, which is something most people don't expect of me because I'm really talkative. But the thing is, I only talk a lot because I don't get to talk much when I'm alone. Eheheheheheh. That's why, because I'm introverted, I like to build friendships online. It's actually really fun that way. :) <br /><br />That being said, you can FOLLOW ME IN MY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SITES!!! <br />", 'age': '21', 'gender': 'Female', 'location': 'Philippines', 'interests': 'reading, writing, fangirling, daydreaming'}
