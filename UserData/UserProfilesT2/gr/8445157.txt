{'about': 'How did I find myself here? Writing yet another "About Me" blurb? I hate these things, but yet, I can\'t stop myself. I\'m pretty simple...I\'m 36, a wife, mother to a 4 year old boy, a social worker, and a lover of music and books. I\'m not fancy or a literary snob. I read for enjoyment, not to feel intellectually superior. I am partial to mystery and psychological thrillers but read a lot of different genres. ', 'age': '36', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'reading, writing, yoga, fitness, healthy eating, celebrity gossip, good conversation, laughter, family'}
