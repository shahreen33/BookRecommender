{'about': "I used to hate reading. It was like pulling teeth just to get me to pick up a book. But I finally discovered an author that I absolutely loved. I ended up reading the second book in a series. I ended up staying up past my bedtime with a flashlight to read that book, I loved it, and then surprised my parents by asking to go back to the bookstore and get the rest of the books in the series, then got the other series that the author wrote, then the next then the next. I even fell in love with one of the characters, even though my main ficitional-squeeze is Hector from the Iliad, George Cooper is definitely my love.<br />Sometimes I still find it hard to find books that I actually enjoy reading, but that usually just means I hadn't been looking good enough. I tend to be one of those kinds of people that if I like the book I must finish it as quickly as possible, often times ruining my sleep schedule, but very worth it.", 'age': '33', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Conroe, TX', 'interests': 'reading, writing, fantasy, vampires, scifi, religious texts, latin, greek, classics, myths, mythology, heroines'}
