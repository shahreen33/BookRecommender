Why haven\'t you read this yet. This was amazing and I definitely cried.<br><br>★★★★ – Almost perfect! A few things I wasn\'t a fan of but overall it was great! I also probably cried.<br><br>★★★ – It was alright. I most likely would not read this again but I would still recommend it to others who I feel it would fit.<br><br>★★ – meh. not good at all, debatable if I will continue if it is a series, but has the potential to do better!<br><br>★ – It did not meet the potential at all and I would definitely not recommend this for people to read. Avoid at all costs.
