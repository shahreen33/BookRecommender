{'about': 'I do not accept review requests. Been there done that. I read to escape the stress of living with chronic pain among other things. Not to add to it. <br /><br />My group here on Goodreads for those who love reading about all kinds of creatures! Mermaids, Vampires, Fairies, Aliens, Shifters etc! 18+ Group called "Creatures, Creatures Everywhere!"<br /><br />Me at a quick glance:<br /><br />They/He. Bisexual. Non-binary and Trans (Agender demiguy and transmasculine specifically). HuffleClaw. Aquarius. INFP. Disabled. VACteRL Association &amp; more. Neurodivergent. Has Aphantasia. Wiccan.<br /><br />Not a woman or a man.<br /><br />Warning: I read a wide variety of things, which includes Erotica, both normal erotica and more taboo things. <br /><br />More In-Depth, if you want..<br /><br />The only stuff I won\'t touch is Christian Fiction or Medical Thrillers/Horror/Erotica, for personal reasons. Not against it, it\'s just not for me.<br /><br />My favorite creatures are vampires. I love sapphic romance the most but will read any kind of pairing. Nonfiction i\'m drawn to the most is sciences (particularly animals), feminism, disability or lgbt+ studies. <br /><br />Goosebumps got me started in reading. I fell out of love with reading for awhile, read Harry Potter at 26, found Booktube &amp; it just snowballed from there!<br /><br />I read mostly for fun &amp; to escape real life. Sometimes to learn things.<br /><br />My star ratings/reviews are just my personal opinions/thoughts. They\'re for me more than anything else. <br /><br />1 star- No<br />1.25- 1.75 stars- Really disliked<br />2-2.75- Slightly disliked<br />3-3.25 stars- ok/I liked it<br />3.5-3.75 stars- I enjoyed this<br />4-4.25 stars- really enjoyed it<br />4.5-5 stars- loved it!', 'age': '30', 'gender': 'Non-binary', 'location': None, 'interests': 'Reading, Art, Gaming, Youtube, Internet, TV, Movies, Puzzles'}
