{'about': "I am trying to get myself to read more. I watch too much trashy TV because it is easier than picking up a book. 2014 will be my 7th year in the 50 books challenge. So far I have logged in 30 books in 2008, 22 books in 2009, 29 books in 2010, 23 books in 2011, 28 in 2012 and only 7 in 2013( two kids make this challenge VERY challenging). I hope this will be the year for 50, but don't hold your breath : )", 'age': '42', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Arlington Heights, IL', 'interests': 'photography, scrapbooking, traveling'}
