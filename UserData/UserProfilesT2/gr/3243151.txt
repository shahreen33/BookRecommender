Also, I can\'t spell and punctuate‚ò∫ I also am extremely HONEST when I write a review, so if you can\'t handle that, please don\'t ask me to review your book.<br>Not yet scared off? You can of course ask me to review your book - either via email or here on goodreads, I\'m just not able to accept everything, because there\'s just waaay too much to read!<br><br>P.S.:<br>I HATE: religious books (an author thanking god in the acknowledgments is almost a hard-limit for me!), Paranormal (shapeshifters, witches...), not enough sex in sexy books, outer space, futuristic (with the exception of J.D. Robb, because...Roarke!!)<br><br>P.P.S.:<br>We also translate books from English into German - if you\'re interested in that, email us!', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Germany', 'interests': 'Bianca ~ Reader of Books ‚Ä¢ Writer of Honest Reviews ‚Ä¢ Eater of Everything Good ‚Ä¢ Listener of Music ‚Ä¢ Watcher of TV-Shows &amp; üèà ‚Ä¢ Taker of Naps ‚Ä¢ Hater of Summer'}
