{'about': "Tweeting at @MaynardLara - lots bookish; enjoy participating in #SundaySentence and #todayspoem. Bookstagramming @lara.maynard. <br /><br />Have worked in writing and publishing, organized bookish events, and now volunteering with my local library board, including the library book club. <br /><br />Have piles of books and stuffed bookshelves. My TBR grows like Jack's beanstalk on super fertilizer-steroids.<br /><br />l value libraries and librarians.<br /><br />As someone who digs folklore, history and heritage, my go-to genre is historical fiction. Never say never, but am not usually into commercial romance, anything trying hard to be really chick lit-ish, or New Agey enlightenment/self-help sort of stuff. Don't usally go for fantasy, futuristic, dystopian or apocalyptic. Nor vampires, werewolves and their cousins. Will go for faeries and ghosts sometimes, and do like a bit of gothic! Will read contemporary fiction when it explores a theme or subject that draws my attention.<br /><br /> Admittedly have not yet read the whole Harry Potter series, but l think l’m Ravenclaw. Not into a whole lot of YA books, though I'm very glad YAs are. I treasure reading memories of my Nancy Drew and Anne of Green Gables years.<br /><br />I tend to read a lot of novels by female authors. And l’ve been doing more graphic novels, illustrated books for all ages, short story collections, nonfiction and audiobooks recently.<br /><br />Love cookbooks, especially with cakes, pies and desserts of all kinds with lovely photos.<br /><br />On TV I love PBS Masterpiece and watch Sherlock, Coronation Street, Poldark, Call the Midwife, and most anything British. I also watch documentaries. Lately watching Netflix with hubby. And re-watching Sex &amp; The City with my old besties.<br /><br />Otherwise baking, cats, writing, gardening, genealogy, films, all things heritage-y, bookishness, friends and family, current events and keeping life and limb together.", 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Canada', 'interests': 'Newfoundland, WWII women, vintage jewelry, gardening, desserts, baking, cultural heritage, folklore, architecture, cemeteries, historic sites, British TV, costume drama'}
