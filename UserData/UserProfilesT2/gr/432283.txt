{'about': "I'm a Law Clerk by day and a bookworm by night. I always have a book with me and I try to read as much as I can whenever possible. <br /><br />I will read just about anything. Some of my favourite authors are John Green, George R.R. Martin, Catherine McKenzie, J.R. Ward, J.K. Rowling, Marissa Meyer, and many more!<br /><br />When I'm not reading, I like to write. I've participated in NaNoWriMo for four years. One day I would love to publish a story of my very own!", 'age': '35', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Keswick, ON, Canada', 'interests': 'Reading, writing, roleplaying, swimming, watching movies'}
