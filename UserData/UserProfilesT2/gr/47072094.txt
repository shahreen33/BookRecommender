{'about': 'Hello! I\'m Clara and reading is a huge passion of mine. You\'d probably find me in my bed with my cat, a huge cup of tea and a really good book. If I\'m not reading, I\'d most likely be watching Booktube videos, writing book reviews or creating stories. I\'m a bookstagrammer, and my instagram account is "clarylovesbooks", and I also have a bookish blog and you can find it through the link in my bio. ❤️<br /><br />Instagram: @clarylovesbooks<br />Affiliazione Amazon: <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Kz6YHG" rel="nofollow">https://amzn.to/2Kz6YHG</a><br /><br /><i>“The more you try to crush your true nature, the more it will control you.
