{'about': "*Freelance Editor &amp; Proofreader @ KimBookJunkie.com* <br /><br />I am a happily married mom to a 13 year old son who is a handful most of the time and thankfully a sweet angel the rest. I broke my neck so had to stop working as a social worker and therapist. Books, which were always my hobby, became my primary distraction and coping mechanism for my neck pain and eventually led to me becoming a freelance editor and proofreader! I love almost every type of romance and erotica (BDSM, menage, f/f, m/m, taboo and any other combo), but dark erotica is by far my favorite and what I primarily read. Although my favorite books tend to contain sex, it's not mandatory! I also enjoy non-paranormal horror and occasionally read psychological thrillers and memoirs. I prefer books that contain a thorough plot and interesting, unique characters, yet I have nothing against reading trashy smut periodically, too!", 'age': None, 'gender': 'Female', 'location': 'The United States', 'interests': 'Being with my family, socializing on GR or Facebook &amp; READING!!!!!!!!!
