{'about': 'Born and raised in London (proud of it ! ), lived all around the UK and in France and now living in Shropshire. Worked for a large IT company until I became a part-time gardener for my neighbours at age 49, and now retired completely to concentrate on reading and enjoying life.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I finished the library (sounds posh but is really just a room with loads of book shelves a sofa, my guitars and a TV - chill room) that I have just completely re-vamped from floor to ceiling), I now find that all my books that had been residing in boxes since returning from living in France do not fit on all the shelves in my new "library". So I have very little room for new books, and I love real paper books. I will have to get used to my kindle :-)', 'age': '60', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Ironbridge, The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'Reading (obviously) , music (late 70s &amp; 80s) , cycling , walking , yoga , 70s motorcycles , gardening and growing veg , my French farm cats and my family'}
