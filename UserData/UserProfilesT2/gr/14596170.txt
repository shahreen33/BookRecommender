{'about': "hiiiii<br /><br />Oh God, I hate talking about myself. If it comes naturally in a conversation, why yes! And I do enjoy sharing my opinion on stuff, but right here right now all I'm thinking about is going back to my book. Been into memoirs lately and Michelle Obama is waiting to share the secrets of the universe with me. But you're reading this and you're expecting to find out what makes me so special. Haha. Probably nothing. I'm just a girl trying to survive university. So far, so good. But I really should start reading my school stuff instead of books that Goodreads tempts me with. <br /><br />If you're kind, talk to me!!! If not, begone!!! <br />", 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Canada', 'interests': 'Knowledge, Feminism, Education'}
