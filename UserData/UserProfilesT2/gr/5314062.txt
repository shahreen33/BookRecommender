{'about': 'Children\'s Book Blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://itsabouttimemamaw.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://itsabouttimemamaw.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />My name is Patricia. I am a wife and a mother of five gorgeous daughters and fifteen precious grandchildren. <br /><br />I have an Etsy Shop, which is on HOLD for now, where I sell handmade children\'s clothing, also lap, stadium and crib quilts. Custom orders are welcome when the shop returns to business. <br /><br />I have always loved reading. My earliest readings was Nancy Drew. Historical Christian Fiction is what I best enjoy reading, Christian and Inspirational. Some of my favorite authors are Janette Oke, Margaret Brownley, Susan F. Craft, Beth Wiseman, Cindy Woodsmall and Tamara Alexander. I enjoy Love Inspired Historical Fiction and Love Finds You. <br /><br />On my Christian book blog, It\'s Time To Read Mamaw and my Children\'s book blog, It\'s About Time Mamaw I have authors as guest, book tours, book reviews and book giveaways. <br /><br />If you are an author and would like to be featured on my blog or if you would like me to read and review your book please contact me. <br /><br />As far as my education I attended Court Reporting Institute.<br /> <br />I am now retired and enjoying the life the Good Lord has given me.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://itsabouttimemamaw.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://itsabouttimemamaw.blogspot.com/</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://itstimetoreadmamaw.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://itstimetoreadmamaw.blogspot.com/</a><br />Twiter@ItsTimeMamaw', 'age': '69', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'my grandkids, reading, sewing, quilting, gardening'}
