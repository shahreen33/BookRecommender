{'about': "A lover of life, sports, music, and of course books. <br /><br />I've enjoyed reading from an early age and if I really wanted to I would cancel my cable and live with radio playing music in the background as I read. <br /><br />My taste in reading is varied and the only reading I don't care for are text books and self help titles. I read to escape the reality that surrounds me. <br /><br />I enjoy seeing a movie after I have read the book just to see if how I imagined it really comes close to what is put on the screen. <br /><br />", 'age': '56', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Warren, PA', 'interests': None}
