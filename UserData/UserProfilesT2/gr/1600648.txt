{'about': 'I originally wrote my cookbook for my 3 children, adults now. My oldest daughter gave me the idea when she requested that I write down my Banana Pudding recipe before I died. I have made banana pudding all of my life and made it my mother\'s way... no measuring. So I made it and measured as I went along. This gave me the idea of making a cookbook. I started making the dishes I knew all 3 enjoyed, measured, wrote the recipes down and entered them into the computer. My youngest daughter later told me that she couldn\'t bring deviled eggs to Thanksgiving dinner because she couldn\'t peel a boiled egg without tearing it up. That reminded me that I had the pleasure of having a stay at home mom who taught me to cook but I worked and didn\'t have time to do the same with my daughters. So I started adding tips to my recipes. I also realized that not all 3 of my kids enjoyed the same ingredients. This gave me the idea of including suggestions to change ingredients. Plus, as I went along, I remembered some of my cooking experiences both as a child and adult. I thought it would be nice to include these short stories so they would know that we all make mistakes when cooking. <br /><br />My book grew and since I\'m a terrible speller, I had a friend proof-read for me. She enjoyed the book so much she suggested I have it published. So, I took her advice, sent my manuscript to a publisher, they liked it so much that the next thing I knew I had a contract in my hand and a year later a published book.<br /><br />For more info about me, my book and my style of cooking, visit my blog stirlaughrepeat.blogspot.com and my website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marthaskitchenkorner.com" rel="nofollow">www.marthaskitchenkorner.com</a>', 'age': '69', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Charlotte, NC', 'interests': 'cooking'}
