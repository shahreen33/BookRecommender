{'about': 'My debut Epic Fantasy novel: Black Cross - first book from the tales of the Black Powder Wars, was released on 10th January 2015. It is available for Kindle/Free Kindle App here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Cross-First-tales-Powder-ebook/dp/B00RH7F3OM" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Cross-F...</a><br /><br />First book of a series, Black Cross is set in a fantasy world grounded in historical realism (to a certain point, of course). Although there are monsters, mages and other such curiosities akin to any good fantasy series, there is a gritty realism to many of the characters involved, be them men-at-arms, assassins, children or inquisitors.<br /><br />The beauty I find with fantasy, is the ability to pull varying aspects of our own history together, without being bound by the rules of authenticity. Be it medieval knights versus witchunters, or archer bearing carracks versus cannon laden galleons, I have injected historical elements where I feel they are needed, and let my imagination take over everywhere else.<br /><br />If fantasy is your genre, or maybe even historical fiction, then I\'m sure Black Cross and my following novels (Black Guild has already been started) will have something to keep you entertained; combat, violence, comedy, sorrow or love, these are the aspects of stories that keep me reading and wanting more, and I hope it does you too.', 'age': '38', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Cotswolds, The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'Writing Fantasy Fiction, Reading, Wildlife, Pets, Walking, History, Motorbikes, Snowboarding, Diving'}
