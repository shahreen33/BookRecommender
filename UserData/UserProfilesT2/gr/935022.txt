{'about': "I hate trying to sum up myself in a short space, but here are the points essential for goodreads.com: I'm a Classicist, a historian, a poet, an author, and an educator. I teach Latin, among other things. I am a philosopher and a poet. I am a humanist and I believe in the ideals of the West - democratic republicanism, liberty, equality, justice, and so forth. My guilty pleasure is science fiction and fantasy fiction, especially classic stuff (like Robert E. Howard) and/or darker stuff (like H.P. Lovecraft). <br />", 'age': '44', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Latin, Greek, Classsics, Classical Studies, History, Philosophy, Education, Military History, Ancient Rome, Science Fiction, Fantasy'}
