{'about': "I'm a professional writer with nearly a dozen published novels under my belt. I've sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, although you won't have seen my name on the covers as I ghostwrote for high-profile authors. I am now writing acclaimed fiction under my own name. I'm a writer, journalist, fiction editor and the author of the Nail Your Novel series for writers.<br />I also coach writers at all levels, from newbies to the oft-published. A manuscript I doctored in early form won the Roald Dahl Funny Prize 2012. <br />I have a website rozmorris.wordpress.com<br />Find me on Twitter @Roz_Morris", 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'London, H9, The United Kingdom', 'interests': 'writing'}
