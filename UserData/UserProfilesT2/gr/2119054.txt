{'about': 'I always hate these "about me" sections, but feel the need to fill them out.<br /><br />I\'m a Jersey girl who at one point in time ran my own indie music zine, Chelsea Smiles. From it I gained great experiences, new friends, and awesome memories.<br /><br />I\'m a YA Librarian who spends way too much time with her nose stuck in a book. Hey, it\'s my job!<br /><br />I\'m a hopeful writer. I want nothing more out of life to spend my free time and days writing.<br /><br />I\'m a believer in the DIY ethic. I craft whenever I have the chance, I support crafters and people also with the DIY ethic. <br /><br />', 'age': '36', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Books, Music, Movies'}
