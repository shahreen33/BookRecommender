{'about': "<br />--&gt; I actually write REVIEWS! :D<br />--&gt; My ratings are subject to change over time.<br /><br />Love to write and read, but mostly write. If I get inspiration through a book or movie I'll stay up all night writing the scene. Finished a novel after 3 years of working on it and am working on many side projects and short stories.<br /> Can't get enough Transformers and am absolutely CRAZY about movies and video games (mostly Xbox360).", 'age': '28', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'Writing novels and poems, Reading, Playing X-Box360'}
