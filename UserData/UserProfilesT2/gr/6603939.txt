{'about': 'Cynthia Luhrs is the author of the Shadow Walkers novels. A graduate of Towson University, she was practical, majoring in Business which served her well now that she’s a writer and needs to stay organized. Her idea of a perfect day is no interruptions and the freedom to live in her head all day, writing to her heart’s content, an icy cold soda next to her as she creates the next Shadow Walkers book. Of course her cats like to disrupt this oasis of serenity.', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'reading, gardening, movies'}
