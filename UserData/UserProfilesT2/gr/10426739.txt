{'about': "Hey everyone! <br /><br />My name is Mandy. It's fantastic to meet you. Let me share a little bit about myself...<br /><br />1. I am a mom to 3 (Kayleigh '04, Devon '06, and Connor '07)<br />2. I have been married to my hubs Dave since 2005. <br />3. I work full time as a manager at a video game store which ROCKS since my family is a compilation of gamers, book nerds, and geeky swag collectors! <br />4. My first memories in life involve books. Thanks Grams &lt;3<br />5. Reading has always been my favorite hobby and my likes have evolved over time. I started by reading romance, evolved into the young adult vampire craze, into young adult fiction, fantasy, and a little bit of sci fi. <br /><br />Thanks for joining in on the reading love! &lt;3 <br /><br />", 'age': '34', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Midland, MI', 'interests': 'Reading, shopping, crafts, planners, YouTube'}
