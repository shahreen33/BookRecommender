{'about': 'From the first "adult" book I read in the 3rd grade "The Fellowship of the Ring" by JRR Tolkien, I have been in love with reading and have never ceased devouring all in front of me. While my tastes have certainly branched out from fantasy, leaping into philosophy, sociology, spirituality, history and science, with my trusty Kindle in hand and Mac ready to type, the world of literature and thought is ready to be constantly opened and explored.', 'age': '39', 'gender': None, 'location': 'The United States', 'interests': 'psychology, spirituality, philosophy, science, history'}
