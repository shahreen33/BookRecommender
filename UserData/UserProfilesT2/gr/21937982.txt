{'about': "*Due to the 5000 person friend limit on goodreads I can no longer accept friend requests but you can follow me instead!*<br /><br />I do not accept review requests from Goodreads. <br /><br />My rating system:<br />5 stars- absolutely loved it<br />4 stars- it was really good<br />3 stars- it was pretty average<br />2 stars- it was alright<br />1 star- didn't like it at all<br /><br />* I will use a .5 rating (e.g 4.5) for a book that is on the cusp of the next level of rating for whatever reason so I can give the most accurate rating possible. Sometimes I'll even use. .75 (eg. 4.75) if there is one minor, tiny little flaw that made me unable to give the next highest rating. <br /><br />PS- I hardly ever check my Goodreads messages so sorry if I don't reply.<br />", 'age': '23', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Canada', 'interests': None}
