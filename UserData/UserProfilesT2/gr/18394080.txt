{'about': "I'm me! Actually, I'm a woman who reads avidly (I'm a paranormal romance junkie!), writes occasionally, video games more than she should, has a ton of opinions just dying to get out, is a desperate coffee addict, not-so closeted anime/manga fangirl, and an agoraphobic. And secretly, I'm a huge Ian Somerhalder fan (i.e. stalker...). Shhhh, don't tell anyone!<br /><br />I'm also currently rereading everything for Goodreads right now as I want to make sure my read list is right, my books are rated and reviewed, and I'm caught up on my favorite series!
