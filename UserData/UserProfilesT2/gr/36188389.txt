{'about': "Hello!!! For those of you that don't know my name is Emma and I love reading. You may have previously known me as Chicklit vs Fantasy. My favourite genres if you hadn't already guessed are Chicklit and Fantasy, I also love the sub genre paranormal and I read a lot of YA fantasy. I'm 27 but still pretending I'm 23. I live with my boyfriend and our Frenchie Basil. I have 5 brothers and growing up being the only girl taught me a lot about the other sex and exactly how to get them to see things your way. I'm a chocoholic and a bit of foodie. I love to eat but only enjoy cooking when I have a lot of time. I've always been a girly girl who loves make up and nails but I'm not the best at either lol. I've been a book blogger for 3 years now and it's hands down the best decision I ever made.<br /><br />", 'age': '30', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': None}
