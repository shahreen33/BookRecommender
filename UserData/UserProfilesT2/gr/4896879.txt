{'about': 'Find/follow @alyshasarchives on Facebook and Instagram for my book stuff!<br /><br />My personal ratings include half-stars which Goodreads doesn\'t allow, so any of my ratings that include a half-star will be bumped up to the next whole star rating. The same with a 0.0 star rating - it will be bumped up to one star.<br /><br /><br />I let my website hosting lapse since I was seldom updating the site, but eventually I\'ll get it back up. And thanks to the wayback machine, I still have access to all my posts and the like. If you see a link in one of my reviews for a "full review" apologies in advance for it being broken.
