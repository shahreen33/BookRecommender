{'about': "I don't remember a life without books. I was way ahead of my class in learning to read. When I was 5, I would get into my mom's smutty romance novels and tell her how naughty they were. Even now, I read anything I can get my hands on. I usually flip flop between difficult novels or classics, and relaxing chick-lit. I love anything history related, and I am very much a hopeless romantic.", 'age': '32', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Fishers, IN', 'interests': None}
