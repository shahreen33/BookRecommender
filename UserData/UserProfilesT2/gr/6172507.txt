{'about': "I am the author of The Penitent Assassin and The Savage Nobles trilogy (Stolen Dagger, Stolen Justice, Stolen Crown). <br />I started reading at the age of four and have never stopped. At seven or so, I began writing stories and fell in love with the creative process. My life-long dream has been to become an author and now with these books out in the world, I'm expanding my dream -- someday I hope to become a full-time writer. Currently, I'm working on a stand-alone sequel to both The Penitent Assassin and The Savage Nobles trilogy.", 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'The United States', 'interests': 'Writing fantasy novels, author of The Penitent Assassin &amp; two other books, riding bikes, movies &amp; hanging out with my wife and kids.'}
