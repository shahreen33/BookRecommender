{'about': "I've lived all my life in the same village in the Bradford area, so see myself as something of a latter day Bronte sister (except I've only got brothers!) I'm really interested in history and fairy tale, and you'll find that faith also comes into my work a lot. I love all things North European and East Asian, and have a particularly special relationship with Japan. (I finally went there last year!) <br /><br />I've written a lot of short stories - not so many books so far - and love to perform my work locally. So do check out my website and see what else I'm up to!
