{'about': 'Two things I love to do the most include graphic design and writing. I was an editor at a publishing company for several years; I saw the graphic designers at work and thought, ‘I’d like to do that.’ So I went to art school.<br /><br />I love to read, write and draw. Yes, I am a creative nerd type. I like to read all kinds of books, but science fiction and fantasy is my guilty pleasure.', 'age': None, 'gender': None, 'location': 'Louisville, KY', 'interests': 'graphic design, reading, writing'}
