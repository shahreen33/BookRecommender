{'about': "I'm a lifetime read-aholic. I've been reading since before I could remember. The first books I remember reading? Nancy Drew in second grade. By the summer before 5th grade I'd read them all.<br />I own over 400 books and have read over two thousand. (I'm sure there's plenty that I've read but can't remember.)<br />In May 2013, I finished my second Masters degree (MA in History). Though I am no longer in the historical and academic field some of my favorite genres are history and historical fiction.<br />I'm off to read but come back soon!", 'age': '34', 'gender': None, 'location': None, 'interests': 'running, history'}
