{'about': 'Hello, I am in my late twenties, just trying to live again. I absolutely love to read, write, dance, long walks and listen to music. Often you can find me reading one thing or the other. I adore mythologies, of any kind. I am extremely shy and on top of that, an introvert. It’s really hard for me to connect to people, even online. Yes, almost laughable, isn’t it?<br><br>I haven’t done much writing with proper intent before but I have just started doing so in the last few weeks. I am extremely new to this and it would show.
