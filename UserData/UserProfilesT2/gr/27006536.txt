{'about': "My love affair with books began when I was a tot. A fabulous mother, who recognized the power of the written word, read to me and my sisters every night, introducing us to the wonderful world of the imagination.<br /><br />Once I could read on my own, I graduated from fairy tales to adventure stories to romance, spending all my pocket money on books. My father served in the army and took the family along mostly wherever he went, resulting in experiences that beg to find a place in my books.<br /><br />I am a doctor, but make time for my other passions – reading and writing stories, watching romantic comedies, and doing creative things with wool and a crochet hook. I also love solving the Hindu crossword, and - when my muse is elusive - I enjoy pitting my wits against my husband's at Scrabble®. When I have no other choice, I can be found in the kitchen putting together my 'world-famous' one-pot meals.<br /><br />Writing about love and happy endings feeds my romantic soul. 'Scorched by His Fire' is my first published piece of romantic fiction, and is courtesy of Mills and Boon® India's Passions Contest which I won in 2013. 'The Cure was Love', also from Mills and Boon® India, released in November 2014.<br /><br />Hearing from my readers thrills me.
