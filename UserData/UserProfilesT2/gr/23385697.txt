{'about': '"I read like the flame reads the wood." <br /><br />I attempt to make my book reviews clear, insightful and a pleasure to read. I aspire to the high standard of accomplished reviewers such as Michiko Kakutani, Carlin Romano, James Wood, Christopher Buckley and Edmund White.<br /><br />Starting 8/2018 - I will no longer be using the star system; rather, I would like to simply let my reviews speak for themselves. This is exactly what happens with book reviews in such publications as the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>. I also might have some fun reviewing books where a five star rating would be entirely inappropriate. <br /><br />8/2013 - 7/2018 - My awarding 5 stars means the book in my opinion is well worth the time to read and will broaden a reader\'s horizons. Of the more than 4,000 books I\'ve read over the past 50 years, the books I\'ve reviewed between these dates are the 5 star cream. <br /><br />Author of microfiction and a novella published in the little magazines back in the 1990s<br /><br />Art lover and avid listener of classical music.
