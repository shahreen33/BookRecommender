Proverbs 2:2-5<br /><br />And because, through a book, I can travel the world, learn from others, experience new realities, and integrate new connections that I could not do on my own.<br /><br />NOTE to perspective friends: I want friends who THINK about what they read, WRITE compelling reviews and like to INTERACT about what they are reading. I generally don\'t accept invites from people who have more friends than books or who have only read books they\'ve authored (according to GoodReads).<br /><br /><br />', 'age': '46', 'gender': None, 'location': 'Chicago, IL', 'interests': 'Historical fiction, Christian Church history, Culture and Cross-Cultural interactions, Classic Literature, Homeschool, Biography, Theology'}
