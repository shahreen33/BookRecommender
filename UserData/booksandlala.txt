I am Team NO PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA 18. Cheesecake should not be a thing. It is so gross. 17. The only acceptable pie flavour is Strawberry Rhubarb. Fight me! 16. Don't get me started on croutons. How. Why. Ew. 15. Plain/flat chips over rippled chips all day! 14. I've never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I gag at the idea of it. 13. I can't stand juice. I want to get into juicing and juice cleanses but I just can't stand the stuff by itself. In smoothies it's just ok 12. I fucking love onions. Burnt ones especially. 11. I think Oreos are the grossest of all the cookies. 10. Fries dipped in honey is better than fries and ketchup. 9. Nutella and cookie butter are two of the grossest food inventions ever. 8.

One of the best things about internet friends is seeing them fight someone in your video comments for leaving a shitty comment about you. RT @gaileyfrey: So does bisexual mean once every two genders, or does it mean twice every gender And I think that translates to being respectful with our technology. My friends don't pull out phones at dinner or in a theatre. This tweet took 3 different directions. I don't know what I'm talking about. Not that they're too old to grasp technology, but maybe it's not as much of a seamless relationship. @novelparadise Aw thanks taryn! 🙈 @Claribel_Ortega Straight. Up. If all of my teen years were documented on the Internet, it would be utter humiliation. My peers spent our early teen years with dial up internet and corded phones. I think we truly appreciate how convenient technology is now! And the "generation" 10+ years above me were already adults when cell phones and the internet and social media became a part of daily life. I'm such an old fogey but I hate going out to the movies bc teens are on their phone. So many of them. In the theatre. The entire time. How. And of course not a ALL teens, but that "generation" are so glued to their phones that they lose semblance of courtesy. Seeing teens 10+ years younger than me living their formative years on twitter and tinder and surrounded by camera phones makes me anxious. What a random thing to tweet. I just often feel grateful that I didn't have to deal with the pressures of social media as a young teen. I think I was born at just the perfect time in technology development.

Supporting your library is supporting your community. For low income families- libraries allow kids to pick out whatever they want without parents having to budget &amp; limit reading. For the kids with disabilities- libraries offer a variety of free resources, such as audiobooks, large print, braille, ebooks etc. For kids with unstable or unhealthy home lives- libraries offer a safe space. For kids questioning/understanding/accepting their sexuality- libraries offer a place to learning without the feeling of being monitored. For kids being raised in homes that shut down discourse due to strict political, religious beliefs- libraries give a safe space to research. Libraries are so important for everyone, but especially our youth. Thread⬇ #borrowathon https://t.co/Q6m5KjmaBV A4. a selfie with my library card for #borrowathon.

An author often isn't going to write an ownvoices narrative every single time right? So each book is either ownvoices, or it's not. -but we should still be supporting that author and their work, even if that one particular book isn't ownvoices. If a marginalized author writes a book/character that doesnt reflect them or their experience, it makes that particular book not ownvoices- I keep seeing the phrase "ownvoices author" used, but shouldn't it be "ownvoices book" instead?

Ahhhh! Seeya in 800 pages 😅 https://t.co/UeXMXhsxfY RT @emojiathon: hello hello hello! It's 9am here and I'm READY to read, how about you? -@obbsandLala @EpicReads Cover Designer. @rileymarie1196 Ideally don't talk about the book at all b/c it promotes bad rep. But I'm hearing yes it needs to be mentioned every time. @rileymarie1196 I've been thinking about this as well. @ObbsandLala I didn't need to do this stream of consciousness publicly, but I was trying to make sense of what I was feeling. @ObbsandLala because they are not here to educate me. And if I have to ask, maybe I already have an idea of the answer? @ObbsandLala my feed is full of people harmed by this book synopsis. But I can't outright ask them "is this word harmful in MY context?" @ObbsandLala I'll do better in the future, but in regards to the readathon, I'm not sure where to go from here. @ObbsandLala if a group I don't belong to, says something is hurtful, it is my obligation to listen. @ObbsandLala changing it to "spookython" still comes from the same place, no? I'm hearing "people get offended by everything nowawadays" but @ObbsandLala I'm trying to educate myself on if "spook" is harmful in this context, and I'm being told it's not unless referring to a person @ObbsandLala not to make this about me, because it's not. But I wouldn't want the thriller readathon to be misconstrued or hurtful. @ObbsandLala nothing was said to me directly, but I don't expect anyone to have educated me on the word- I should have known myself.

So bummed. @pisceshawty didn't they feature him in last year's list 🤔 @monicakwatson for sure. I wish the rep was there from the start.

Glad he doesn't have a love interest at least. @Bookquotes221 Love it. Some things bother me like the romanticized teen-teacher relationship, and I hope they turn that around real soon. @sannevanzwol I LOVE space stuff, but prefer it more on the contemporary side as opposed to science fiction but there's not much out there!

One of the best things about internet friends is seeing them fight someone in your video comments for leaving a shitty comment about you. RT @gaileyfrey: So does bisexual mean once every two genders, or does it mean twice every gender And I think that translates to being respectful with our technology. My friends don't pull out phones at dinner or in a theatre. This tweet took 3 different directions. I don't know what I'm talking about. Not that they're too old to grasp technology, but maybe it's not as much of a seamless relationship. @novelparadise Aw thanks taryn! 🙈 @Claribel_Ortega Straight. Up. If all of my teen years were documented on the Internet, it would be utter humiliation. My peers spent our early teen years with dial up internet and corded phones. I think we truly appreciate how convenient technology is now! And the "generation" 10+ years above me were already adults when cell phones and the internet and social media became a part of daily life. I'm such an old fogey but I hate going out to the movies bc teens are on their phone. So many of them. In the theatre. The entire time. How. And of course not a ALL teens, but that "generation" are so glued to their phones that they lose semblance of courtesy. Seeing teens 10+ years younger than me living their formative years on twitter and tinder and surrounded by camera phones makes me anxious. What a random thing to tweet. I just often feel grateful that I didn't have to deal with the pressures of social media as a young teen. I think I was born at just the perfect time in technology development.

Supporting your library is supporting your community. For low income families- libraries allow kids to pick out whatever they want without parents having to budget &amp; limit reading. For the kids with disabilities- libraries offer a variety of free resources, such as audiobooks, large print, braille, ebooks etc. For kids with unstable or unhealthy home lives- libraries offer a safe space. For kids questioning/understanding/accepting their sexuality- libraries offer a place to learning without the feeling of being monitored. For kids being raised in homes that shut down discourse due to strict political, religious beliefs- libraries give a safe space to research. Libraries are so important for everyone, but especially our youth. Thread⬇ #borrowathon https://t.co/Q6m5KjmaBV A4. a selfie with my library card for #borrowathon.

An author often isn't going to write an ownvoices narrative every single time right? So each book is either ownvoices, or it's not. -but we should still be supporting that author and their work, even if that one particular book isn't ownvoices. If a marginalized author writes a book/character that doesnt reflect them or their experience, it makes that particular book not ownvoices- I keep seeing the phrase "ownvoices author" used, but shouldn't it be "ownvoices book" instead?

It's 9am here and I'm READY to read, how about you? -@obbsandLala @EpicReads Cover Designer. @rileymarie1196 Ideally don't talk about the book at all b/c it promotes bad rep. But I'm hearing yes it needs to be mentioned every time. @rileymarie1196 I've been thinking about this as well. @ObbsandLala I didn't need to do this stream of consciousness publicly, but I was trying to make sense of what I was feeling. @ObbsandLala because they are not here to educate me. And if I have to ask, maybe I already have an idea of the answer? @ObbsandLala my feed is full of people harmed by this book synopsis. But I can't outright ask them "is this word harmful in MY context?" @ObbsandLala I'll do better in the future, but in regards to the readathon, I'm not sure where to go from here. @ObbsandLala if a group I don't belong to, says something is hurtful, it is my obligation to listen. @ObbsandLala changing it to "spookython" still comes from the same place, no? I'm hearing "people get offended by everything nowawadays" but @ObbsandLala I'm trying to educate myself on if "spook" is harmful in this context, and I'm being told it's not unless referring to a person @ObbsandLala not to make this about me, because it's not. But I wouldn't want the thriller readathon to be misconstrued or hurtful. @ObbsandLala nothing was said to me directly, but I don't expect anyone to have educated me on the word- I should have known myself.
