"Sorry!!!" a beater hits it away towards the Huffle chaser!  #HPRQuidditch Out of the corner of her eye, the Ravenclaw seeker spots the Snitch. She blinks and its gone! #HPRQuidditch The other chasers distract, while the one with the quaffle shoots and SCORES! WOOT! #HPRQuidditch Beaters make sure Huffles stay clear of the Ravenclaw chaser @cristeneanne #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaws get back the Quaffle after a beater uses a Bludger Backbeat to hit the Huffle in possession. #HPRQuidditch @Ruthsic AND a bludger unbrooms you just as you're about to unleash the monster, he walks away confused toward the crowd! #HPRQuidditch Beaters take out the Huffles one by one, smashing the bludgers towards them and unbrooming them. #HPRQuidditch The audience now has some delicious spaghetti to eat! #HPRQuidditch Professor McGonagall finally despells the spaghetti monster and plates fly to catch the remaining spaghetti. #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw chasers get the Quaffle, passing it back and forth as they head down the field! #HPRQuidditch With bludgers flying, the chaser is knocked down and Ravenclaws get the Quaffle back before she scores! #HPRQuidditch The RAVENCLAWS SCORE! #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw chaser races around the spaghetti, bludgers, Peeves, &amp; Death Eaters &amp; closes in on the goal! She Throws the QUAFFLE #HPRQuidditch The Order of the Phoenix is on the Ravenclaws side and deal with the Death Eaters without bothering the match. #HPRQuidditch Stopping the bludger with a Dopplebeater Defense, the beaters get in a quick high five before racing away on their brooms! #HPRQuidditch The keeper can't stand it and finally lifts the musical curse from her team! #HPRQuidditch @ems1324567 @Ruthsic Don't forget the hashtag!!! #HPRQuidditch The Claws race back with the quaffle, singing and dancing on their brooms and somehow not falling off. THEY SHOOT AND SCORE! #HPRQuidditch Singing a jolly tune, they recover the Quaffle and head back for the Huffle Goal Post and SCORE! #HPRQuidditch @Ruthsic Music doesn't throw off the Claws though and their beaters send bludgers the way of the puffs, dislodging‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bwEeIj6xq6 WOOOT! Ravenclaws cheer as they wait to see what Huffles will do with the Quaffle next. #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw keeper untangles from the spaghetti and tosses the Quaffle to a nearby chaser. #HPRQuidditch The chasers race down the field. @Ruthsic The Beaters beat a bludger to knock out the Huffle, her quaffle throw goes wide and gets stuck in the sphaghetti! #HPRQuidditch One Ravenclaw Chaser heads towards the Huffle goal as another distracts with mooning the keeper. AND THEY SCORE! #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw keeper casts her own shield spell to cover her teammates against any more Hufflepuff tricks. #HPRQuidditch Beaters are laughing at Peeve's pranks, but quickly get on task as the bludgers go flying wildly by. #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw is back in POSSESSION of the Quaffle and heading down the FIELD! #HPRQuidditch Catching the Quaffle, Ravenclaw keeper sends it off to one of her chasers, who flies at a fury down the field. #HPRQuidditch THe keeper deflects with her own wand and yells for a penalty! That's cheating! #HPRQuidditch Luckily, the keeper is part of Dumbledore's Army and knows advanced spells now. #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw keeper defends the goal, having already figured out the counterspell for his furry nature. #HPRQuidditch A chaser performs a sloth grip roll in order to snag the dropped Quaffle and gain possession of it while still on their broom! #HPRQuidditch A Ravenclaw beater sends a bludger towards the hufflepuff in possession of the Quaffle, making her drop it. #HPRQuidditch The seeker is staying out of the way, dodging bludgers and keeping an eye out for the snitch. #HPRQuidditch And they're off, two of the chasers perform a Porskoff Ploy - heading in different directions and passing the quaffle. #HPRQuidditch Beaters start to bat at the bludgers, sending them soaring towards Hufflepuff team members #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw chasers grab for the Quaffle and nab it, flying off in a frenzy to try for the first goal. #HPRQuidditch @SpellsAndBeasts Our last one was nutters so I expect more of the same! #HPRQuidditch @Ruthsic @SpellsAndBeasts @HPReadathon Haha, competitive too! :) #HPRQuidditch @HPReadathon WOOT WOOT! #HPRQuidditch @SpellsAndBeasts @HPReadathon NEVER! :) We know what we're up against! #HPRQuidditch Ravenclaw crew is here!!! #HPRQuidditch Let's do this Eagles!! :) #HPRQuidditch @Ruthsic AHHH I hope we both win lol. :) #HPRQuidditch I'm here!!!! #HPRQuidditch On page 119 of 340 of The Masked City, by Genevieve Cogman https://t.co/7HJhfOq5R5 @Ruthsic You have 23 more hours to do it :) Here is my constellation! #HPRStars #HPReadathon2017 https://t.co/TpedFPsf6o @HPReadathon Yay so excited!
