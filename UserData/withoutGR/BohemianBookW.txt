My favorite book of all time is Pride and Prejudice, among many others! @jillianquinn7 I hope it works for you! 😀 I never really have time for a full re-read either but I love to revisit the characters. @larkinchurchill see I always want to read so many classics, but I feel like the past couple years they have fallen by the wayside. 😕 @jillianquinn7 You should try it! I don't always do it in order, I just pick up the one that fits my mood, it always helps me! @larkinchurchill That has to be it! It just always surprises me every year, not that I dislike classics they just aren't my normal genre. @PhreyPress well at least you have goals for the week! I'm one of those that plans by the day 90% of the time! I need to get it together! @jillianquinn7 I just always want to re-read Harry Potter! It's one of the things I read to get me out of slumps! But I can see it in Dec! 😊 @PhreyPress Yes! This is my life and it only ends up leaving me more stressed! 😣 Does anyone else get the weird urge to read classics during December?!
