Or rather, my editing planning, since I'll be mostly polishing first drafts.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/xLPWW0lLhg @elliotwrites Yeah, variety and all that :)   Though, it's high time all these drafts are polished. @z_a_tanis Cool :)  We're hoping to publish the series in the second half of next year. @elliotwrites planned to edit first drafts in 2017 and getting them submission/publish ready. Might do 1 block of writing new stuff/ a day @elliotwrites Enjoy the fresh project :)  Not writing anything new is going to be a difficult challenge for me next year, since I only ... @z_a_tanis I am very ahppy with the progress, though :) @z_a_tanis Thanks:) But it's not the title of my story, it's the series title of a shared worldbuilding project I'm working on :) Just reached 20K in my HAVE HUMAN, WILL TRAVEL story #amwriting Getting a better idea of how I want this to go. @kmpenemue 3K on weekdays, 2 blocks of writing on Sat/Sun. (though aiming for 3K today, cause I was too bloody tired to write yesterday) @ttkove that sucks...  I hope you can sort if out (((((hug))))) @ttkove need a tester? @LizGreenash Succes!!! :D @LizGreenash *fingers crossed* dat het je helpt overzicht te houden @LizGreenash Okay... dan dus een korte beschrijving per hoofdstuk?  Of een puntenlijst met gebeurtenissen. @LizGreenash pas in... @LizGreenash Dat ik per scene schrijf. Err... Sommigen schrijven per hoofdstuk, en sommigen schrijven alles achter elkaar, en delen daarna @LizGreenash TOch knap... helemaal herschrijven... Heb ik nog nooit echt gedaan... Ik voeg altijd net zoveel scenes toe als nodig, en delete @LizGreenash Maar ja... ik werk scene based... niet iedereen doet dat... @LizGreenash gebeurtenissen in een scene? (met evt POV character en setting).  Misschien dat dat wat overzicht brengt? @LizGreenash da's een begin, iig. Heb je ooit al eens een scene lijst gemaakt? Of te wel, korte omschrijving van de belangrijkste... @ttkove I can't even remember what I effed up with that one... only that I couldn't change it, so had to start anew... @LizGreenash hmmm... erg vervelend. Ik wou dat ik daar tips voor had... @ttkove we're human... and some of those check boxes aren't alway obvious @tamiveldura Looking spiffy :D @ttkove together with 3 other books, so... couldn't afford the mistake @ttkove My amazon one is a book that sould have been pre-order... but I forgot the check it as such... and had to redo (since it came out... @ttkove As far as I know, you can't... (I still have an inactive one because I made a mistake) Can't do that on Amazon, either... Very silly @LizGreenash Gek genoeg heb ik bij het editen juist meer overzicht (na een keer herlezen en notities maken dus) @AleksandrVoinov Hmm... I could track scenes, since I write mostly scene based. That might work I'll set something up before January @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov ((((hug))))  Yeah... I don't have a 'dayjob' next to the writing (and family stuff)  @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov But pages doesn't work, either, since I do most my editing in Scrivener (up until that last hard copy edit) @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov I'm still looking for a better way to track editing... I used wc upto now, but not sure that works for me. @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov Of course, I still write mostly at home... @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov I use a spreadsheet for that... but I work in blocks of 20 minutes, so miles may vary... @ttkove TMW you have your MC enthusiastically use a scanner, only to remember he's severely dyslexic, so can't read what the output means #amwriting @AleksandrVoinov I have two bujos... one for daily planning, and one for writing planning. Not sure I'm keeping it that way, though @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov That's the reason I went with OneNote over excel/google, because I can check it on my phone. @ttkove @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov  LOL Looking at other people's planners is exactly how I started mine, so... natural progression? @AleksandrVoinov writing/submitting...  Though, I did place every project in a specific quarter of the year...  @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov NICE!  And way more organised that mine... So far I'm only noting the wc goal, and tasks like plotting/editing... @ttkove @AleksandrVoinov @ttkove  Your offline version looks better than my offline version :p @ttkove Since the 2010 (I think) OneNote is free with Office...  No idea about Mac... that's still a pipeline dream ;) @LizGreenash Dat gevoel hebben we allemaal we eens ;) @ttkove :) thanks  The links are automatically corrected when I move a story from one folder to another, so, that's a plus! @ttkove these are my OneNote folders (in my WIPs notebook) https://t.co/bLgs7KEwEN @ttkove when I'm 'out of the office') And slowly but surely this is what I came up with  And that was a bit much for tweet wordcounts lol @ttkove But that didn't work all that well for me, so I dove into OneNote (since the app's on my phone as well, and I use it for story notes @ttkove I started using it after @AleksandrVoinov linked to his own planning a couple of years back, done in google spreadsheet, i think... @ttkove I move a story from 'writing' to 'ffd' when the draft is finished, and to 'editing'... same names as th folders on my hdd @ttkove Still, the titles link to the story page (also in OneNote, with a self made page template), and I have several folders in it, so ... @ttkove The program is OneNote. And the colour coding is nice, though limited (not that many colours to choose from) @ttkove Thanks :) Not sure about organised, though. This year's planning fell way short (despite NaNo going very well, and Dec's not bad) @LaneSwift Thanks :)  When I look it at, all I'm thinking is, "These aren't even ALL my first drafts." *hangs head* So, yeah.. .high time I've never dared to post a WIP planning before, so I thought it was high time I got over that.

I've been wondering whether plotting would work better for me if I wrote scene cards that said: "MC1 thinks MC2 is an arse."  and vice versa As much as I've come to love plotting, I tend to get lost in details and technicalities, and overthink things. It's hard to find balance.

I haven't found it yet  If it's not... I'll see about emailing ;) @jordanlhawk @tamiveldura my only niggle... it numbers days through the whole month, instead of saying day 10 week 2  @jordanlhawk @tamiveldura I'm finding that out. It'll take some time to insert all the kills... but... I think I'm liking it. @jordanlhawk @jordanlhawk Also. The code works :) @jordanlhawk Not sure this will go any faster, but I can at least be more specific than I was in my excel kill time line (weeks/months only) @elliotwrites (((((hug))))) @amasour AMEN!!!  I'm always so disappointed when reading an SFF book, &amp; the author chose 'contemporary rules' considering GLBTQ characters @jordanlhawk Sounds good :)  Thanks!! @jordanlhawk Now I wished I'd used my NaNo code in December... ouch! Has anyone in my timeline used Aeon TImeline for Fantasy/Scifi calendars that differ from 'normal' calendars? What are your experiences? @jordanlhawk I'll look into it. Thanks :) @elliotwrites (not our collab world, btw) @elliotwrites I forgot the kill timeline (and damn, this guy killed a lot over the past 38 years *sigh*) @elliotwrites more boringly repetitive than painful.  And I do like the way my months/weeks/days work now, better... but yeah... @elliotwrites and yet... we fall for it, every time  LOL @jordanlhawk I've looked at it before, but couldn't really get into it. Didn't know you could change the calendars. How flexible is it? When changing a fictional world calendar means having to change the kill timeline as well. calculates x*(a/b)=?  over and over #amplotting @amasour (((((hug))))) I hope Bird is all right @Erastes :) *crosses fingers* @elliotwrites Never give the other half ammunition (she says after making that same mistake numerous times in the past... err... 27 years) @RiptideBooks Maybe they don't realise ppl outside those regions read English, too...

That is a fad coming from fanfiction, it has nothing to do with publishing @Andrea_Dalling @acosmistmachine @tamiveldura to become that pairing @Andrea_Dalling @acosmistmachine @tamiveldura M/M means that the main relationship is between men, it says nothing about their journey... @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura and publishers place their books. @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura Also... that division would be mostly a marketing thing, so... it depends on where authors... @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura I think they're only helpful if there is an accurate division between both. But there isn't @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura but mileage may vary, and I can understand why some don't like the romance=escapism connection @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura any books based on true stories,and veer towards books showing worlds that might be... @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura mean I don't appreciate realism or serious subjects in books. That just means I stay away from @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura a problem with it. I read to enjoy, to escape into other worlds for a while. But that doesn't @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura Depends on what your definition of escapism is, I think. Mine is pretty broad, so, I don't see @acosmistmachine *sigh* @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura  Not to mention that romance itself more or less implies escapism. @acosmistmachine @Andrea_Dalling @tamiveldura I agree.

And I'm more than all right with  whatever they choose @GallagherWitt having kids isn't the be all and end all for everyone, but it's so rooted into society that most barely realise that. @GallagherWitt I keep wanting to say something profound to this, but all I can do is smile :) @GallagherWitt still, they're now 20+ and decent human beings, so... nothing to complain about (at the moment  lol) @GallagherWitt :) I was naive and bowled over by all these cute babies in the hubs' family...and wanted one... Got what I asked for... @GallagherWitt or maybe it's just because I easily pick up sounds and impressions, and it distracts the hell out of me... @GallagherWitt doubly annoying when your kids actually do what you say, then visit others, and none of those parents demand the same... @GallagherWitt *cough* I'm also the bitch mum who told her kids to either put headphones on or NO SOUND on their gameboys @GallagherWitt sounds from the table behind us First comment to the hubs was, "I thought we left the kids at home?" @GallagherWitt You'd think. Though... when the hubs and I went out on our anniversary, I still spent ALL BLOODY DINNER listening to pokemon @GallagherWitt Of course.. mine are 20+, so gladly take them anywhere now ;) @GallagherWitt they can be themselves, and 2) don't want to ruin other ppl going out when my kids get antsy from having to sit still... @GallagherWitt *nods* We barely took our kids anywhere except kid friendly places when they were young. Because, 1) you want kids to feel @GallagherWitt dark place with incredibly loud noise all around? What parent would expect their child to sleep through that? @GallagherWitt was years ago, though @GallagherWitt I think we can.

I sent them an email (seem to have lost my ability to type) @EvieKiels Yup. Send an email, because I don't care, I'd just change the de to com, but I don't want readers to land in the 'wrong' store @EvieKiels Though I haven't moved my account from the .com one yet, purely because the NL one only sells ebooks... @EvieKiels So was I, it seemed, but it sent me to the German one, where I'm not allowed to buy ebooks *head desk* (and there IS a Dutch one) @EvieKiels Is that your usual shop?
