You're purposely being obtuse. He was misogynistic and disrespectful and I am done. @joeymwilson @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 if you're dumb enough to do it in a public forum on camera...sorry, dude, yeah that might happen @joeymwilson @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 No, it's not. He can say it because of freedom of expression but that doesn't mean free of consequences @joeymwilson @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 I am aware. I've watched the video, know the original joke. It's still juvenile and shouldn't be excused @joeymwilson @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 If he made a holocaust joke and thought it was hilarious and the joke started in England - that's okay? @SeanHastheMic @regreg187 @jec79 yepper! @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 Whatevs...done with you, dude. Try some critical thinking one day. @dailygallows @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo the primary source? @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 Again...the misogynist's anthem - "It was just a joke" @dailygallows @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo omg. I'm NOT saying I don't believe it I just want an alternate source. #criticalthinkingisathing. @dailygallows @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo I am simply looking for an alternate link so that I can do my own research. I'm not taking sides. @dailygallows @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo No. I am saying the only story I see/can find is by news sites that I have found to be unreliable. @dailygallows @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm asking if there is a more reliable news source for the story. @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo Obviously I've read the soccer fan story as evidenced by my tweets.. I was talking about the Afreeda Zaman story. @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 Is there a more reliable news source for this story?Can you link me?  I have issues with Sun news. @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 So because she got away with deplorable behaviour no one else from then on should be taken to task? @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 they never do...misogyny lives on, fed and watered by people like you and the phrase "it's just a joke" @SeanHastheMic @regreg187 @jec79 Obviously...can't even for a cogent argument. @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 I don't seem to be alone in that opinion so....I'll just keep it. @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 He said ""You're lucky there's not a fucking vibrator in here" I did watch and listen. @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 As well as being so incredibly immature and juvenile. Why men think it's funny is beyond me. @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 Don't care. It's not funny - not originally, not now. It's disrespectful and harassing and abusive. @Johnnie590 @ShaunSolo That would up to the company and how they want to portrayed by their employees. I wouldn't want to work with him. @regreg187 @SeanHastheMic @jec79 He DID say "You're lucky there's not a fucking vibrator in here" all while defending #fhritp #consequences @ShaunSolo @Johnnie590 He did say "You're lucky there's not a fucking vibrator in here" So that little tidbit gets him consequences. Here's how you teach consent to small children. See? No mention of sex acts. You anti #sexed people should read it https://t.co/lcOErRFhic Dude says "Where else are you going to do it?" How about nowhere, jerk? https://t.co/NjdhlUtxd4 @mrtimchan how about public sexual harassment? in a crowd? on camera? Actions have consequences, grown men should know that. Douchebag. https://t.co/xOLr88GaK0 @shmeghaan Khloe's always been my favourite...I mean the lesser of the Kardashian evils. @melissabeck "She can't do anything." She can breathe can't she, live her life ALIVE? @melissabeck So, if you leave heroin out on your table and your kid DOESN"T swallow it, that makes it okay? 'Cause nothing happened? @melissabeck How I see it - Would you leave $100k sitting on the seat of your car while you "run in"? NO? Isn't your kid worth more? "Shot at" is NOT the same as "shot. USAToday: George Zimmerman was slightly injured when his truck was shot at today.  Everyone saying he was shot in the face? Have a seat Not really shot in the face...I mean it's not like he's got a bullet in him or anything. https://t.co/HeMKz6WcJN The irony of him saying he shot George in self defense....best. thing. ever. https://t.co/JUwkuWYw5Y 'Cause you know we should. throw that "thug" word around now. George is the definition of it, isn't he? Now that Zimmerman's the one that's been shot we gonna be hearing about his high school troubles, what his fashion choices and snacks mean? RT @zellieimani: George Zimmerman has 7 mugshots and Trayvon Martin has none.  So, who's really the "thug"? @elonjames You know you're doing something right if people come for you all the time. /aside/ thank you for always, ALWAYS making me think.

How solid is this relationship? Ever been to Canada? @TrusteeSam I'm assuming the Court meant analogous to any discrimination. I sent you the link, read the decision yourself @marymaggiemuggs @jessmariesibba1Then why do you care? Opt out and leave the curriculum as it is. @caroni99 Omg. I hate it when I tweet so fast that I miss a mistake in someone's handle and they don't even get the tweet. Last in tweet series. @TrusteeSam , it constitutes an analogous ground on which claims of discrimination may be based @marymaggiemuggs @jessmariesibba1 You can opt out..but if you succeed in removing it from the schools I can't opt in. Not a hard concept.@caroni99 @caroni99 It's a sickness I have...sometimes I just have to feed the trolls. Can't agree more with this tweet. @NadineThornhill rocked it! #sexed https://t.co/qqiKpsbjXm @caroni99 This chick is cracking me up.... @jessmariesibba1 Also you got some double negative stuff going on there that is real hard to follow. @caroni99 @jessmariesibba1You can opt out..but if you succeed in removing it from the schools I can't opt in. Not a hard concept.@caroni99 @jessmariesibba1 Not a clue what that sentence even means.@caroni99 @marymaggiemuggs I'd be happy if his brain grew by a cell or two. @jessmariesibba1 Yay you! but don't try and stop my kids ability to learn it. Opt out. (Liberal agenda = my argument has failed) @caroni99 @jessmariesibba1 If professionals in counseling and sex abuse and law enforcement say it's age appropriate, why think it's not?@caroni99 @jessmariesibba1 They are on strike to keep class sizes small and stop funding cuts!! Which would affect your kids learning. WOW.@caroni99 @marymaggiemuggs @TrusteeSam Um...and you talk about MY reading skills...wow. @caroni99 And it's not a case of either/or. Math instruction isn't decreased because of sex ed. @jessmariesibba1 @caroni99 Exactly...one week out of the school year. @jessmariesibba1 @jessmariesibba1 There has ALWAYS been sex ed...it's not brand new this year. @caroni99 @jessmariesibba1 maybe they can't do math or read because of class sizes no EA's and no funding. (1) @caroni99 @TrusteeSam As per my tweets, The Supreme Court of Canada begs to differ with you http://t.co/NzE32KUugL @caroni99 I don't think he gots the Google. @TrusteeSam and I can read fine thanks....you might want to work on your Google skills though @marymaggiemuggs @TrusteeSamsection , it constitutes an analogous ground on which claims of discrimination may be based @marymaggiemuggs   @marymaggiemuggs @TrusteeSam the Supreme Court  held that although "sexual orientation" is not listed as a ground for discrimination 3/4 @marymaggiemuggs @TrusteeSam or ethnic origin, colour, sex, age or physical/mental disability. In Egan v. Canada, [1995] ,  2/3 @marymaggiemuggs @TrusteeSam Section 15  states that every individual is to be considered equal regardless of  religion, race, national 1/1 @marymaggiemuggs @caroni99 Sorry...couldn't help myself. It's that damn critical thinking. I can't stop. @jessmariesibba1 @TrusteeSam Section 15 and in the Humans Rights code http://t.co/ES3Oypjuj8 @marymaggiemuggs @jessmariesibba1 Will you also be protesting bigger class sizes, lower funding &amp; reduction of EA"s? Those do more damage to kids than #sexed @SarahMushMush I know. I've been arguing this on multiple fronts for 3 DAYS. Ignorance is astonishing. @SarahMushMush I'm guessing they learned that from mom and dad. 4 yr old in a library program refered to a skeleton part the kids were putting together as a "pussy". Would rather have heard vagina. #sexed @MishalFZ Since when is EVERY voice ever heard? This country would ground to a halt if that were the case. @CityNews @emilyneat stupid in what way? @MishalFZ @CityNews yes, you were. Parent councils across ON were consulted.
