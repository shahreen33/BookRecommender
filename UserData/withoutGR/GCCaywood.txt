Ok, maybe Penthouse etc @jemillstein I'm a fan of the "Stop Looking at Porn" poster. Has that been a legitimate corporate issue at Rides? @jemillstein @lecook410 Listen I wish you were there to sing with me. But you've moved on and I've moved on to better things.

I certainly hope not, because that would be socialism." via @StephanAtHome #Genius And Dallas continues its progress in becoming LA South RT @AnnaBethBonney @PCMunguia Food trucks are officially legal in downtown Dallas!
