Guess I will @Megin_Akoss who'd you give the offering to? Finn or Hunter @Megin_Akoss do you need a non horse mount to get up paths that you can't walk? #DAIMP , #jawsofhakkon or #elitedangerous I have to wonder what kind of people buy a book by C.J Cherryh and then go on to buy underwear and an ink cartridge... @Derek_Hollan Caffeine free Coffee I wish there was a filter on Amazon to hide all the trashy romance books that are self published on amazon. Or to filter them by publisher I'm now ranked Hardcore (top 20%) in Dishonored on Raptr! http://t.co/yRn0fA2HM7 Now Playing ...

"@iamsparkkie" , "Alistair Tiles" @ToriCarlini @DiscoBabaloo Like Jowan and Lily? @BioMarkDarrah Thanks Mark! @DiscoBabaloo Anders, Shale (Don't ask me how that works :P) @DiscoBabaloo @DragonAgeKeep looks like @iAmSparkkie is hogging all the alcohol :) @DiscoBabaloo @DragonAgeKeep who's the blurry one on the right? Fed up of non-stop coughing. There's something in the air of this pub that irritates my lungs :( Stupid cold/flu... @Derek_Hollan Thanks for all your hard work! @rencro aww noo! Thanks for all your hard work! Will miss your funny tweets as the keep. @BioMaryKirby how do you tell them all apart? @Megin_Akoss let me know what you think of the dlc :) Turns out the @DragonAgeKeep are more fanatical about coffee than @Derek_Hollan :) @iAmSparkkie what's Pho? @iAmSparkkie @DiscoBabaloo  http://t.co/OkoAOVSFF7 @DragonAgeKeep The suprise is that there's a movie of the Dragon Age Keep. @iAmSparkkie @DiscoBabaloo http://t.co/hr0z6zH6yq Thanks to people tweeting about it I Thought World of Thedas Vol 2 was out soon. Still due in may. :( @iAmSparkkie Loghain must live. No excuses :) @rencro I like your reddit username :) So much more truthful than @iAmSparkkie @DiscoBabaloo I think you had better hide it from @Derek_Hollan @SolidSavvy @iAmSparkkie @Derek_Hollan He would be the one to jump after it though. Sick of this cough. Tomorrow's objective is to visit the chemist for something to stop it. @DragonAgeKeep can I suggest @iAmSparkkie as a replacement? @KalliMuse I can't help but think you are talking in some alien language whenever I see the tweets :P @KingMcloud You'll have to take that up with Microsoft and EA @KalliMuse ah. Alas I won't spoil myself by decoding that. Thanks anyway @KalliMuse interesting lore and a cool story. @KalliMuse can you say what that is without spoiling the dlc? :P @KalliMuse Would you recommened buying the dlc? @honoel Your welcome :) Oh, I meant in terms of putting PW ads on your site. There's really not much point watching Top Gear without Jeremy Clarkson. Thats most of the humour gone @Izak_Flash ahh right. @honoel I'm really enjoying your webcomic so far! From looking around a majority of webcomics are still using Project Wonderful Played Elite: Dangerous (PC) in the last 24 hours. http://t.co/ehdUiYJrNH @iAmSparkkie @DragonAgeKeep Ha ha. I wish! Why am I the only one who got the flu. &gt;.&lt; It's not very fun coughing away and waking up with a blocked nose.
