My Sunday will be spent sinking my teeth into this, can't wait! #CursedChild #HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild https://t.co/cAKUoAP1Ce Got my hands on this today, so excited to read it! ⚡️ https://t.co/lVKqLDEmjQ I've hit 4,926 words for #CampNaNoWriMo - getting there, slowly but surely. #amwriting #writinggoals @elynewrites Woop woop, well done! What's your total word count goal? :) Sat in Waterstones cafe with a pot of tea working on my #CampNaNoWriMo goals. #amwriting https://t.co/HcyPrjKZs4 @elynewrites Plantser, I like it! I think that's as much as I'd ever be as well. My imagination is much better fuelled that way :). @HowToReadBooks Hooray for pantsing! @__VanessaVega Haha I have the odd moment of thinking I should have planned when re-reading, but I like pantsing more than planning It's just gone 4am and I've managed 1,020 words for #CampNaNoWriMo - I probably ought to sleep. 😴  #amwriting @tinarussokinney I tend to find once I get started, it spurs on the imagination a lot more than planning out a whole story at the beginning. @tinarussokinney Definitely a panster. I'll start writing, take a few notes down and then come back and do lots of editing. @elynewrites Glad to hear pantsing is common amongst others as well! I write, leave it for a bit, then come back and edit edit edit :) @tinarussokinney Haha it's 3am here now and I'm still up, clearly also desperate to get started with this too! Good luck when you start. 😀 @elynewrites Totally the same here too! I do some scribbling in my notebook but never really plan a whole story out, gotta love pantsing! Those who are participating in #CampNaNoWriMo  - are you planner or a pantser? It's now the 1st of July, which means it's day one of #CampNaNoWriMo - bring it on! #amwriting Nothing like a cuppa tea to fuel a writing streak in the middle of the night ☕️ #amwriting RT @rvedotrc: Our dev team board just showed this.

That's me as I roll my way into June I better get my read on https://t.co/EPfVT37p5O After delving into poetry these past few days it's back to the storyboard. 300 words written for my new short story. #amwriting For my followers into photography and creative writing, please check out my mate Mazzy's superb blog full of wonders https://t.co/C1zEMh3Rib So I wrote another #poem https://t.co/2NYbGdSVlB I am super excited for this, but waiting almost a year is going to be tough! https://t.co/pDaeteBPqp RT @goodreads: All aboard! https://t.co/3iNf4Gpqaq https://t.co/oRlESKqV7G @CrazyRiri Is there somewhere to park at yours? I can't wait so exciting! Any weekend in July is fine by me atm xxx @CrazyRiri Thanks! :) It looks like you live close to the main station but tickets are expensive so cheaper for me to brave the drive :) xxx @CrazyRiri I need to have a look at the easiest way to get to yours. Can you DM your postcode if poss please :). Can't wait either! xxx @CrazyRiri Woo no doubt you're excited and nervous at the same time but it will be over like a breeze! Indeed I need mine next hehe! So I created a blog. Here starts the journey of something new and exciting. #blogging #amwriting Find me at https://t.co/sMoqCZ7xt0 @CrazyRiri Woo I'm excited to see you! I saw the quote on Instagram, I can't wait to see it when it's done! It's your first tattoo isn't it? @CrazyRiri Could we possibly do the weekend after as 19th June is Father's Day and I may be with family that weekend :). Is that possible? @CrazyRiri Is it the Harry Potter one? @CrazyRiri Hey! I'm totally up for a visit, can we make it toward the end of June? That's awesome! Which tattoo are you going to get done? RT @glam_box_beauty: I'm in lip stain heaven! 😍💋 All 7 colours... #lipstain #makeup #beauty https://t.co/YsR55kIuAM @Leventine53 congratulations! Currently reading Library of Souls by Ransom Riggs. #MissPeregrinesHomeForPeculiarChildren @GilbertPaulJ Haha! Forgetting a cup of tea is the worst thing ever! Luckily I'd finished it before you had a chance to sit back down :D. Four more weeks to get through then I can read and write to my hearts content. #revision #amwriting Doing some writing for the first time in a while, always fun revisiting and editing old pieces of work. #amwriting I call this book hangover and it's exactly how I feel now after finally finishing the A Song of Ice and Fire series https://t.co/fFuTBftKDt The moment you finish a book series and feel so lost without it you don't know what to do anymore #reading #bookhangover It's 3.30am and the insomnia has kicked in. #wideawake #insomnia @Leventine53 I love Instagram but if it's to showcase drawings deviant art may be better. It's only taken me a month but I've finally finished A Dance with Dragons. Outstanding series! Now to find something new to read. #ASOIAF In Costa with a cup of tea and a good book. #reading #adancewithdragons @CrazyRiri I'm good thanks, how are you and how's things now you're back at work? @Leventine53 Good luck! @CrazyRiri Well done Rianne! :) Love this fluffy one, she loves to help me work https://t.co/CpWPPC9xU2 RT @goodreads: A noble weekend project.

Do you have any blogs you follow? @Leventine53 That and I thought the Harry Potter Book of Spells was on PS4 but think it's actually PS3. @Leventine53  That's awesome! I didn't realise you could get it on the 3DS, I want to get one of those. And a PS4 Playing Zelda Ocarina of Time on the GameCube, old school memories #Zelda Made it to 4pm without a cup of tea, that's pretty good going for me! #teaaddict @Leventine53 Haha yeah! That and my keyboard is covered in fur, no matter how much I try and clean it I can't seem to get rid of it all XD. So my cat decided this would be a good place to sit whilst I do my work... https://t.co/Vbko1ylGRx @CrazyRiri Good luck lovely ❤ xx @CrazyRiri We're good thanks keeping busy with studying, how are you and Adam :) xx @Leventine53 I'm exactly the same, I end up trying to cram the content in to a short space of time instead of expanding on things. @CrazyRiri Really keeping my fingers crossed for you ❤❤❤ @CrazyRiri I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must be for you ❤❤ @CrazyRiri Aaaahhh!! This is soooo cool! I want one haha x @CrazyRiri You'll be brave I'm sure! The pain is temporary but rewarding :) x @CrazyRiri Totally agree, all the ones I get will have meaning, if you ignore the one I got when I was eighteen and rebellious 😆. @CrazyRiri She really is!! :) x @CrazyRiri Hahah really? Some people just aren't keen on portraits. You've gotta get what makes you happy :) I love meaningful tattoos xx @CrazyRiri I think I'll get it tatto'd on my upper arm just below the shoulder but in a way i could add to it in the future :). @CrazyRiri That's true! Tbh I think I'll prob end up getting my cat turned into my patronus. McGonagall is one of the best characters! @CrazyRiri Aaahhhh! HP sleeve and LOTR sleeve what a brilliant idea! What LOTR tat would you get?? Hehe @CrazyRiri That looks amazing! Yeah definitely make it your own and it would look incredible and a great memory of your wedding day. xx @CrazyRiri Rianne that's such a beautiful idea for a tattoo ❤ xx @CrazyRiri Where abouts do you want your tattoo :) @CrazyRiri I like the idea of cat patronus but puts me off that Umbridge's is a cat also! Might have to wait for Pottermore patronus test :D @CrazyRiri Your friend is clearly awesome!! The deathly hallows is a brilliant idea for a tattoo! Might have to get a HP half sleeve haha! I'm on chapter 9 out of 73 of A Dance with Dragons, I really need to hurry up, only 10 days until #GoTSeason6 ! #ASoIaF #slowreader Watching LA Ink whilst I work on character development for my story. Now I want a #tattoo. #amwriting @CrazyRiri Woo exciting!! You need to follow @HogwartsTattoo on Instagram, there are some great tattoos on there! @CrazyRiri That sounds like a plan 😊 xx @CrazyRiri going to wait two or three months I think then get it done how about you? X @Leventine53 @TVDesignZ Thanks @Leventine53 same to you. I always enjoy reading your tweets and writing. @CrazyRiri The deathly hallows and including 'always' is such a lovely idea and tribute. xx @CrazyRiri So tempted to use my cat as a patronus! The dementor and patronus is kinda symbolic of overcoming my fears/anxiety. @CrazyRiri Either of those weekends sound good to me, just let me know nearer the time when you have your off duty rota :) xxx @CrazyRiri I can also do week days if that's any help :) @CrazyRiri That sounds awesome! I like the idea of deathly hallows, also thinking of a dementor being casted off by a patronus charm. xx @CrazyRiri I've got exams in May but I'm free any weekends in June if that works for you :) xx Totally looking forward to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them when it comes out! #FantasticBeasts https://t.co/APCAYk6i5Y @CrazyRiri Haha this is awesome, I'm totally thinking of getting an HP themed tat but I'm being indecisive! @CrazyRiri Girly weekend in Sheffield sounds great, we must get this organised :P. @CrazyRiri Hey Rianne! Yes we must arrange to meet up soon! No worries about not replying, how are you doing? xx @goodreads Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi @Leventine53 Harry Potter, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Zelda Ocarina of Time, a selection of comics. @Leventine53 @BrentMcCluskey Snap, I'm a Ravenclaw too. @Leventine53 Harry Potter is definitely one of the best book series of all time. I've yet to read The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Where do you get your inspiration from #amwriting #amediting #inspiration #progress Tea, laptop and writers journal at the ready. It's time to get some words down. #amwriting #amreading #amediting @Leventine53 Good afternoon 1:30am and I'm still up...really shouldn't have drank so much tea today #teaaddict #wideawake #cantsleep @LJSilverman A fellow #spoonie here, hope the pain has lessened. @Leventine53 That's definitely where it belongs right now!
