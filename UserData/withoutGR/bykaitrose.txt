I appreciate RTs https://t.co/… Keep these things in mind before you grab an extra copy to help yourself gain followers. We may not always be lucky enough to attend ALA. The amount of giveaways and people putting up ALA ARCs on #booksfortrade honestly makes me ashamed of this community. Those extra copies are there for librarians who are in panels and may not have had the chance to make it to the exhibit hall yet. We need to keep that in mind. If they have extra ARCs of books lying around, they aren't to take and giveaway or trade. I'm gonna talk for a minute about ALA. ALA is an event bloggers are lucky enough to attend.
