I am beginning to think that all Twitter users with numerals in their name are spambots. Trying to get more motivated. Finished with some yard work, now shower, then off to buy a new motorcycle. My neck is sure hurting today, must have slept wrong. Twitter posts seems to becoming more few and far between lately. Is this a sign of imminent demise or some other unconsidered factor? Time to get some work done. Attempted to clean the desk and lost the battle. Anyone using brightkite through Ping.fm? Are there any benefits? Crazy in-laws. Getting ready for dinner. Trying something new, BBQ chicken wraps. Hope they are good. Thinking about CMSs...Contemplating content Just finished dinner with the family and scored some building materials that I have been looking for for months, hidden in a home depot. Ping.fm a service for mass communication. @1938media nothing more than you deserve, but that is just my opinion. Comes around, goes around.
