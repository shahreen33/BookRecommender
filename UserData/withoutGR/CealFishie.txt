God already provided 1. If you won't take His word for it, whose will u take? .@LadyBugz528 Honey, you are twisting everything around so you can consider it invalid. One day your assuaged conscience won't matter. .@LadyBugz528 That's not its full name, is it. :) It was the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. .@LadyBugz528 Now you're just being silly. .@LadyBugz528 We aren't. Adam &amp; Eve were perfect. They still had free-will. They chose to sin. We inherited the mess. .@LadyBugz528 How does knowing = controlling? Now your definitions aren't matching up. ;) .@LadyBugz528 I meant He saw Jesus taking on the guilt/sin of the world &amp; let Him take the penalty (death) even though He was innocent. .@LadyBugz528 They are forgiven for each individual as they ask for forgiveness. There's no blanket forgiveness. .@LadyBugz528 Jesus was already an entity in heaven before He came to earth. There was no embryonic decision. .@LadyBugz528 None you would consider evidence. Why does there have to be a before life if there's an after life? .@LadyBugz528 You're an atheist. Atheists believe there's no God. You can't actually prove there is no God. Thus you have faith there isn't. .@LadyBugz528 No, God doesn't make anything imperfect. He made humans perfect. We messed everything up w/ sin. .@LadyBugz528 He didn't "control His every action." Jesus wasn't a robot or a slave. .@LadyBugz528 Whoa, whoa. Something got lost in translation. Jesus could accept punishment for whole world's sin because He was innocent. .@LadyBugz528 I'm getting there. :) Just tell me why you don't believe there is a real Zeus. .@LadyBugz528 Yes! And His Son came willingly because He loves mankind! .@LadyBugz528 Can I ask you a question? Why is it important to you that there is no God? .@LadyBugz528 God allows humans to make choices, good or bad. Consequences always follow. If not in this life, always in the next. .@LadyBugz528 Disbelieving something is believing its opposite. So you believe there is no God, which you have no evidence for, thus faith. .@LadyBugz528 He was also separated from His Father by the sin. For that time God looked at Jesus as guilty though He was innocent. .@LadyBugz528 Suffering death (penalty for sin) was only part of the sacrifice. He also bore the crushing weight of the sins of the world. .@LadyBugz528 Okay. I'll play. Just for funsies: why don't you believe that there is a real Zeus? .@LadyBugz528 Of course not. I'm not sure how this relates to anything we've been discussing? .@LadyBugz528 Exactly! You can't prove that God doesn't exist. .@LadyBugz528 "Atheist: One who disbelieves or denies the existence of God or gods." http://t.co/oyyYcqT1 You agree w/ this dictionary def.? .@LadyBugz528 If I'm wrong, none of the other religions offer any hope anyway.

But the Bible's God came down to us, lived among us as a man (so He can empathize w/ us) &amp; died for us.(2/2) .@LadyBugz528 I could show you how in every other religion either there is no God or the god requires humans to attain to some level...(1/2) .@LadyBugz528 Ah. I wish I could have this convo in person. 140 characters is so constraining. .@LadyBugz528 So are you agreeing that there may be a God albeit one you don't agree with? .@LadyBugz528 Belief = faith = trust. Yes? They are listed as synonyms in my dictionary. .@LadyBugz528 ok. .@LadyBugz528 If God doesn't exist you'll have everything to lose because you've lived like He doesn't. (2/2) .@LadyBugz528 If God exists I'll have nothing to lose because I've lived like He does. (1/2) .@LadyBugz528 It was about people he doesn't agree w/ in general. You just happened to be most recently on the receiving end. .@LadyBugz528 Wasn't talking to you. :) .@LadyBugz528 You believe there is no God, correct? Then you have faith there is no God. There's really no way to prove one doesn't exist. .@LadyBugz528 First you defined faith incorrectly. Any time you believe something (w/ or w/out scientific / material evidence) that's faith. .@syvyn11 I'm not meaning to argue w/ you, but fight the evil not those enslaved by it. They are blind to their bondage. Be merciful. .@syvyn11 Sir, you have a very un-Christlike attitude toward ppl who don't agree w/ you.
