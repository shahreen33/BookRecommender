It's pissing me the fuck off! /endrant Terrorism only adds fuel to the fire of racism, providing white supremacists with 'proof' that their own xenophobic hatred is justified. (c) Especially with Judaism, Christianity and Islam: it's the same deity! Just a different name and a different way of worshipping it! (c) If you honestly believe you can justify killing random people because of some sense of religious superiority, you're stupid, imho. (c) What terrorists do is spread intolerance. Hate. Ignorance. Pain. Suffering. Stupidity. (c) The thing with terrorism is that its aim is to instill fear. It's why it is called 'terrorism'. This is not just related to today's attacks.

Although that might be my buzz talking It's worth noting that the same guy was already pretty annoying when he got on the bus in the first place On my way home after alumni meeting and drinks, slightly tipsy, and some Chinese guy on the bus keeps humming annoyingly. I suck at parking so obviously there are only tricky spots available. Works wonders on my mood and temper *screams* @Miss_Karen85 just read the last chapter. Loved it!
