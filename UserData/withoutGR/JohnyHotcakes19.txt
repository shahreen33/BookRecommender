Ugh. @JohnyHotcakes19 sorry if I offended you I'm just annoyed that people lowball stuff like that. Esp when I put price firm. @specialk3483 lol well I feel like that's different. This is a Nike hoodie that was originally $75 and I would only get $10 when I paid $45. It still baffles me how cheap people can be. I'm selling something I paid $45 for, for $22 and you come in and ask $13 for it. Ugh. It's too cloudy here to see the super moon 😫 @specialk3483 oh good! Cause seriously I'm like meh Don't get me wrong, I love the story and I think Emma looks amazing, it's just something about the beast that rubs me the wrong way. Am I the only one who isn't super excited for Beauty and the Beast? Please, sorry, and thank you go a long way. @1Lavishone let's hope so :) @1Lavishone apparently that's an ancient art form. @1Lavishone totally! It can be contagious if we allow it to be. @1Lavishone agreed. And it's usually the little things that make all the difference. @1Lavishone it's seriously crazy to me how rude people are. I love when people have to shove you out of the way to get on the train. Then when they get on, they block the way so you can't get on. It's only 42 out I guess we don't need to have the heat on in the trains yet 😖 Sometimes you just need a reminder. https://t.co/qhXCDW9F1e @lisazj1 yes she was great! @lisazj1 I still love her, and I love their snarkiness towards each other.

I mean it was but it was quick lol @lisazj1 what do you think of this one? @Dotsshe I feel you. Axel was so upset when the woman didn't win 🙁 @DebbieCDC for sure in this case!!! I honestly never thought I would see it. After the Indians tied it, I was defeated. @DebbieCDC I took 145 pictures cause I just kept snapping and didn't stop lol @DebbieCDC amazing and quick. I feel like I blacked out lol @DebbieCDC you and everyone else! I'm still kinda shocked it happened. And I went to the parade lol @DebbieCDC I've been crying for 3 weeks.

I will always be proud of my Cubs. 97 wins in a season when we just had 100 losses a few years ago is an amazing accomplishment. Trying my best to avoid FB today. Despite the Cubs loss, they had an amazing season. Sad that the haters can't recognize this. @pizzahut ordered marinara and didn't get it. Got cheese instead with barely any cheese.
