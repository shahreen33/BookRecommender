(Last three books I started I stopped at 40%) just figured out I have read and finished 89 full length ebooks, not counting novellas, 2nd epilogues and prequel shorts...(1/2) made a nice list of what I would read this week..then started reading something else.

Thx. #fridayreads are Devil in Disguise by @stefaniesloane and The Darkly Luminous Fight for Persephone Parker by @leannarenee Both Great! #FF It's follow friday time: find out why man nipples and leather pants make e-readers important! http://bit.ly/m4mV9P Had a great time tonight, hope to chat with you all again! Good Night all! #armchairbea @book_mistress @harperteen new covers are great if it gets teens to read the book, what's inside is still the same. #armchairbea @CaryCheyenneXO @Book_mistress @Bookandlatte @Rachelnseigel I'm following on twitter but it's getting late so I'll check out blogs tomorrow RT @CaryCheyenneXO: Am now following @Book_mistress, @Bookandlatte, @Rachelnseigel & @Coldmoonviolet's blogs. Who did you follow tonight ... @CaryCheyenneXO @Rachelnseigel @Book_Mistress @Bookandlatte Thanks for the shout-out  right back back-atcha! @stefaniesloane It's no big deal,thanks for thinking of me, I've been a fan on FB &  excited to read your book, I'll send a link when review read LOTR when I was twelve and every year after for 10 years. One of my all time favorites. #armchairbea Trade paperback is my fav. E-book if it's a romance with a cheesy cover #armchairbea YES! RT @janflora  I'm English BA too. I write in books, take notes, mark pages. I like finding notes in used books too. Like tattoos :) @stefaniesloane No, no, the story's great and I'm really liking it but it's noticeable. It won't change my opinion of the book overall. I liked Twilight but Harry Potter is another level. In 50yrs we'll still be reading HP #armchairbea @janflora I have an English degree and I remember classmates who were horrified at me for dog-earing books. It's the best way to mark a page @stefaniesloane I'm on chapter 5 and it's really good, but there are lots of typos. (bought online from kobo) I even dog-ear pages just because I love that page...I'm feeling very EVIL right now #armchairbea I confess to being a horrible person, I've dog-eared books since I was a kid (only my own, never library or borrowed) #armchairbea @RedHotBooks You really do need to read the whole thing to really get it! I keep recommending @Jkagawa Iron King and A Discovery of Witches to everyone I meet #armchairbea @jasmine_marie @Book_Mistress oh, can I join!?  #armchairbea @CaryCheyenneXO @rachelnseigel me too, it's fun but it takes time. All the new blogs and getting chance to actually talk/tweet with other bloggers #armchairBEA @BloggerIcedream eek!...actually I could see that happening. Anne Perry had some good mysteries set after the crimean war too #armchairbea @ArmchairBEA @samsbooks1020 @shelfconfession  I like Deanna Raybourne's Julia Grey and Tasha Alexander Lady Emily are they victorian? I've never actually listened to an audiobook, you're all making me think I should try -in the car maybe? #armchairbea I'll read anything, but urban fantasy and historical romance usually #armchairbea Just Started Devil in Disguise by @stefaniesloane #armchairbea If you missed it, Kim Harrison's Madison Avery 3 Something Deadly...4/5 & my little disappointment http://bit.ly/iSPspU #reading #bookreview @imabookshark Ha, funny, I'm following back. :0) thanks. @imabookshark ahh thanks http://coldmoonviolet.blogspot.com #armchairbea @ArmchairBEA new blogs I've found thanks to #armchairbea @littleshelf and @aturnofpage to name a couple.
