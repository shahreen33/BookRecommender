Love should not be assumed, it should be embraced The most important part is that it is a project that I care deeply about and that will be my best motivator. Only one day in but I'm ready. With that being said, I am excited to keep going with this and see where it takes me. Not sure when I'll show what I'm working on yet. Yesterday I finally began a new project I've been planning for a while now. It's not what I normally shoot, and it's not going to be easy. I had a show this past October, and although I was proud of what I was showing still, I didn't feel like I was pushing myself hard enough. I've been burnt out on photography stuff for a while now, mostly from work and just generally not feeling inspired. I just couldn't shoot. It's been a while since I've tweeted anything other than my morning run stats. Finally have a reason to again so here comes a bunch.

Day 74 of morning run/walk: making 6 days/wk a regular thing, got through 5K without a break today for the first time. New 10K goal for June Took all of five minutes until a townie walked up to me at this bar and made a haircut joke. Oh joy. Can’t even go to Panera without hearing Stressed Out, there is no safe haven anymore. Can I put “proficient at making stupid faces at work doge” on my resume? Because that’s certainly a true statement. #work #workdoge Day 50 of morning run/walk: did the dry run for the 5K, was surprisingly not as bad as I had expected. 3 weeks til the real thing. Every single @Santigold has dropped from 99¢ has been fire. Chasing Shadows too good can't wait for the full album! Today’s coffee levels are much higher than yesterday, so I think it’s going to be an okay day! Thank you based @EinsteinBros Day 37 of morning run/walk: finally feel like I’m building endurance, more seriously considering the 5K my friend is running in next month l Holy shit my phone finally finished restoring from backup that only took almost two weeks on my shitty home Internet. Day 1 2016 Got to the gas station before their pumps were turned on this morning after running at the track. Am I really that fucking lame? None of the Asian grocery stores I go to carry Hawaiian Sun guava juice anymore. :( I would love to have an ABC store in IL. #HawaiiProblems Day 33 of morning run/walk: bought better clothes for running outside yesterday, still went to track because fucking snow. Christmas breakfast has been shrimp, kimchi flavored seaweed, and beer. #MerryChristmas Day 30 of morning run/walk: track was closed, 2 miles outside today. Glad it was still warm enough for that because what even is this winter Just got a Spanish robo-call about Obamacare on my work phone. Happy there’s only two days left til break. Coffee and curry lamb patties with curry cabbage and curry lentils = best Saturday brunch ever. Can it not be bring your sick kid to work day today? I do not need this shit. Thankfully I was able to retrieve them from the computer they actually downloaded to but still incredibly frustrating. TIL that my boss accidentally cleared out every email on my account server and prevented some of my customers emails from ever reaching me. NGL super hyped on this surprise Willow album that dropped today. Arch supporting socks are the real deal. Less pain in my legs/knees/feet during this morning’s run/walk. Ready for this week. It wouldn’t be a normal week at work without some stupid argument blowing up in the office... #work Day 13 of morning run/walk, knees and legs on fire. Hoping I start to see results from all of this soon... @SnakPak564674 one of the best things about 4 years of college in Florida was doing that every year. Spent more on activewear today than on magic cards what the fuck is wrong with me @JaredSylva I thought I was under the points threshold but got the invi qualification email. Last name is Velasco, can you confirm the q? RT @AskMrMoonville: Moon Fact #0028: Moon Bingo clubs are the place to be on a Friday night, but they won’t let you in if you’re not wearin… @bandsandmtg More like rolling around at a reasonable pace until my ankles feel like they're going to break off from my legs. Day 9 of morning run/walk, have blisters on my feet but powering through. Still the youngest person there at 7AM. Can all of my friends’ cars stop getting fucked? Just got a text from my friend who had a giant metal rod fly through his windshield today. No brussel sprouts at the hot bar today. I don’t want to live on this planet anymore. 4-0 at #GPPITT with BUG Delver, 3 wins away from Day 2. This whole trip has been awesome so far. Holy shit having byes at #GPPITT is wonderful. Getting breakfast and then artist signatures this morning and I probably won’t play til noon Also Pittsburgh bound in 5 hours. Two byes for #GPPIT and running Delver as always tomorrow. Week 1 of morning run/walk complete. The 2 miles/day, 5 days/week is certainly doable and I can definitely improve upon it. Tfw literally everything that can go wrong in a day goes wrong. No internet and no phone in our building and ofc my printers are networked. Brought fruity gum to work today and now my entire desk area smells like watermelons. Mistakes were made. Put Your Back N 2 It has been slowly taking over my life and I’m pretty okay with that. Mike Hadreas is amazing. Day 3 of morning run/walk and super sore. Also somebody thought it was a good idea to bring a box of donuts to the track this morning... 2 mile run/walk this morning. Gonna try to continue the trend the rest of the week. Seeing Yuengling trucks for the first time in years. Why can’t we get that in IL? TIL that half of my phone-answering co workers don’t understand the basics of customer service...or common sense. #work Just ordered personal business cards for my real-people job.

You definitely have your priorities straight. @Robo_Chandler I would personally go for either epson or canon, they're easiest for finding good paper profiles/most consistent @Robo_Chandler how fancy of a printer? That episode of Saved By the Bell where Zack picks up a handicapped girl from an anonymous teen line and dates her for one episode.

I told @drewrios about it too :P Just to be clear, the overload of garlic is why I am here in the first place. Worth the miserable drive through the construction. So hungry all I want is this Thai food that will be overloaded with garlic. @drewrios bro I rented the 100 f/2 macro L series back in school, SOOOO SHARP. but seriously that is some hot glass. @alexandragarey I intern at the art center about a block east of there on montrose and ravenswood ( at least until the end of this month) @alexandragarey DUDE I LOVE THAT PLACE.

As a combo player he should know better. Come on Eileen will forever make me think of @SailorHarlot and the start of senior year of college. &lt;3 Learn the fucking rules or don't play at sanctioned events, I don't want to sound pretentious but scrubs like that aren't worth my time.

I am mildly upset that the mexican place by my internship is closed today. I wanted horchata but apparently that's not gonna happen today. My ouya is here, and now I'm home at a time when I can actually use it. :D Lolwhoops midnight drafting again, just getting home now.

So tight. 3-0-1 in Swiss, out in quarterfinals of the silver, 3-1 in Draft, won $50 raffle at store. Awesome day at @TheChiClubhouse ! New sleeves for the deck for silver this weekend.

Tell gallery boss you can't work Fridays and will be gone first weekend in August, get scheduled for three Fridays including that weekend. God dammit Vampire Weekend stop being so fucking catchy.

That was going nowhere fast :/ #curatorproblems guhhh trying to write a juror's statement for this HS show and it is infinitely more of a pain in the ass that writing an artist statement. @drewrios I'd like that!

DO NOT FRET I GOT YOUR BACK BRO. @Kylogram I support your Andrew Bird appreciation! @alexandragarey my boss was just talking about this last night, if he makes it a reality I'll let you know! I was mistaken for a woman when I was picking up my lunch today. #longhairproblems Monday night http://t.co/NIOy6evpfK Working hard. http://t.co/Ly4TqCPZAc I srsly play a lot of magic these days. Would not have expected that a year ago when I started playing casually at school. @alexandragarey also bread pudding. Like every other dessert round someone makes bread pudding. LOL WEZ ITALIANZ IN JERSEY AND WE SELL PIZZAS BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD STEREOTYPES YES WE ARE. - This movie in a nutshell. I'm about to watch a movie called "Pizza My Heart". What the fuck is my life. @Kylogram WEAK. Real men use Sriracha instead of spaghetti sauce alltogether. RT @pitchforkmedia: .@yacht accuse big box store Kohl's of ripping them off big time http://t.co/TPhKtTRLvq No I will not connect to you on LinkedIn, because I don't connect to people who can't spell "creator" properly. @GollyAbsolutely I hear that's lovely in the spring! I spend my summers in Funkytown though. @alexandragarey can I be included in that universal cringe as well? 3-1 in sealed today, definitely starting to get the hang of limited. Also pulling money cards = hooray! @GollyAbsolutely right? I'm no prude but that was just kinda low-class. I only feel bad about shoving you out of my way because I'm not normally an asshole to strangers. But seriously take that shit home. #rant Can people at concerts really not resist making out for all of two hours? Or at least not shove into other people (me) while doing so? Pretty sure I just photobombed the two girls in front of me and will prolly end up on their Facebook. Finally at @MetroChicago after living here for 22 years, super excited for Ra Ra Riot! That feel when you get a catalog full of your images and they forget to credit you. Today I'm playing the role of corporate sellout/photo assistant. Because when am I ever really business casual. :P Hooray cheap lunch :D (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/D1gcIbQfKE Oh god the snow. Should probably leave early so I can get home before it gets much worse. Or before my car gets ticketed. How the fuck does brave keep winning awards over wreck-it Ralph? I mean seriously. Awkward bear mom: the movie. Should not. Win. Anything. Sunday afternoon cha-cha records and campaign planning. May or may not include afternoon beer for full swag potential. @drewrios Dude that video is so sick. You should be proud. Nothing says I love you quite like gummy penises in hot dog buns and a ski mask. Thank you @DensetsuFirefox, this package was hilarious. Lolwhoops I accidentally 5-0'd at FNM and won a bunch of expensive shit. @torianne00 but all your thumbnails would be about food even if you weren't hungry. :P Good morning Evanston, I hope you enjoy watching me eat my burrito at work. That feel when you accidentally order the cards you need from a shop in Honolulu. Welp. Guess that's not happening this week. Super early for the interview, gonna sit in my car until I'm only a few minutes early. And suddenly my Wednesday is going to last forever. Good thing I can look forward to beers and trivia at the end of it all. Chorizo chorizo chorizo (@ Los Toritos) http://t.co/UqA4RSwM I just ousted @benjer712 as the mayor of Los Toritos on @foursquare! http://t.co/jRHUvoS0 RT @mtgaaron: We've made a lot of sweet Magic cards over the past couple years, but perhaps none so devastating as DOOMED TRAVELER. #PTGTC Holy fuck the aristocrats just got there #ptgtc Mapo tofu break (@ Plenty Chinese Restaurant) http://t.co/hyPs5h9S @SailorHarlot gotta get some meat on dem bones. MMMMMMMMMRGH. &lt;3 Happy that today is four year anniversary with Nicole but sad that it's the first time in four years we've been separated on Valentine's day I don't understand the point of veggie bacon and low-fat cheeses. If you want to eat cheese and bacon just eat the real thing. I need to stop doing stupid things. My chair just rolled over one of my really expensive cards that fell out of my deck at some point. #FML Nope, not gonna like your new art facebook page because quite frankly I don't like you. Waiting on the head honchos to come watch the video but want food, can't leave until they come by. Fuck. Teaching my dad how to move and rename files on his computer is like teaching a fish how to breathe air. At least he took notes this time. Burrito tiiiiime (@ Los Toritos) http://t.co/gRkih9gx Winter brew! TIME FOR AFTERNOON BEER! (at @dankhaus w/ 3 others) http://t.co/L8FcHTT6 @nicolehates It is the most important food for survival of these winter storms. That and alcohol to keep warm with. @nicolehates make sure you ration your Oreos better this time. @Kylogram I feel you buddy. Rock band ain't the same without you guys. Hopefully next time I'm in town I can stay a bit longer than a day. Scraping the ice off my windshield and windows tonight was yet another reminder that I should have stayed in Florida. Or Hawaii. #fuckwinter Watching this guy make donuts is strangely pleasant. I'm way too into repetitive tasks. #creepin Horchata too good (@ The Mean Wiener w/ 2 others) http://t.co/sr7tXYwl Well. That was intense. And probably one of the best games I've ever played. It's not even really a game, it's an experience. #journeyps3 Can I go back to the desert where things aren't trying to kill me? Can I h back to the desert where things aren't trying to kill me? Playing journey for the first time, holy fuck what is going on. And with that being said I am nervous as fuck about getting into this alt methods show next month. I really hope my buddy doesn't get discouraged about not getting into our gallery's open show. :/  Just got emailed the accepted list. Lolwhoops former gallery member just asked me to assist on a shoot next week. Guess I won't be so screwed afterall! &amp;#9829; Wet Hair by Japandroids #lastfm: http://t.co/1sOufHii amazon: http://t.co/u7U1Zs3T Listening to Sleigh Bells all the time has made me listen to significantly more hip hop. @CicAndDesist I hope you lie down and make a confetti angel too. So apparently everyone on this show is a stalker and the way to get people to like you is to follow them home. Why am I watching 7th heaven still...these people are all so delusional. @wastedwings @Kylogram Hooray! :D You know you're trading right when you come home with new cards for all of your decks. Über trade complete. #mtg #winning Hooray I have a flat tire. And apparently I am useless when it comes to figuring out this jack we have in the car works. Rather, I am wishing I had now because I found a listing for an amazing screenprinting apprenticeship that I'm not qualified for. :/ Not that I regret doing my independent study last year but part of me wishes I had done screenprinting so I at least had the know how. At least empire of the sun is playing through the speakers while I wait for final cut to load up again. Okay final cut, I guess today the keyword clip hotkey is the same as logging out. I can't watch interviews anymore without dissecting peoples' speaking patterns and looking for repeated phrases. #internproblems I'm pretty sure you're the one broadcasting the network "pretty fly for a wifi" too. Nice. Hey girl sitting by the electrical outlets, how did you manage to crack the screens on all of your devices? Seriously take care of your shit To sum things up Waikiki at 22 was an amazing experience and vastly different from my past trips to Hawaii. I also ate so fucking much. I hope if anything from this week i take the aloha spirit back home with me. Because I feel like Chicago took it out of my family. :/ Don't really want to leave Hawaii/go back to real life again. :P RT @drewrios: #morefutura Apparently we are the first of 13 (@ Japengo Restaurant) http://t.co/j0rWBS8N I can finally distinguish between the waterfall by the pool and actual rain here. Glad the rain waited until after the wedding. Lolwut watching storage wars and of course the one time they find magic cards they find a black lotus. Two scoops of rice + Mac salad #hawaiilife Moco loco (@ Ono's Philly Cheesesteak) http://t.co/dpLyEFH0 Cousin's Hawaii wedding was fun, still get to hang out in Hawaii for another two days so that's a plus! So I guess every building here is open air. It's a windy day and I can feel it inside of the hotel. Holy shit I am excited for this. (@ Hula Dog) http://t.co/iebzRLDI Hello coughing guy in the balcony overlooking the pool. So nice to hear from you. I'm glad kona brewing is distributing to Chicago now because I'm really enjoying the ones I've had while in Hawaii. Things learned from walking today: there is an ABC store on almost every block. I mean everywhere. Also trolleys. So many trolleys. I think my uncle would be happy watching tv in the hotel room all day. I however am going to go explore Waikiki. There's a fake waterfall outside our hotel room. It sounds like it's raining all day. Lolwut I'm in Waikiki. What is this place. In the hotel for less than ten minutes, already approached by a drunk lady who referred to me and my uncle as "bitches" several times. @Robo_Chandler @Kylogram you are both ridiculous. My life is an airplane this month at least. Have not been on a plane this big in several years. Hawaii in 9 hours, hope I can sleep through this flight. Herbal Essences needs to stop discontinuing my conditioners. This is strike two. #longhairproblems Also, I shouldn't have to remind you but I'm not going to photograph interiors anymore. I don't need advice on that. #photodadproblems Oh Dad, I appreciate your effort but I know how flashes work. You don't have to explain it to me. STEVE HOLT Also last day of internship part 1. Boss has been in meetings all day, really want to ask about p/t work there. 9° outside, still hoodie weather for me. Good thing I'm headed to Hawaii this week or people around here will really think I'm crazy. Need spicy food. Coworkers think I'm crazy for not wearing warmer outfits. (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/Wdw1xblk Spent 9 hours at a magic tournament today. Lost terribly but oh well it was free. :P Made two sales while working the gallery today, does that mean that I have sales experience now? I think so. @imabima That all looks so good! You might also try Taco DIablo in Evanston if you haven't already, wider menu but similar fare! Wow I've actually had an active gallery day. We even sold one of the featured artists' pieces. And I hit my head on a shelf! Hooray! Something is definitely happening down the street, just saw three emergency vehicles speed past the gallery. Empty gallery, listening to Sufjan's christmas rap mixtape because why not. New record for longest gap between initial response to craigslist posting and reply from the poster: 7 months Chili dog and horchata, why the fuck not? (@ The Mean Wiener) http://t.co/mlECNNCf Mind your own business, you are not the carry-on luggage police, asshole. Some of us just have two small bags and it's not in your way. @Kylogram nope, just a strange random encounter. Can't wait to board this plane and pass out for two hours. Did not get enough sleep last night and have had minimal caffeine today. @Kylogram no such luck here, flying through a business terminal and there's only a bar to order food from. Had the most overpriced airport lunch ever today. See you again soon, NY. Yay two hour wait til flight because of weather. @Kylogram positive, he stated at me while I walked through the door and is now sitting directly behind me. There is some dude staring at me through the window at Starbucks and he is freaking me the fuck out. Listening to these women talk make me glad that they're not my parents. Oh my god you new yorkers need to shut the fuck up. You are not the only people in this restaurant. Stop laughing. Stop talking. Lunch special while Nicole interviews elsewhere in town. (@ King and I) http://t.co/6D52ICvQ Nice decor, strange mix of american and Chinese fare. Yay anniversary lunch :) (@ Baumgart's Cafe) http://t.co/13ycPoQJ All I want is a good thai lunch special and I can't even determine if the one thai restaurant here is still operating. Trying to find lunch in this mountain town area is such a pain in the ass, can I just be in Ravenswood now so I can go to Roong Petch? Really? Brave? Not gonna happen at the Oscars. Wreck-It Ralph was so much better, and had 100% less awkward bear mom. Beer beer beer beer beer (@ Defiant Brewing Co.) http://t.co/Dg9HpQXb Wheeeee empty stomach drinking #tipsy @nicolehates same, I only use mine when i'm at work or traveling, more specifically the last two weeks. @nicolehates mine literally screams at me when I do anything that uses more memory than listening to music. Laundromat adventure with NY lottery funtimes included. Quick draw forever. Saved by the bell &gt; boy meets world, Zack + Kelly &gt; Corey + Topanga. sorry but it's the truth. #hatersgonnahate #90s @alexandragarey Nicole got me sick earlier this week. It's only a matter of time when you're taking care of your S.O., don't feel too bad. BEAR MOUNTAIN First @SamuelAdamsBeer Alpine Spring of 2013 and it is just as perfect as I remember it from last year. :D @torianne00 MY MOM DID THE SAME THING TO ME WHEN I HAD MINE PULLED. Seriously. Torture. @Kylogram Your lyrical tweets today have been exceptional. :D This laptop still has squatter's rights forms in the downloads folder... lolwut. I guess I really never use this thing. Traveling back down to NY from the cape today. January is just going to last forever. @Kylogram DAAHHHHDEHHHLAHHHDEHHHHH Cape Cod elderly folk circle. They're all reminiscing about the olden times, I am so lost. :P Train ride to the Cape, free wifi, drowning out all the Connecticut with Sleigh Bells and Deerhoof, possibly some Neon Indian soon. Got the worst pressure headache on the plane, still feeling slightly motion sick from the landing. Hope this passes soon. :/ First goal: make sure I can store my backpack in the overhead. Because people bringing bags that are too huge on the plane is an issue. It's still early enough that the sun isn't up. Arriving in New York in just a few hours. And this early flight looks full. My car did a 180 today on the way home...why do you all like the snow again? I don't really like it when it spins my car out.  #fucksnow Oh fuck I have to walk to my car after this and dust all the fucking snow off before I can go home. But seriously can someone please bring me a tasty beverage? Preferrably from @argotea I will love you forever! @wastedwings That would be awesome! Hope Texas is treating you well for now at least. INCENTIVE: You get to listen to all my favorite JAMZ with me. And I will buy you tea if you bring some for both of us. I don't think any of my followers on here is local, but if someone wants to come to the gallery and bother me that would be awesome. :D XANGA'S THERE TOO! WELL FUCK. Guess when I started college I wanted to blog every moment of my life still. That moment when you realize your laptop is old enough to still have LiveJournal in the main bookmarks bar. #loliwasanangstyteenageblogger Just feel bad that the reason he's coming is to drop off my laptop charger so I don't go crazy sitting here for six hours... I'm pretty certain my dad has never actually visited the gallery I am a member of. Guess this will be a first for him today. @alexandragarey Thankfully for you it's only a holiday away...seeing Nicole for the first time in 5 months on Friday, only get 2.5 weeks :/ Worst. Bartender. Ever. Where is our regular bartender who knows what she's doing? #firstworldproblems @CanonMistress pulled the most expensive card in the current set and a shockland. :D you'd hate them both, they're blue cards. :P I didn't realize there were actually people getting bitter about the results of #NextIronChef, I don't see why, Alex earned her win fairly. &amp;#9829; Hem of Your Garment by Cake #lastfm: http://t.co/UGb5LnZk Gonna sell them for store credit tomorrow anyway, cuz I'm gonna be gone for a long while after this week. I would tweet about the Magic cards I pulled today, but I don't think any of my followers play Magic :P $104 in winning lottery tickets today... Hooray i'm not as broke as I was expecting to be! OH NOES YOUR BRITISH ASSISTANT IS GAY ON CHRISTMAS WHATEVER SHALL YOU DO OLD MAN? Seriously what the fuck am I watching. Why yes, animated falling money overlays should be implemented MORE in cinema. Thank you awful lifetime movie network holiday movie. @nicolehates watch the hallmark channel much? It's all "family" movies where someone either dies or has some sort of debilitating illness. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME WE HAVE HAWAIIAN BREAD. :D My friends got me Kahlua and an inflatable bowling alley for Christmas :D Too bad it's too cold to set it up and I'm sick so I can't drink Sad to see @amandafreitag lose, but @guarnaschelli kicked ass all season and totally earned her title. &lt;3 the #Chopped judges #NextIronChef RT @guarnaschelli: Chili peppers are like little time bombs #TEAMCHOPPED #NextIronChef WHAT WHAT CHOPPED JUDGES FTW I'm happy with any of these three winning, but... #TeamAmanda #NextIronChef Considering leaving late to see friends tonight to watch the #NextIronChef finale...or maybe I should just avoid twitter until I watch it. @CicAndDesist YES I WANT THIS TOO LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN I think all the other breaking bad fans got to the candy store before I did, no blue raspberry rock candy. Went with cotton candy flavored @guarnaschelli Just finished watching because of your tweets. What a beautiful film and an amazing chef. Finished wrapping presents, hope my one friend doesn't mind that part of his gift is a potato. Going to kick this cold in the ass with Airborne and lemon tea all day. @CicAndDesist Glad you did, I didn't feel the same when I got back from Miami. @CicAndDesist BUHHH need to catch up with all of Season 3 before next month. SO EXCITED. @alexandragarey Hahahaha I'm honestly happy with any of the top 3, they were my top picks from the beginning. :P @alexandragarey you can always join #TeamAmanda with me! @alexandragarey RIGHT? the past few episodes have been so freaking hard to watch. The finale is going to kill me. @alexandragarey I want to meet the people who think this is a good idea. And possibly work there so I can make these ridiculous images too Every beer I try from @RevBrewChicago is continuing to be fantastic. Workingman Mild at the brewpub last week, Fistmas in the burbs tonight. It has been a while, they have beer flights now. :D (@ Tap House Grill) http://t.co/4ka6q6B7 Hoping for quick service today, but can never tell. Just really wanted soup and spicy food. (@ Roong Petch) http://t.co/bNkFCyTC Babysitting my drunk friends tonight because I brought the car. Trying to convince them to drink water is a challenge. TOTALLY CALLED IT. My top three picks from the start are now the Top three finalists. #TeamChopped #NextIronChef @alexandragarey Same! Saw them when they were doing Projekt Revolution, and then again on their 10th anniversary tour for the first album. @alexandragarey YES. Why am I just finding this out about you now? I would have invited you to come with me to their Chicago show in october @alexandragarey even with one we would prolly overchurn it and Ted Allen would chop us for it. Cuz those machines are difficult. @nicolehates pun intended? GET IT? CUT OUT? Lololololololololololol @alexandragarey @nicolehates THIS SO MUCH. Case and point, Paul's dogs: awkward family of adorableness. My dad's friend is so fucking annoying. Just give me all your money for the website I made you. Oh well, time to hang out with the assorted beers that are still in my fridge. #fuckpeople Friends cancelled plans because of Hobbit tonight, and magic playing friend is playing with other people tonight. There goes my plans... I am within five hours of finishing my internship. Holy crap. What am I going to do with myself after next week? #hireme I just unlocked the "Shutterbug" badge on @foursquare for adding photos to my check-ins. Say cheese! http://t.co/yD35DRxs This place is so cool. (@ Revolution Brewing w/ 4 others) [pic]: http://t.co/L9SeVHdu @lalamb81 30 ROCK IS SO GOOOD. It only gets better. Also their final season is totally better than the office final season. Lunch break while laptop charges at work, continuing to explore the lunch special here (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/4ADPbKen @alexandragarey If you look on the applications page they're looking for amateurs for a special episode...I mean it wouldn't hurt to apply @drewrios also I'm still wearing shorts until I actually get home. :P @drewrios please no, I'm coming back from florida today and it would suck to go from 80° and humid as fuck to freezing and snowing. :P Why the fuck do you need an MBP to run chrome and TextEdit? Because according to your dock you don't run anything else. #airportjudging @Kylogram at least Atlanta has the weird underground train thing, makes it a little easier. I have spent far too much time in the Atlanta airport recently. Either checked luggage prices need to go down or people need to bring less shit with them onto the plane. This jetway lineup is ridiculous. This weekend also acted as a reminder of how awesome my Ringling friends are and how much I needed a weekend away from people at home. It's been a good break from Chicago and another busy Basel weekend. Hoping that I can do this again next year. Until next time, Sarasota. (@ Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ)) http://t.co/3L0qeBHd Just say "free drinks at my house on this night, here's my address". Done. That would be easier than me reading your stupid poem. Why do people still like making up stupid new versions of twas the night before Christmas for mass emails? This is why I don't like you. @GollyAbsolutely DUDE I used to know those as well! It's since left me unfortunately, but I can pick out bits and pieces. Also, Sauerkraut. Five years in a row. (@ Pizza Fiore) http://t.co/qVCGAse8 Good to be back (@ Aqua Art Miami - Aqua Hotel) http://t.co/GYWOZpMc Having a very hard time loading videos of moaning radishes. #moaningradishes In my happy place :D (@ Pollo Tropical) http://t.co/MwSGSWyy First show of the day! (@ Scope Miami 2012) http://t.co/Emed1YQF I just unlocked the "Warhol" badge on @foursquare! Gallerific! http://t.co/VHUVGuG0 So let's see, gif exhibition, free beer, meeting Dan deacon, going to food truck festival. Good first night in Miami! Sushi tiiiiiime (@ Suvi Thai Sushi) http://t.co/9TW1Nzzm @Kylogram in Miami til Sunday, but Sunday might be okay! Depends on when I get back/how tired we all are. This whole trip is just surreal. Having not left IL for half a year and only stopping through Ringling for a day has been really weird. Being back in Sarasota has been strange. Good to see old friends/employers, but ready for Miami. #ABMB I see you judging me with your judging eyes, elderly woman at my gate. Spoke too soon, there he goes again. #shutupdude Hooray, the dude at my gate who was talking very loudly on his phone finally hung up! Now just a few minutes until boarding. :D Actually have most of my stuff ready to be packed for tomorrow. SRQ tomorrow, Miami on Friday. Looking forward to a break from IL. I just ousted @nancy_geden as the mayor of Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries on @foursquare! http://t.co/dthZj9LI Burger time (@ Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries) http://t.co/Q77dAb2C Best lunch break spot ever. Can't wait for my giant burrito (@ Los Toritos) http://t.co/peOdwEUF Sometimes I forget that my dad was a figure skater in the 60's...and also a greaser...still not sure how that worked out. @jeremydfisher SERIOUSLY! I just helped my friend build an IKEA bed frame and desk last weekend. Following those instructions takes skill. As much as I am enjoying Chicago craft beer, my upcoming trips to the east coast will definitely require local craft beer. I've been noticing while re-watching the Office that Michael is a fan of Yuengling Black &amp; Tan. Looking forward to east coast beer again. Who knew that leather jackets and early 20's angst in airports were still so popular in Canada! Every so often I get updates on FB from my friend who grew up to be part of a crappy Canadian pop-rock band. Then i watch their videos... RT @ebaynetflix: Here is a new album of my first ever dj style release. Wish Book Volume 1. Hope you enjoy it! https://t.co/PYJm1eqq RT @pitchforkmedia: Listen: Dan Deacon releases epic mash up mix. Watch out, Girl Talk http://t.co/hyzEKl5P Get most of the way through a job application, crappy internet can't upload your PDF portfolio, error occurs, have to start over. #FML I just heard him screaming because the batteries in his camera died. His camera uses AA batteries. Apparently he thinks batteries are stupid My dad really needs to jump in a time machine to go back to the 60's when there was no digital. All technology really frustrates him. @drewrios And if all else fails go black and white and hope for the best. :P @drewrios Also as far as WB is concerned ACR 7.0 includes color temp in their local adjustments, so it is possible to adjust screens in RAW. @drewrios It's generally better (and easier) to pull the highlights down than it is to brighten shadows with RAW. So shoot high, pull down. Holy crap the curse continues. #NextIronChef Falkner has the advantage of destroying in these rounds...but this is really coming down to an under/over decision. #NextIronChef These secret ingredient rounds are getting harder to watch every week. #NextIronChef #TeamAppleman #TeamChopped Ohhhhhhh mannnnnn this is a scary final round. Appleman vs. Falkner? Sorry @alexandragarey but I'm going #TeamAppleman tonight. Sausage mousse....chef appleman you are crazy. #NextIronChef NATE YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN 20 ON THE EGGS GAHHHHH Mehta would have been SCREWED with 15 on that mortadella. #NextIronChef It's that time again! #NextIronChef #TeamChopped GO CHEF AMANDA! First time watching a feature match and recognizing one of the players from my local FNM. Good luck Ryan! #TCG50k Swedish Sunday (@ IKEA w/ 12 others) http://t.co/mFRs4gRj It never ceases to amaze me how much my dad hates Chicago even though he's lived in this area his entire life. Free lunch from friend because I'm helping him move a bed today. (@ Glenn's Diner &amp; Seafood House) http://t.co/v8YhM4pY @alexandragarey Where are you exactly? I have to help my friend move to Ravenswood today, don't want to be stuck in traffic all afternoon :P Liz Lemon's wedding was fucking perfect. The final season of #30Rock has been fantastic. Things I have accomplished since yesterday: branding and web design for product my dad is selling, wrote my first stylesheet #smallvictories Also double checked, and my invoices have my correct address listed TWICE. So it's entirely their fault if they sent it to the wrong place. Also, this freelance client is starting to drive me fucking crazy. I didn't think it was possible to fuck up sending a check in the mail. trying to write a stylesheet, and it's mostly working! Now to just make things not look awful. #wishwewouldhavebeentaughtwebdesign I know the mail is slow, but it shouldn't take three days for my check to travel 5 miles, right? I swear, these people are full of fail. I feel so fucking cool when I can get all my stupid little rollover commands to work for my buttons. One of my dad's friends asked me to help him design a website for this product he and my dad are selling. This site is basic. as. fuck. Oh my god final cut just load the fucking projects so I can do work. This is why library file structures don't work. By the way, followers, most of my tweets will probably be about my familiarity with Chinese restaurant owners. I think I will become this guys favorite customer soon enough. Although i'm not being predictable yet outside of getting the lunch special Upholding my mayorship, continuing to get the cheapest lunch special on the block. (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/6PA9VKee I guess becoming the foursquare mayor of this tiny Chinese restaurant makes up for me losing mayorship of golden star in SRQ. #smallvictory Lunch special erryday (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/mA65LVOO I just ousted @tamartorello as the mayor of LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles on @foursquare! http://t.co/veFM5Q12 @drewrios yeah the app is wonky but the free legal streaming and having things on release day is pretty nice. @Kylogram if not Thursday night I should be around Sunday as well. @Kylogram I'll be down a week from this Thursday. BE PREPARED. @Kylogram It's cool, @GollyAbsolutely and I just have too much swagger for the general public. #Fingerdancebrigade A year ago yesterday @SailorHarlot and I built bears together. He built this one for me  Miss you buddy! &lt;3 #BFFs http://t.co/KXlzKbQU Get email from Converse about site-wide sale including design-your-own, still have no money. Need to win the lottery tomorrow. #brokeasfuck @nicolehates she also teaches you how to make terrible cocktails that will get you really drunk in case you are unable to do so on your own Sandra lee please stop making cocktails. And commercials. And TV specials. WHAAAT PLATING TOGETHER? I mean good thing one is in a bowl, but still. #NextIronChef #TeamChopped LET'S GO! I'm still upset that chef Greenspan is gone, so Amanda, Alex, and Nate have to stick around. #NextIronChef I snickered a bit when my mom played "Douche" in our words with friends game. So I'm officially a little bit nerdier now because I have a playmat for playing Magic. Yay free shit! Getting dinner at 7-Eleven because having thanksgiving at noon means we actually get hungry again and nothing else is open I don't think I would ever want to drink a triple filtered bud light...or a regular bud light... Also today I'm thankful for my freelance client contacting me. Hopefully will be all settled by Monday. My family is being super classy today and drinking their wine out of colorful plastic cups. I myself enjoyed a lovely @skabrewing mole stout The last email I sent to my freelance client read as "bitch get my check in the mail P.S. Happy thanksgiving!" except a little bit nicer. So you have time to sit for a newspaper interview but you don't have time to answer my emails about the money you owe me? Really classy. People on house hunters are looking for a weekend condo for under $2MIL, I'm trying to afford keeping gas in my car. #broke Like fr srs I am running out of patience with you. You have a smartphone. There is no excuse for being out of contact for two whole weeks. Is it really that hard to sit down, write me a check, and put it in the mail? Or respond to my emails at least? #freelance I think Thursday I will take lots of footage to datamosh with. I'm still testing the waters sort of and so far I am most pleased. Watching #Chopped all night because I can. I love Tuesday night food network. :D Also finally asked internship boss about possible paid work after it ends, at least I have good prospects if there are any openings... I don't like sending business emails this late, but I am honestly frustrated with clients that have not paid. Fancy pants iMac running newest OS won't run simple video editor, but 4 year old MBP running older OS will...go figure. Goal for tonight: Successfully datamosh video. @nicolehates That sounds like me freshman year, but I also had no kitchen. Slowly but surely working my way through all the restaurants near work. (@ LeGee Rice &amp; Noodles) http://t.co/Y3wiwagh Now have just under 5300 tickets for the nickel arcade that I go to. Still want to get the most obnoxiously huge prize they have. Good to know there are other options out there for FNM even if they are a slightly longer driver. Also yay for trading out $30 in cards. RT @skabrewing: #MillerVanilli MT @dogfishbeer Big beer in craft beer clothing?We chuckled at @StoneGreg 's Milli Vanilli analogy: http: ... @lalamb81 I didn't even realize the red line was updated and I live here... @nicolehates Did you register the copyright? I mean it's still illegal regardless but you should probably email the editor. also link? Bro conference schedule for bros http://t.co/YM5XKqyK @drewrios I'm sorry Drew for whatever I did! :P @GollyAbsolutely I think Anne Hathaway is trying to take your swagger. Someone on tumblr posted recent photos of her, looks just like you Horchata all day (@ The Mean Wiener) http://t.co/bkC04CtJ Chorizo burrito for late lunch (@ Los Toritos) http://t.co/sHTdx9jP I just unlocked the "Hot Tamale" badge on @foursquare for checking in at Mexican Restaurants! ¡Ay, caramba! http://t.co/UxF5ASR8 Playing musical chairs with computers today at work, now waiting for FCP to finish downloading so I can work on stuff again. :P Tonight I'm coaching my dad through copying files off of an SD card onto his computer. Love my dad but guhhhhhhh this is painful. Youtube just brought me to Supermarket Sweep. That show was so fucking stupid and I loved it. Like I'm pretty sure the job I just applied for is going to have a hair length requirement. Fucked If they meet me...fuck societal standards I'm starting to apply for anything that seems even remotely relevant. The way some of these listings are worded worry me... ...am I watching an M-preg episode of the Cosby show right now? What the actual fuck. Was going to be mad about the long wait but holy crap they did not wimp out on the spice. Nicely done. That was actually perfect for me. To clarify by "working out here" I mean working in this area. I am not going to a thai restaurant to exercise. This will probably be a regular place for me if I keep working out here. (@ Roong Petch) http://t.co/i8PN7AKv Note to self: gas station with awesome convenience store attached refreshes baked goods at 2AM. Never seen the racks so full before. @alexandragarey YES I AM ALL FOR THIS. also need to watch tonight's episode still. Seriously can everyone who comes in here just be that awesome? Can every guest here just give me photographers to look up and like my work? And then this awesome dude came in and talked to me about photography for like half an hour. Now my time here is validated :D Congratulations 1PM class, your singer is significantly worse than the one in the class before you. MAKE IT STOP. PLEASE MAKE IT STOP. @delusioninabox Because we love our customers, we will raise your rates by $30 a month and switch your current modem with a dial-up modem! "Oh this is the photography place". BRILLIANT DEDUCTION ELDERLY WOMEN PASSING BY THE GALLERY. @delusioninabox I think it's just because Comcast hates their customers. We used to use their cable and they'd raise rates and drop channels Please don't belt out if you can't sing in tune. PLEASE. YOU ARE KILLING ME. #work #sharedwalls LOL there is a school of rock behind the gallery and they don't know how to soundproof. Listening to children play bad rock music at work. @GollyAbsolutely LOL that child looks so frightened. VICIOUS CAROLING MOB ATTACKS SMALL CHILD WITH YULETIDE! @wastedwings When do you move back to the states? @Kylogram Oh dear. I'm so sorry Kyle. BTW. I will be in town again for a day or two next month. Get beer with me then plz? &lt;3 UH OH TORI IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE AND YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR HELMET YOU'RE SERIOUSLY FUCKED NOW. #SavedByTheBell In this episode, Tori learns that there are earthquakes in California. She's wearing a helmet and packing a survival kit. #SavedByTheBell Also makes total logical sense that since the school is having a 50's dance the gang can magically do barbershop quartet harmonies. All the episodes of Saved by the Bell with Tori in them were so weird. Especially with Zack going back and forth on dating her. @DensetsuFirefox everybody else bailed on plans tonight. New plan is Netflix and beer at home. Lolwhoops guess I don't have plans for tonight anymore. &amp;#9829; Whitby by The Octopus Project #lastfm: http://t.co/vrYMLgnL Actually I think I like everything except the re-recordings from DIYDUI on this album. Wow I feel like such a hipster now. I'm probably just biased because I've listened to DIYDUI like a million times over but still why fix what isn't broken. WHYYYYY NOOOOO THE RE-RECORDINGS :C Oh well. The new stuff on this album is still solid. Grateful to have cassette decks in my room and car so I can listen to FIDLAR's new album all day, it just came in the mail today! @wastedwings LOL it's moreso this huge generational gap with technology. He can teach you how to operate a view camera but curses computers. My father: can identify any classic car on the street, recalls clients and jobs from four years ago, still can't remember what a megabyte is @drewrios Dude! This is really solid. RT @drewrios: I rebooted my blog as a photoblog! Pleasantly surprised at the love it's getting! http://t.co/nam3KReq @drewrios I want to hear his speech but I don't know how much more of this I can take! TOO MANY JAMS! Obama should have added some Daft Punk to his waiting music loop. Get some raving up in that election headquarters. OH MY GOD THE SOURFACE PEOPLE IN BOSTON ON THE LIVESTREAM. So fucking hilarious. Glad I'm going to my internship again today where my work is actually appreciated albeit unpaid. Cut ties with interior designer. Both pissed because no more freelance atm but also relieved because fuck interiors. #work But as long as my internship boss is happy then I think I'm okay. I guess I just hold myself to higher standards than I should. Coming out of art school I feel like any graphic design I do is so inadequate in comparison to the awesome shit my friends are making. @alexandragarey right now I'm rooting for Amanda because she's one of my favorite judges. I also like the critter fritters guy. Cafe was full so $6 Thai lunch special is kinda perfect solution (@ Roong Petch) http://t.co/fkAwb4XE Lolwut i'm being interviewed today. All the bright lights. Ima go blind. @wastedwings Did you know that Guy Fawkes Day was also the lead singer of a punk band on Holiday Island? True story! http://t.co/GATG0rxO Wow, the secret ingredient challenge is like condensed Chopped final round but with an audience.

Busy today (@ Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries w/ 2 others) http://t.co/D7PqDNfN Also shit it's 5:30AM why the fuck am I awake. Well fuck went over my data limit by half a megabyte. Guess i'm screwed for double this month #FML #firstworldproblems Finally have my own gallery page through the gallery that represents me!  http://t.co/zijc1Mc5 Lolwhoops 1211 scrobbles from the iPod. Guess it's been a while. Chipotle serving @5RabbitBrewery beers might make me want to start going to Chipotle again. That feel when that job you wanted several months ago suddenly opens up again. Here's to hoping they like me better this time. :P My dad called me over for help with Word 97...he was confused when he clicked into a different tab in the font menu and couldn't go back. @DeduceMe1296 vern is the best! :D I wonder if the kids like my unemployed recent college graduate costume. Open up box of PS3 games, find my bootleg Gilmore Girls full series DVD set. Forgot I had that. #beingawesome @nicolehates that's already starting? It's been like 5 months since we graduated. Photographing screen print and letterpress posters today http://t.co/eGpnwnpG I hope I don't see you when I come to Miami, because I will lash out at you like no other. You are such a callous bitch. #rant I am flabbergasted at how fucking insensitive some people I went to school with can be. It's not a contest for who had worse storms. @nicolehates that's such a bullshit excuse. I watched that every morning for years when I was a kid. @nicolehates WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HER. saved by the bell and beer got me through thesis. I'm officially convinced that white Russians improve my bowling abilities. Hawaiian bread and my first 5 Rabbit = good end to the evening. Seems like I really like cerveza with Saaz hops. @atlas_nova I WANT ALL THESE THINGS. yay for grace period registration in IL. Voting complete: I know I made the right decision b/c I won $20 on a scratch off ticket afterward! Don't lie,you don't need six pairs of chopsticks, you bought all that food for yourself. #chinesetakeoutobservations And now I wait to hopefully get backend access to fix the mistake. Lol I am terrible with using Wordpress. I need to just leave the themes as they are instead of trying to make child themes. #errors @SailorHarlot I wish I could come do that right now because I miss that so much. :( Guy who looks like Dante hicks just got 37 for his order number. LAWLZ. Great that this on the way home from my errand. (@ Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries) http://t.co/38GwPf95 Starting to plan my trip to #ABMB this year. I am so determined to make this happen. Also means I will be prolly be in SRQ for a couple days @drewrios I look at is as, it would be an awesome pocket-sized portfolio and gives me more affordable access to iPad-only music software Sooo... I think I might buy the iPad Mini next month. Smaller is fine with me, and the price is actually doable for me. Watching Shaun of the Dead now because of @Kylogram and @SarcasticJoy tweeting about it earlier today. #tothewinchester Too bad for Romney debates are based on politics. #debate Well, if winning the debate was based on how many of your family members are backstage, Romney would have won this one! @CicAndDesist Damn dude, last concert I went to that had a pit, I opted out of joining in on it. Because all the sweaty 16 year olds. #old @lalamb81 I'm still re-adjusting. First actual Fall I've had to experience since 2007. Also this @skabrewing Mole Stout is fantastic. Might be my favorite seasonal beer for the fall, a good slow drinking beer. In other news they're now actually all in order by card no. with dividers in between the different colors. #saturdaynight So I have way too many cards from this new set. Just organized out all my unused C/UC shit and I almost have an entire fat pack box filled. @drewrios GAHHHHHH hope you got the duck fat fries! @Kylogram except without the FNM...and the blackjack... Is it bad that I am kinda sad to be missing FNM to go to a gallery opening that might result in me getting a solo show or money? Teenage girls at the burger place talking shit about their friends. Exciting times while I wait for my burger. Because I want all the bacon before I have to work today. (@ Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries w/ 2 others) http://t.co/V7nhtb3U Rosey the Nosey Neighbor: bringing a spatula to a gun fight. #TrappedInTheCloset Whenever I see yoohoo in a convenience store I get all the feels. :( missing my dear @SailorHarlot Have not been awake this early since college. Needs moar @SailorHarlot, at least I had battles on the way here. @DeduceMe1296 Good luck brodskizzle! :D RT @PaulRyanGosling: Hey girl, I just put you in my binder. Romney wants more two-parent households, but he doesn't want the two parents to be same-sex. Seems counter-productive. I might say stupid shit on Facebook (and here), but reading shit like that actually bothers me. A lot. De-friended someone I knew from grade school on FB because he just posted about how "bitches love DP and AIDS". And people were liking it. @DensetsuFirefox I really just need to get to Nickel City again soon. And this time I won't drink beforehand! :D @nicolehates Sent you a DM, tweets still be public. Just played magic for 8 hours. Holy crap these big events are long. #mtg oh also got into another show! WHOOP! Can't wait for octopus project! Three years since we saw them last. (@ Subterranean w/ 2 others) http://t.co/MZDYm0Kb Another super small venue, half the crowd they had the last time I saw them. Should be an excellent show! Submitted piece to library show. Always tough picking one piece when your work is primarily serial. Oh well, we'll see how this goes... Minus a couple of silly mistakes I think tonight at FNM went okay. Might try state championship this weekend and see how that goes. #MTG @drewrios *raises hand* To that girl I graduated with, please don't buy a Mark III. you don't deserve nice things. Because you are terrible. #rant Burger time. (@ Meatheads Burgers &amp; Fries) http://t.co/3UMPHa95 So glad that I manage to get off work before purple express trains stop running. Need some hot tea after that freezing train ride. (@ Beans &amp; Bagels) http://t.co/vKbIv0vS Riding the el in the early afternoon is actually fairly peaceful. At least, it is on the purple line. And now I get to wait for the next one with the clueless elderly folk. That feel when you see your train pull away from the station as you're walking onto the platform. #FML @alexandragarey Your tweets are the reason why I only ride trains. @nicolehates I figured your twitter account name was just ironic because you love everyone so much. Things I miss: Saturday morning cereal and chili dog era sonic with @SailorHarlot. Eating cereal just ain't the same anymore. :C New guy who works 3rd shift at Dunkin missed me...that's kinda sweet but he still can't make coffee like Stacey did. God damnit I miss her. That feel when I realize that all my recent tweets about the new magic set are being thrown in a pool of tweets about Alabama footbal. #geek Internship cancelled for today, draft #RtR instead, draw into $40 worth of cards. Today was a good day. So @TBSOfficial put on one seriously solid show tonight in Chicago. That setlist was practically perfect. #TAYF10 I herd these gaiz won't stand for hazy eyes anymore. I am way too excited for this. I think I left all my indie cred at the door. #TAYF10 If this were any other concert it might be okay, but there are way too many teens here. #emokids #TAYF10 Sitting in the balcony seating because we don't want to spend the next 2 hours in a crowd of sweaty teenagers. Or mosh with them. Working through the edit for the big job, playing a cha-cha record I bought a couple months ago because why the fuck not. @Kylogram Oh those wild roaming packs of women in Sarasota... At least I get to use my free draft tomorrow morning. Hoping to pull things I need for my other decks. That feel when one of your two wins at FNM is against a 10-year old. Here's to hoping next week goes better. #RtR #rotation Remind me to always keep @skabrewing Mexican Logger stocked in my fridge. This might actually be my favorite beer ever. Oh well, safely home again and now enjoying beer and sandwich time. #tipsy Got pulled over earlier tonight because my headlight was out. Figures I get pulled over for that living two blocks from the police station. So @st_vincent is pretty much the perfect soundtrack to me editing all of these photos of rich peoples' houses. #theneighbors #thestrangers “Ghost Town” by The Specials is my new jam.  ♫ http://t.co/EeSzedmr Time to sort through 600+ images from the past two days! #nbd #work @wastedwings Learn up, Kelly! http://t.co/6ogyF1Jm @wastedwings I'm voting Pony.

LOL FUCK I almost forgot Netflix emailed me about Season 6 of 30 Rock being available. Time to watch this whole season before Thursday! @alexandragarey Did you watch last week's episode? Lunch lady Chopped is like my favorite Chopped special ever. Then there's the people who can't explain why they like what they like. Give explanation please. It's not that hard. So glad that most of the people in this gallery are fairly level-headed smart people who know what they're talking about. Printed out fee breakdowns and estimate forms for freelance meeting tomorrow. GETTIN ALL PROFESSIONAL AND SHIT. #work the big problem is that I'm practicing with a bot pod, so...here's to hoping that drafting with real people will go similarly. #mtg #RtR It also scares me how many practice drafts of RtR I've run tonight. At least I can hope to be adequately prepared for release weekend. #mtg It scares me how well I know the words to "Ready to Die" by Andrew W.K even though I first heard it less than a month ago... COME ON SEOUL SAUSAGE! #GreatFoodTruckRace RT @LeftHandBrewing: One year ago today, we released our blood, sweat, and tears to the world. Happy 1st birthday Milk Stout Nitro! There's totally a rich white people party happening tonight somewhere on my block. I can hear their music through my window. Ravenswood art walk today was great! Also totally excited about begyle brewery, can't wait to see them expand out! And once again I'm totally overcompensating for how long it takes to get to places on the el. @SailorHarlot yeah seriously details sug. &lt;3 Damn you NU students discussing your dim sum plans on the train. Glad I only have to ride with you for a few more stops. Well shit, I've been playing Magic for the past 10.5 hours and just got home. Whoops I have work tomorrow too. Starting to get packed at pastimes, less than an hour til #RtR pre-release! spending all night playing Magic.

This train smells like axe and is covered in coors light ads. I guess this is the high school themed train. Well, here's to hoping this train gets me in on time. :/ Morning shift at work = public transportation so I don't have to pay for parking.

Motha fuckin gangsta. @BinnysBev @RevBrewChicago Aww sweet! Are these hitting all Binnys locations? I might have to pick some of this up soon. Today my dad walked in in me using Google Maps and was strangely shocked and impressed by it. #generationalgap @alexandragarey CRAP keep forgetting to mention this. I'ma be in yo hood on Saturday night! Are you and Drew free at all? @lalamb81 LOLWUT you're in town again? I think I'm going to wait to upgrade to iOS 6 until Google maps is in the app store. Because I'm not ready to give up my google maps yet. This week is ridiculous. Two days of internship, two days of freelance shooting, and a print review with a gallery today. Next freelance shoot: LADIES NIGHT IN DA BURBS. Because that's totally what I signed up for. :P @Kylogram Your christmas list makes it sound like you want to join a ska band. I approve.

With all that being said @Kylogram is forever my favorite sandwich and coffee mistress. &lt;3 #ThinkingOfYouBabe This has been a series of tweets about me going to restaurants. Hope you enjoyed me complaining about unenthusiastic coffee asshats. The worst was when I would go to Einstein's daily, they'd see me, and put my bagel in the toaster before I got in line. #truestory I have this awful habit of training food service workers to memorize my order. This actually happens a lot. Oh and I also don't like the fact that I can no longer just ask for "the usual" when I show up and be understood. I have problems. I think it's partially that A. She knows what she's doing, and B. She's not a total grump like everyone else who works there. Is it bad that I'm this particular about who makes my coffee at chain stores? I might take hiatus from Dunkin Donuts until Stacey comes back, these new 3rd shifters suck at making coffee. #firstworldproblems Watching Clerks again tonight, completely lost count of how many times I've seen this movie.

Dying to see them again, haven't since 2009 at Bottom Lounge. &amp;#9829; Catalog by The Octopus Project #lastfm: http://t.co/f3p8zowW amazon: http://t.co/CwBhcpKm @Kylogram http://t.co/9GRWm78H Gonna just leave this setlist from last night here for ya too, darling  ;) Perfect day for a bike ride (@ Green Bay Trail) http://t.co/x3nATZXI @Kylogram Cake just for you! http://t.co/TA3FsAuS Need food. Only thing open is McDonald's. (@ Lake Forest Oasis) http://t.co/EmEafLzM Parking lot standstill all night. Cake was awesome! Now wondering when we will actually get out of milwaukee. I'm at Summerfest 2012 (Milwaukee, WI) w/ 300 others http://t.co/AYH2SHWQ Can't wait to see Cake! (@ Miller Lite Oasis w/ 48 others) http://t.co/59NoTLli Cake comes on in less than an hour! Only had to suffer through awful traffic and a really bad festival layout. MOTHA FUCKIN CHEESE CURDS (@ Culver's w/ 2 others) http://t.co/Pl0OlUFI RT @AskMrMoonville: DID YOU KNOW! Moonville, the Moon is the most visited city on the entire Moon? WHAZOOOO! My good friend and Mayor of Moonville, the Moon now tweets! Go follow him at @AskMrMoonville ! Bitches don't know bout my moon passes. @alexandragarey ONE OF US ONE OF US Finally got my maple bacon donut from Bennisons in Evanston today. Today is a good day. :D Trial run at potential workplace in 2 hours. Holy crap. #nervous People make the most attractive faces when they're running. Looking forward to a long afternoon of editing these Fun Run photos. Pet Peeve: People who walk into my shots at the finish line. Because your shitty iPhone shot is more important than mine, right? My dad just tried to find a text message he received by looking at his call log. #doingitwrong Went to bed feeling shitty last night, been feeling shitty all day today. Had to call in and cancel shoot for tonight :/ Interview went well, going back in later this week to do a trial run. Just need to learn some new software. :P Interview in less than two hours. Hope i'm ready for this... Gaaaahhhhhhhhhh. First attempt at a @LeftHandBrewing Nitro Pour: success! My grandma is so adorable when she responds to the talking elevator in her building. She's in extra good spirits today. :D Delivered the last two Gold Executive moon passes tonight. It'll be a long while before any more of them will materialize. @SailorHarlot a few hours ago :P Enjoying my last @SamuelAdamsBeer Alpine Spring, it's a bittersweet goodbye. See you next year! (I hope) @ninasnail This is why SRQ needs an Apple Store. I did in-store pickup near where I live and I had my computer two hours after I ordered it. Da fuck guys - Campaign for Steamboat shirts ended earlier this week and we only had two people contribute.... http://t.co/DzVvSWRI @alexandragarey TRUTH. I still use mine to scan because my scanner is old enough that it still uses a PowerPC program and Lion won't run it. @alexandragarey Classiest tweets of the evening right here. :P You know it's time to give up for the evening when you use effects that turn your song into demon growls and you can't make it stop. Going to try to teach myself Ableton Live again. Let's see how this goes... I really hope my freelance employer pays me soon...and hopefully the next round of shooting gets paid sooner than this one... Oh my god. Her favorite show is the apprentice because she loves business. She's 17. #priorities Nice to meet you socially awkward math/science high school girl from my mom's lab. You sure are socially awkward. It's really weird wanting to turn down work when I am currently barely employed and living at home. Yeah if I can't see myself doing this job everyday for at least the next year I shouldn't waste my time interviewing. #toughchoices Worst part is that the interviews are only on weekends as it's pretty much a trial run. Merrrrrrr...got an email back and can schedule an interview for this job but I'm starting to question if I would want to do this everyday... I don't think I've yelled "you've got to be fucking kidding me" at my computer this much before. Stupid slow ass garbage internet. First night of D&amp;D went well, characters set up and killed a pack of wolves. Also added one to the list of beers to never buy again. Also totally going to use the $2 discount at Art Institute for the Lichtenstein exhibit with this. :D Holy crap there is a lot of glitter on this wristband. #lolla Gahhhhh wish I wasn't so #broke, got an email about a drum scanning workshop in Chicago. DO WANT BUT CAN'T AFFORD. Scanning forever for Automatic Sliding Doors. @alexandragarey SHO THANG! @alexandragarey drawer is the furniture, I think a more proper term for one who draws is a draftsmen...or an illustrator? Won the tiebreaker round in trivia because it was brewing company logos. Good thing I go to @binnys all the time to buy beer. Failing at trivia (@ Tap House Grill) http://t.co/Z9qvVWDp Trying something new tonight (@ Soulwich) http://t.co/pOl2F7Px Looking at lens sales online, realized that I shot my thesis with a $2300 lens. LOL I will never have that much money. #broke Nice enough guy but I'm glad I don't hang out with him anymore. Ran into a friend from high school and his dad at the comic shop today. Did the midwestern thing and acted like I gave a shit. @lalamb81 And I should mention that afterward these will stay on for ages if you don't cut them off. Still wearing my wristband from 2008 @lalamb81 If it's the same as last year just make sure it's on your right wrist and that it doesn't come off. The plastic bit is what scans. @lalamb81 I'm just glad they're shipping wristbands this year. My print pass had an error last year and I had a 2 hr wait for a wristband. @lalamb81 gahhhhhh still waiting on mine to show up. Anyway I'll see you there! RT @HiddenChronicle: Guardians!

Good thing I shoot on film, no delete button. Mom had graduation thank-you notes made, but they cut off my bright fancy-ass shoes. #dafuck Waiting and hoping that I can get through to finally order a Bag of Crap from @woot, pretty sure their server crashed. New plan for any junk mail that sends me response envelopes with pre-paid postage: Moonville Annual Pass Application. Going to have some fun with this SASE that was sent to me by a certain tech institution that serves up worthless degrees. @alexandragarey Anyone who tweets about food network shows is worth following :) @wastedwings i kept my last one for four years, or basically until I bought a new computer. Now using my Ringling background (1.5 years old) @SailorHarlot Hang in there sug! &lt;3 I hate everyone today. @CicAndDesist RIGHT?

I have a name badge that says I'm a photographer now for work. THAT MAKES ME A PROFESSIONAL RITE? :D @ATT It's a problem that has been going on since we purchased this new modem/router, but has been much worse recently. @ATT Sorry, let me clarify. It's a 2WIRE Modem/Router combo that we're using for your DSL service. @ATT can you give me a good explanation for why my 2WIRE router with your name on it drops or stalls my internet every 15 minutes? &amp;#9829; Friends Of Friends by Hospitality #lastfm: http://t.co/at7BbfVF amazon: http://t.co/0znXT3O8 @alexandragarey And on that note, Giorgio kinda sorta reminded me of @drewrios, must have been the glasses. @alexandragarey WAS JUST WATCHING THAT.

Also super glad that Giorgio won. @Broslife Turkey-o Police Club #foodiebands RT @JoeCristalli: Banh Mi-ver #foodiebands @SailorHarlot WAIT WHAT they were taking kindergarten out of the curriculum? that's completely ridiculous. I find it funny that Taco Bell shows up as "Taco Makers of America" on my credit card statements. 9 mi bike ride, tired and now allowed to be lazy at home. Sometimes I forget that people who knew me when I was a teenager might not recognize me so quickly with the long hair. Silly teens, don't go to 7-Eleven and try to buy a 30 pack of Keystone Light. Salvador won't sell it to you and you shouldn't buy piss beer. @DensetsuFirefox UMMWUT. Nice of the school to tell you about that. I'm guessing it's a pre-college TA?

Posting again. PLEASE BUY A MIDI STEAMBOAT SHIRT! http://t.co/iZ1UdDjL I am hopelessly addicted to Chopped. @lalamb81 So Chicago is just a nice pitstop! :) Ah well, I'll see you in August for Lolla! @lalamb81 It's too bad you're only in town for the weekend, I live in the north burbs just outside of Evanston. @lalamb81 OH shit you're doing a mud run! One of my friends did Tough Mudder last year up in Wisconsin, those things are intense. Continuing my midwestern craft beer education, picked up some Half Acre Daisy Cutter on the way home from today's shoot. @lalamb81 How long are you in town for? @lalamb81 WHOOOO!! Sad that I slept in and dropped the ball on the Passion Pit/GIVERS/Kishi Bashi show but oh well. Can always try to win tix later! Yaaaay going to see Delta Spirit/FIDLAR at @LincolnHall in August! #lolla Yaaay Deerhoof concert was excellent! Greg broke a drum stick during the first song and Ed whipped his hair back and forth. Good times. :D I have to wonder what drugs this Italian composer was on when he wrote "Professor Bad Trip"...strange start to my evening. Just saw someone I went to summer camp with years ago. He's still dressing like a 40 year old business man but I'm pretty sure he's maybe 21 So battles is playing tonight in chicago but I'm wearing my battles shirt to the deerhoof show. :P @GooseIsland Can I enter to win tix for the 312 Urban Block Party at any Binny's/Dominicks in the burbs or only in the city? &amp;#9829; Away FRM U by Oberhofer #lastfm: http://t.co/GGjWyKsS @liliflamingo Fleeing was our option.

I would be so honored if he interviewed me/researched me heavily. Talking to Nicole about jobs: "SHO THANG SHAWTY I BE ALL UP IN DAT FRAME SHOP". Yup. #hireme Okay Bunheads is definitely looking like a good series from this pilot. @lalamb81 this show was built for Gilmore girl fans. It is excellent so far. Same excellent writing. Watching the series premiere of bunheads. As expected its definitely similar to Gilmore girls in writing. Will probably keep watching. http://t.co/8uqbPijt Six more photos added. Please take a look and share if you like! And to add to things to get used to, my RB67 showed up in the mail today. :D Loaded and ready to go! Holy crap ACR 7.0 is throwing me for a loop. This will take some getting used to. #CS6 @lalamb81 I'm considering offsetting some conflicts with pre-shows or after shows, Delta Spirit/FIDLAR Wednesday or Givers/Passion pit Thurs @lalamb81 For me it's this crazy mid-afternoon Delta Spirit/GIVERS/Chairlift/Neon Indian jumble that's happening. @nilaffle For a city that has a large population of creative types and foodies, as long as they follow regulation it shouldn't be a problem. @nilaffle We were just talking about this a few weeks ago. At least the mayor of Chicago is now pushing to allow food trucks to cook. Oh gawd Saturday Lollapalooza is confilctapalooza for me. #lollaproblems If in two days I have to ask about this again I will unleash my fury on the unfortunate soul at the other end of the Live Chat window. Well that was a lovely conversation with customer support. This whole waiting for a download link thing is ridiculous. @lalamb81 Lolla schedule is being released today! We should coordinate ours sometime so we can meet up. @alexandragarey There is an IKEA in the Chicagoland area too...;) A nice one, right down the street from a huge mall. Built-in DVD players are a joke. Dragged my 12 year old PS2 over to watch a movie tonight because the TV's DVD player doesn't work. RT @lollapalooza: Hey Chicago!

One winner a week, contest ends 7/1. #ZyngaLove50 Seriously. And she gives me crap about my taste in television. How many awful phoned-in love stories can you seriously watch? Mom is watching another winner of a movie on LMN, it's about a musician who falls for a deaf mute! OH SNAP. WHAT THEY GON DO? Got another day of shooting in, picking up tomorrow because I decided I don't trust Walgreens or Ritz with my film anymore. http://t.co/PZO3Gl3v Photo: http://t.co/tEm8vmja Photo: http://t.co/hUKqE2v9 @catspells That shit was so hard to get used to the first few days I had Lion. Watched Storage Wars with my dad, and Stewart Copeland made a guest appearance. Because apparently Barry is friends with him. What. Magic Mouse touch controls on Lion are screwing me up when I switch back to my laptop with Snow Leopard. #firstworldproblems @wastedwings Jeez, which suite are you upgrading? @wastedwings I think you can use a cs4 serial no for the upgrade edition. Just check with adobe first. @wastedwings mine was through a special promotion for buying cs5 at a certain time. Gave me free upgrade. Yaaaaaaay my CS6 upgrade got approved! 24 - 48 hours and I can has download! Saw even more people I knew in high school on the way to my car. Most of them were drunk. Already recognizing people I knew in high school here. Reasons why i go to bars in Highwood. People here are awful tippers. Some aren't even tipping the bartender at all. Guh. The nerve. Fixing my website would be much easier if my internet wasn't awful. Fuck it, deleting the website and starting from scratch. Working on a shot list for my most recent project and upgrading the website. #takingcareofbusiness @CicAndDesist hahahahaha of course! your favorite townie! Also lolwut you're in town again? @CicAndDesist Uhhhhhh which one? More jobs applied to. If someone wants to #hireme I would appreciate it! :D @adorama Got things taken care of through customer service, thanks for the quick response! @adorama can I possibly DM you about an issue I'm having with a recent purchase from your used dept? &amp;#9829; Swing Tree by Discovery #lastfm: http://t.co/JCM8PJYk amazon: http://t.co/FKbb5p63 About to scan some film from today and enjoying my first @3floyds Alpha King. Good day was good. Won $30 on scratch off tickets and found Gursky's MoMA catalog at half-price books. Yay today. :D Also, if you didn't watch Saved by the Bell then your childhood is meaningless. Anyone who follows my tumblr is getting a heaping dose of Saved by the Bell reblogs. Because all of you need Zack and Kelly on a moped. Mom is watching a Miley Cyrus movie. Somehow still compelled to keep watching. Soundtrack had Ra Ra Riot and Feist. That makes it ok, right? My willpower to edit these photos is being overpowered by desire to dance around like an idiot to Sidewalk Safari Online window shopping for cameras and waiting to get a call from the neighbors for a quick photo thingy they need help with. Why did they try Teen-Line twice on this show? First time it was a terrible idea. The second time it's not much better. #SavedByTheBell That being said I'm not doing too terrible for my first time trying to photograph soccer. Dem kids run fast. Shit I think I have over 1000 images to sort through today. @alexandragarey Thankfully just one night but one of the longest nights of my time at Ringling to say the least. @alexandragarey Agreed. Hardest thing ever was sitting with Nicole in the hospital last year but you do what you have to for loved ones. Bought a frame at Wal-Mart to put graduation pictures in, and got a new pretty lady to scan too! :D #stealingfacesfrombitches Some of the soccer moms had better equipment than I did today. What do you need L series glass for soccer mom? Gimme dat lens. #broke At least I won't be playing ALL night, I do have work in the morning. (or I could just stay up until i have work and then sleep later) Now that I have CS Suite and MS Office set up on my computer so I can do work...TIME TO INSTALL SIMS 3 AGAIN. Also have to be there at 8AM. Oh the things I will do for money. Another small shoot lined up for tomorrow, hopefully things will pick up quickly. Okay seriously mom I know you hear the phone beeping at you it's right next to your head. Hang the fuck up. Picked up my iMac last night. Can finally stop editing photos on my 4 year old MBP. Well the rain finally showed up. Wonder how long this will last. Good day to stay in and forever job hunt. @LeftHandBrewing Found a place with the Milk Stout Nitro on tap tonight, really glad I tried it! Love the sawtooth too. LEFTIES UNITE! Awesome night, Joy Yee's Noodles in Evanston followed by beers and trivia in Highwood and back to Kafein in Evanston. :D @CicAndDesist Shit bro you're taking off already? Call me if you're back around again before you start working for the man! Accidentally at trivia night at a bar that I have never been to before. Really really like this place. Well shit, won $29 on $8 worth of lottery tickets today. That's something! Awesome, computer fucked up CD burning then deleted the original files off my hard drive. Can I has new computer plz? My dad still watches Secret Life of the American Teenager.... #why &amp;#9829; Sidewalk Safari by Chairlift #lastfm: http://t.co/oW3eyQS1 I can't stand when chefs are cocky and rude on Chopped. @CicAndDesist Keepin' it classy. @nicolehates FUCKYEAH FREE MONEY. Holy crap found two bottles of alpine spring at binnys in highland park. One for me and one for my dad since it is his birthday. :D And so begins my return to Saved By the Bell marathoning. Somehow Lisa buying expensive clothes = "You're a great designer!" Last thing I remember her making from scratch were friendship bracelets. I forgot that the train is an open forum to air all of your weird personal grievances. Thanks people across from me! #stfu Traveling by plane, train, and automobile today. Headed downtown for funtimes with @CanonMistress ! Lol right before takeoff got switched to an empty row by the flight attendant. Now I just have to wait to grab my bag from 5 rows back :/ So fucking glad I am sitting aisle seat today. This woman is crazy and I cannot wait to get the fuck away from her. Sitting next to oversized passenger with oversized luggage. Good luck getting that bag out from under your seat. Looking forward to returning home and getting back to work on important things...like finishing saved by the bell and tweeting about it. To my left and right at the gate today: lady with an Afro who also bought an overpriced sandwich and hipster kid reading Lovecraft. @Kylogram glad you're thinking of me in your drunken stupor, darling. ;) and yeah, that will get you real drunk real quick. That being said paying $10 for a sandwich is totally not cool. That's what happens when the terminal has only one food vendor. Flying @Delta between LGA and ORD is seriously the easiest flying experience I've ever had. @CicAndDesist the none of the faucets are working! Watching Chopped with @DensetsuFirefox, getting hungry again. @Kylogram nah, I waited until she saw me to tweet about it. :P Lolwhoops hopped on a plane to NY today to surprise @DensetsuFirefox :D Only in the 90's is it acceptable for someone to wear a dress with puffy rainbow sleeves. That being said these kids had quite the senior year of high school. Or at least their weekends and breaks were exciting. They must have gotten really bored when they wrote this season, it's all of the really weird plot lines. But hey it's 90's television! AND THE REASON TO BE CHARITABLE IS SO ZACK GETS THE GIRL. #SavedByTheBell Not that the charitable acts are a bad thing, but there's something unrealistic about asking someone to move in the day after meeting them. If Screech offered me sweet and sour squid I would probably accept it, even though that is a really weird combination... #SavedByTheBell @lalamb81 That's the way it should be! I'm still waiting for my foodie friend to get back in town so I can search these places out. @lalamb81 http://t.co/3SGUFRqR Also click over to the menu tab, they have some crazy things. @alexandragarey There's nothing wrong with this. Also just found out there's a poutine restaurant in Chicago. Need to find it soon. #foodie @nicolehates My mom thought mine was sharpied on when she first saw it. Now I think she doesn't care anymore. I feel so gross and sweaty right now. It's days like these when I miss having central A/C. 90º and all I have is a window fan. Awesome. Handed out a bunch of biz cards to the parents, hopefully get some response from that. Spent the past two hours photographing golfers and their kids on the range. Went straight to 7-eleven for water and a tallboy. First freelance shoot for the summer today. Hopefully the first of many, I could use the money while I search for permanent employment. I love how stupidly anal Brody is. I do enjoy the label he has for eateries outside the foodcourt, autonomous unit for mid mall snacking. "Oh ye of little faith, want a cookie?" And now time for Mallrats. There's something weirdly comfortable about a movie set entirely in a shopping mall. @lalamb81 That's okay, near the end of the semester I was drinking Sam Adams with my lunchables. Backing up all of my recent work. Need to be more regular with this in the future but I might as well before freelance shoot tomorrow. Hoooooly shit I am excited about Chris Ware's new book now. #comicscon So ready for this webcast. Daniel Clowes, Seth, Charles Burns, and Chris WIck all on one stage at the same time = HELL YES. #comicscon We've been on a first name basis with the cook here for years and for that same reason he makes sure to give us way too much food. Howdy duty burger at niles grill = reason why a fried egg makes sense on a burger. Also reminded me why I don't do this every week. "She's pretty enough to be the queen of the cheese festival" a girl can dream. :P LOL Harold got all tangled up in sausages. He so silly. Hey Arnold tonight, looking forward to the episode where Harold steals a ham and then becomes a butcher. @alexandragarey This is what you're missing, this show is brilliant: http://t.co/C0q5GzkH @alexandragarey If you get Cooking Channel you should watch Eat St., it's all food trucks. @Kylogram You would cry more if you knew that last week he saw Cake. @SailorHarlot Hahahaha he is gonna be so jelly Today is awesome. Met artists I really admire, hanging outside of a nice bakery with my @argotea mate latte. Perfect afternoon. :D @alexandragarey Living by red line would be ideal IMHO. Purple is mainly for suburbanites like myself but it runs rush trains to the loop. @lalamb81 @alexandragarey Lakeview is also a really nice neighborhood to hang out in. Red/Brown/Purple stops within as far as trains. @CicAndDesist CONGRATS CICI!!!! See you back on the homefront soon? @alexandragarey pretty much I would focus on north side. @alexandragarey Inside the city lakeview/Lincoln park/wicker park. I am looking at suburbs because they're cheaper and commutable. SHIT. Just realized that the new Menchies is going to be right by the gelato place we like. #firstworldproblems Sending out my membership application for a local photography gallery tomorrow...wish me luck! Gallery representation would be nifty. :D Also saw a clone of Britney and K-fed at the Dominick's tonight. Kinda scary. Also lol in a few years kids won't know who k-fed is... Apparently not open yet but coming soon...maybe there will be people around to go with me when it does open up. #foreveralone Well shit there's a menchies near my house. Now I can finally figure out what it is. :P Didn't realize that people other than hipsters still wore fanny packs. Kudos to you, guy behind me in line at panda express. lolwhoops high school kids have hormones and make out with each other. Good job cheating and blabbing! LOL and this episode will be all white kids trying to rap about Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. #ilovethe90s LOL they totally just made Wayne's World references on Saved by the Bell. Lisa has dates lined up with Wayne and Garth. PARTY ON LISA! Seriously. Why do we still have three phones in this house that can knock out our wireless signal. This is ridiculous. LOL all I tweet about now is what I'm watching. In that respect this summer has been super productive! Just need to finish Office and Archer This past year has been the season of stupid plot twists in every show that I watch. Whatever, at least Andy and Erin are back together. Also finally catching up on all of the Office I missed out on while I was at school, and seriously what the fuck are they all thinking? Didn't pass out on the couch watching TV tonight! That's a first for me since I've been home. @alexandragarey @nicolehates SHIT I need to get on that soon too, I'll have CS6 soon but I don't want to install it on my laptop... @lalamb81 SO GOOD. I watched that one way too many times when it was on Netflix because I had nothing else going on that summer. @CanonMistress I know how that goes, but it does make you even more grateful for the ones that do give you love back. Lolwhoops nevermind plans went through and I am feeling much better. Also tipsy. Starting to wonder if I'm still going out tonight...:/ I wish people were better with actually picking times for plans... D'awww, Zack learned how to not be shallow anymore! This has been another Saved by the Bell update because I know you all wanted to know. Sriracha makes all of my family's meals more tolerable/edible. #aznpride LOL Screech is developing photos with the lights on. Silly 90's high school students. This episode is about a chess tournament. And Screech is worried because his competition is a Russian chess genius. "Not only is he Russian, he's from the Soviet Union!" - Valley idiot on Saved by the Bell. I fucking love this show. LINK FOR TWITTER TOO: http://t.co/8HhzoVrS NEW PROJECT, look for "Mill" under Fine Arts. Time to edit dem photos I spent all of last night scanning. #neverstopworking I'm a derp. It was in plain view too. What the fuck. #stoopid So turns out my charger wasn't in Tennessee, it was on my floor. Lolwhoops now I have two iPhone chargers. Now I need a 2nd iPhone amirite? Scanning forever and I can already tell I am going to be spending forever cleaning up these images. &amp;#9829; Sabali by Amadou &amp;amp; Mariam #lastfm: http://t.co/LH1i3b3L Still, a very worthwhile trek regardless of how long it is taking me. For how much I loved Fun Home I am sure I will love this too. Maybe it's just my environment or maybe it's the book but I am finding it very difficult to get through Alison Bechdel's new book... Shot four rolls today, I think I have the start to a new project! But I should wait til I get the film back... @SailorHarlot 9 year olds are difficult period. But you're being a good uncle and a great role-model. :) @alexandragarey glad we're all in the same boat. I too miss @drewrios (and @DensetsuFirefox of course) Damnit I have the best fucking friends in the world and I really need to make every effort to keep in touch with them. LOLWUT there is a stainless steel sharpie on my desk. Oh computer, I thought you were done getting CDs stuck in you. I love this almost as much as the fact that my family has known this for over a year and still does nothing about it. I just love how our Internet gets knocked out whenever someone is on our phone line because the wireless signals conflict. In theory I will get a call tomorrow to confirm that it's mine. I suppose calling at 3AM to ask about it was kinda silly... Lolshit I left my iPhone charger plugged into a lamp in Tennessee. Good thing I have my old iPod charger but I kinda would like it back... Now skype call with sweetie, Bell's Double Hearted Ale, and new Alison Bechdel book. Happy times! Looking at flights from Chicago to Baltimore and the reverse so I have ballpark estimates of how much to save for... #missmybestfriend And best of all some of the contribution is coming from out of state. Home for less than 24 hours and I already need a therapy drive because my family is insane. Kentucky...so north yet still so southern. The neverending barrage of y'all and drawl continues. Chillin in Murfreesboro, TN for the evening. Very likely going to get back to IL tomorrow! @DensetsuFirefox the two have finally melded into one I see! All I hear (and will hear for a while) is southern twang. Sitting at a steak and shake in south Georgia. I don't know if everyone noted will read it but to the point, I love my Ringling friends and I will miss them so much. Just posted a big ol' wall of text to tumblr to reflect on my time at Ringling and the people who made it special for me. You will always be my best friend in the whole world and as soon as we can reunite we will do so. Please move to Chicago for me? &lt;3 I love you @SailorHarlot and as much as I tried to hold my tears back when you left I couldn't help myself at all. I will miss you so much. @alexandragarey BE THERE SOOON! RT @BeerAdvocate: Raise a #craftbeer. RIP. MCA. Adam Yauch. @beastieboys @Kylogram Graduation is a 7PM at Van Wezel. Also I have things of yours to return to you (Your Xbox bag) Still on a first name basis with the presidents wife and saw my dept. head spill his drink on himself. #thuglife @liliflamingo What's worse is that he took all of our stuff that we were still using (I.E. ziploc bags and paper plates). And just left crap @liliflamingo IKNORITE! Adam was just commenting that our infamous 4th roommate left a bunch of his shit here for us to clean up. Actually fuck this shit. Dumped the rest of the can and now popping open a Stella. RT @SailorHarlot: APE APE APE APE APE APE APE APE Or to be more accurate imported beer tinged carbonated water. In all seriousness though how do people drink this swill on a regular basis? It's like drinking beer tinged carbonated water. Lol when did I become such a beer snob. #whatislife I swear tomorrow I will drag him to growlers and buy him a proper beer, not letting him pick for himself. This also makes me question my dad's taste when we go to the yard house (100+ beers on tap) and this is what he picks. Lol why the hell am I drinking labatt blue. At least it was free but this probably the cheapest beer I have ever had, in a very bad way Passing along the torch (and all the equipment) to the next Gaming Club e-board. Good luck DDR girls! Seriously please get the fuck out of my apartment and take your sociopath son with you. You shouldn't even fucking be here. I HATE when people touch my stuff. So as soon as I see those scissors on the table again I am moving them to my room. Tough shit bitch #rant Just finished last test of college.  #WTF I am going to miss the bartenders at growlers so dearly. Just had an awesome talk with Eric about beer, Chicago pizza, and punk music. It is not my place to be charitable to print beggars, and definitely not to a $45 extent that I am in no place to approve. #work It doesn't matter what your situation is, you shouldn't have ordered such huge prints if you can't afford it. #work I will not just "give you a pass" on 3 feet worth of paper you didn't pay for and print anyway. #work Lol all the sarasota prom goers are at IHOP tonight.  Also wtf thesis is over. O.o show opening last night was phenomenal. It gets the people goin! I scored $1,489,006 but Kanye still got in his zone! Beat that: http://t.co/MxrXUiH1 Lolwhoops had two stronger beers than expected at growlers and now I'm kinda drunk. And signing my name vertically on my receipt. @nicolehates reasons why I am not at food bingo tonight: the people who go to food bingo and are obnoxiously loud all night. SO Glad I already got my 3-day for @lollapalooza. Also, looks like Saturday is once again going to be my favorite day of the weekend. @Kylogram pub pass lottery tonight! Totally just wrote an application letter for a gallery.  :D @lalamb81 I'll be there all weekend, we should definitely meet up for at least one set! @CicAndDesist EXCELLENT. I am looking forward to this. BTW we are totally using twitter as an IM client. :P @CicAndDesist I will also accept grabbing a beer as long as it is at a respectable establishment (one that does not have ref uniforms). @CicAndDesist Not surprised at all by this decision :) Well please call me when you are in town, tea without webcams would be excellent. @CicAndDesist I think this can be arranged as a temporary solution. I take it you aren't returning to IL anytime soon? @CicAndDesist Only if we listen to smooth jazz on the cab ride over. BTW have I mentioned I miss the hell out of you? @CicAndDesist I would totally brunch it up with him, bro style. @CicAndDesist And Will Shortz, editor of the NY Times crossword puzzle! @CicAndDesist Please don't start reciting the Divine Comedy in its original italian if we ever end up at a party together. I just feel silly for not thinking to look for tickets to one of their concerts before their Metro show sold out. Not so much a distance thing as it is an I don't really want to go to a concert in Wisconsin thing... Kinda wanna see Grouplove on May 13th at the Rave...just considering whether or not I really want to drive to Wisconsin to do so... @CanonMistress Retweeted this to make sure he gets it :P RT @CanonMistress: @SailorHarlot ITS A SIGN. YOU NEED TO MOVE HERE Looks to be a quiet evening for now. Gives me more time to work on preparing for #lolla and listening to as much of the lineup as I can. More job applications for Chicago and now chilling at my job that unfortunately ends in two weeks. @Kylogram Gaming Club is opening at 10PM tonight, but we also might go to Growlers after Best of tonight if you're interested in joining Zack Morris runs for school president, uses footage of Gorbachev and Castro as "supporter footage" with captions. I will be very sad when I eventually run out of @SamuelAdamsBeer Alpine Spring...I'll probably save one or two for a rainy day. RT @lollapalooza: The Official #lolla 2012 Line-up: http://t.co/2cys6DP5 Watching a talking heads concert and four sitcoms from the 70's simultaneously. Why is this class held in the morning. LOLWhoops filled my phone after almost two years. a little over 7GB of photos/videos to backup and then clear out the unnecessary. And then I turned on Saved by the Bell and Zack called Shakespeare a rapmaster. I love you Netflix. I don't know why you put up with this crap all the time... #rage Slow day in printmaking, and my buddy has been M.I.A. for most of the class. :/ #lesigh I realize it's completely unrealistic but working this full time would be a lot of fun. Too bad print services isn't in Chicago. Oh well, tonight was starting to mess with  my head. Work can drive me crazy sometimes, but I also wouldn't mind keeping this job... The crazy workaholic side of me wishes that there wasn't a 20 hour cap for working on campus, because I really wanted to clear the queue... @CicAndDesist That lineup for Lou Fest looks really really nice for the price. @JuliusCoon http://t.co/IOeT2PCb I need to remember to start bringing a sweatshirt to work, the A/C runs constantly and is aimed right at my desk. LOL 6GB worth of files just showed up at Print Services for Best of. Goodbye free space on the scratch! There are always so many people in the apartment across the balcony and up one floor from us. Thankfully they're quiet tonight... @JesseShadfly Oh funsies! They just had me on a local anesthetic and then put me on an anti-inflammatory and antibiotic mouthwash afterward @JesseShadfly What do they have you on right now? @JesseShadfly I know that feel bro, my mom did the same right before my wisdom teeth removal. I normally never splurge on ridiculous shit but my shoes are falling apart and I want fancy chucks for thesis and graduation. #fuckyeah Now all we have left is awkwardly tall bro who has never been here before and his unexpected tattooed photo major friend. so the bubblegum smelling bitch is gone but her scent lingers on...maybe I should bring the fixer concentrate out to cover up the scent. I really enjoy hearing my boss talk about his kids, and I can hear and see his passion for being a dad whenever he does. #work Eww, the entire developing area smells like bubblegum. #work Finally hitting a break at work. Got the thesis statement at least started. Holy crap it's almost done. Even has the definition for the act of teabagging on the box. And this is for an assignment. What is this i don't even #work Strangest print of the day: a package design for a teabag based around teabagging. Little naked people...and the string comes out the crotch First time in the 6 years I've gone to @lollapalooza that I didn't get early-bird, but at least my spot is secured for the three days! @Kylogram Pub Pass Lottery tonight?

My job is to print, not to give you free paper so you don't have to walk to the bookstore. #work Between the obnoxious mic feedback and your Turkish screaming I cannot enjoy one peaceful moment in my apartment anymore. #roommateshit I know you have to be on skype all the fucking time, but please at least close your fucking door. &amp;#9829; Tongue Tied by Grouplove #lastfm: http://t.co/YVqOeUgA amazon: http://t.co/1U4cMrNE Having a very bleh end to the evening, taking a moment to chill out by the bayou and collect my thoughts. @Kylogram Awesome! Meet me at my place at 6:45. @Kylogram: Still up for the Pub Pass lottery at Growlers tomorow night? And also talking shit about best of during thesis class is not a good idea. I see what you're doing. Don't be so bitter. You shouldn't be saying that you don't know what you're doing for thesis this late in the game. DUMB. #rant Reminded again today that I have some pretty amazing friends. :D And the whole actually getting into Best of Ringling thing is still setting in. I am so glad that I was accepted for this year at least. Today is going to be a good day. Dinner date with @DensetsuFirefox , then beers at Growlers for St. Patties with @Kylogram and others!

Probably should have been napping but well worth it. Gonna totally pass out in class though Brainstorming quiet time. Can this day get any better? I gots a nancy at work today! :D Paleface with Hanna. I am thoroughly enjoying tonight And now new business cards and sticky business cards have been ordered. GETTIN PROFESSIONAL. Cleaned up most of my room today and updated my website. I suppose I'm making some sort of progress with things. Wrote the forward and the thank you's, and decided this book is for my uncle. Wow that's big. I can only hope he will know somehow. I think I figured out a better theme for my book and it's something I can keep up with when I'm back home this summer as well. :D Updating to 5.0.1 through the cloud was the easiest update I've ever had for any of my apple products. Just barely got my wish in there at 11:11 but let's see how that works. @clnhllchunes I don't even know you and that sounds like an amazing two days. @Kylogram I had no other options, I was on a break from class. Never ordering a bagel from the cafe again, that thing was as hard as a rock. @VectorLad This is true, but they usually like if you wait until after 3PM if you don't have a slip. Lately they've had my slip early. Yo mailroom, where's my package slip at? Seriously I would like to attempt to clean my sensor before I shoot today. :/ @CanonMistress I'll most likely be around. I'ma miss Adam like crazy but I'll be up north. :D Fuck you. A little more shooting finished, emails sent out, I think I'm having a productive enough day right now. #alonetime or how much I missed seeing him do his silly dances when he gets into singing something. Happy times are happy and I love my roommate. &lt;3 I didn't realize how much I missed that raspy feeling in my throat from singing during Rock Band with Adam until now. :3 Came to work and found out I had 5 24x36 borderless prints to do. Oh joy. :D Seriously though, feeling a lot better today which 99% of that occurred before the white russian. Dear White Russian with eyeballed measurements: you make me happy. So do Adam and Hanna. :D And Nicole too. Because she mentioned it. :P @Kylogram THAT'S DEEP, HOMES. This morning is starting off very well. Farmer's Market with my sugar pie + shooting for the book, now meeting about possible show. :D Writing down my feelings plus hardcore DDRing is definitely helping me de-stress. @Kylogram We're having normal club tonight so if you want to you're welcome to. :) Up early, chillin in my room listening to Beck until I head off to the museum. I sure hope people actually read Habibi for next week because I really want to discuss that, and with more than one person for that matter. You people are only doing yourself a disservice by not reading these books. :/ Aaaaand where is the teacher today? This is strange, he's never been late before. Rush to class to make sure I get a seat, only 8 people are there already. &gt;.&gt; #tiredasfuck @Kylogram We will definitely be having a Thanksgiving dinner on campus, you are more than welcome to join us. @ninasnail FUCKYES #WoodchuckWednesday @Kylogram we will be here for thanksgiving, not sure exactly what we're doing/where we'll be. But we will let you know ASAP. &#9829; Pacific Theme by Broken Social Scene #lastfm: http://t.co/SNRcjlNE amazon: http://t.co/wTxtLacs Short Big E's break during big print day. Also feel weird rejecting help from the FA majors/lab monitors but it's really not an issue of needing help, just guidance is all. Killing time for now, advisor is running a bit late. At least I think I can get this done right quickly this time around. Have some common sense, dude. If you're going to carry a bong around campus keep it in a bag or at least concealed. #WTF Finished the 2nd linoblock for independent study tonight! Time to celebrate with jalapeño chips and @WoodchuckCider Amber! @SailorHarlot Yay sugar pie! 8'D *claps* Ears still ringing from last night and in morning class on four hours of sleep. Let's see how well this goes :P Well shit. Tickets had a misprint and the show is two hours later than we thought. Did see the band setting up before we had to leave! :D Got a surprise text from @fishertoy this morning, really excited to see him again! :DDDDDD The worst part being that it's entirely unintentional on their part. Also I think I'm officially done with being helpful to other people. My emotions have been fucked with way too much today. I guess I had to injure myself somehow since I'm going to a concert tomorrow. At least this is just a cut. Still, fuck tonight. On that note, band aids and iPhone texting are not mixing well. Awesome. Of course I wait until i'm a minute away from being done to slice my thumb open with a linoleum knife. Go me. @clintthescott @Gebji congrats you two! That's awesome :D Dear food, you will happen as soon as I'm out of work. #hungryasfuck Switched to darkroom, time for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Minecraft. Walk out of bottom floor of Cooley, see entire photo faculty talking outside. O.O Up late, really should be sleeping more. This is stupid. What the fuck am I doing. Sorry, we don't have lighters at print services, but I'll be sure to suggest to my boss that we keep one up here in case you need one. #work @wastedwings BAHHH SO JELLY I WANT TO GO TO BLIPFEST Had a lot of fun at SRQ Pride today, now time for linoleum all night!

Yay comics class. @CicAndDesist Ohai Cici good to see you tweeting again. :P @NikoruV21 LOL I just saw this. Yay awkward! :D At least she made things somewhat LESS awkward afterward. :P Gee, maybe "I don't know, ask Nancy tomorrow" didn't get through your head. Also, yes. Those are paper samples.   #work Someone managed to do all three with one print job. Well done, you are my least favorite of the day. #work Most common problems of a print services customer: figuring out how many inches are in a foot, sending .ai files, not indicating format.

Guess no new rock band songs for me tonight. :/ What the fuck am I doing in Bradenton. At least I got a free beer...? I show up kinda early for work sometimes but showing up 15 minutes early and sitting in silence is kinda strange. Srsly wut you doin gurl.

Holy crap when it gets busier here it gets really busy. #work @JesseShadfly RT @stereogum Watch Jeff Mangum's eight-song #OccupyWallStreet set from Tuesday night here: @CanonMistress Yaaaaaay congrats you two! :D Hello crazy week. 2 projects due, first print for independent study, and 20 hours on shift between my two jobs to look forward to. :D @Kylogram we open now. @Kylogram We may be setting up Gaming Club closer to 10 tonight, so if you want to hang come to Exhibition Hall. @subwayfreshbuzz Roast Beef footlong is so gonna happen this Saturday. I can't wait for #ANYtober! RT @subwayfreshbuzz: Just 2 more days until the start of #ANYtober, when all regular FOOTLONG subs are just $5! What will be your first  ... @GollyAbsolutely Finger dancing included. We miss you Amanda! @Kylogram Oh and on that note I won't be at Gaming Club until 9 but we're opening at 8 as usual minus DDR until after 9. @Kylogram That just might kill me. I won't be home til midnight and I have a mega busy evening tomorrow night between Gaming Club and PRIDE @Kylogram Okee dokee, if we do shoot early tomorrow we're gonna have to make parts of it quick just because light sucks after noon. @Kylogram No can do, I've got a morning class. MAYBE we can shoot right after I get out at like 11:15ish. @Kylogram I have to do that photo shoot before the end of this weekend. Pick a morning when you're free. Where is everyone today? Usually this classroom is full by start time. RT @JhonenV: Just got $32 from BMI for writing the lyrics to 'Bow Down' in ZIM.  Fuck Subway, it's a QUIZNOs kinda night.  See ya later, ... Dude who hates nicer paper and likes crappy paper: next time please don't lurk on the 5th floor while I'm printing. @Kylogram this morning if possible, the sooner the better between now and noon Apparently when I'm critical I have an attitude problem and I need to calm down. Maybe you wouldn't care if my name was Joe Thiel playing keyboard with my stomach #tipsy My head feels funny. @SailorHarlot THIS GUY MY BABY DADDY Yes we all have work to do. Congratufuckinglations. But it's not like anyone's keeping you from doing that besides yourself. I don't know why everyone is in such a sourpuss mood today. It's totally pissing me off. @Kylogram Can we do the interview this weekend? @LincolnHall I think what I miss the most about Chicago while I'm away at school is all of your awesome shows. @Kylogram JESUS BACKWARDS SOUNDS LIKE SAUSAGE. Holy shit Habibi is much more dense than Blankets. Great read so far though, and a really beautiful book. @Kylogram haha, we can at least overview what we're gonna talk about. I think I can record the interview another day, also need photos. @Kylogram a project for one of my classes. I think you're an interesting person of interest who is interesting. Darkroom open for the first time this semester, and all but one of the regulars have shown up. @Kylogram Could I possibly interview you sometime very soon? Even at work I will still crank the volume when Loud Pipes comes up. Listening to Ratatat does funny things to my ears. I really really hate hospitals, and all the waiting that goes along with being in one. @CanonMistress I think I have Adam hooked on this show now :D http://t.co/3Rm1zr5e @SweetLeafTea Citrus Green with @SailorHarlot ! @SailorHarlot @canonmistress it was "The Window" @Kylogram Technically it is dinner theater. :P @Kylogram At our e-board meeting at Drag Queen Bingo. :P @Kylogram Correct Sir. But we will be in Goldstein 5 and 6 as usual. Bring any Xbox game you want to play! Cooking with Sriracha: always a good idea. :D Cooked down my ground pork in sriracha, made one meal out of it and probably have another two. @SailorHarlot You would :P Holy shit Publix. That was the best sub ever. Jerk Turkey and Chipotle Gouda with surprise bacon. NEVER TAKE IT AWAY FROM MEEEEE. @JesseShadfly I hope all the food comes with the prefix of "River". COME GET RIVERBURGERS AND RIVERWICHES. @Kylogram Maybe if we keep it short we can pull it off in between dinner plans and night crit. I'll let you know when I get home from dinner @Kylogram Hey Woodchuck Wednesday is gonna have to be late tonight if at all. Dinner plans arose and then I have a night crit. Self Portraits! I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://t.co/Q9Pw8XN Photo: girlprince: Ahem. http://t.co/XRFJCQs @Kylogram And they'll fight on the playground over some girl while singing "Tighten Up". WHERE DA PRINTS AT, GICS? Seriously gaiz. I'm waiting to see anything come through. Good day is good! Farmers market in the morning, finished up an assignment, fundraiser at a bowling allley, had a white Russian and won! @DrinkAriZona Cheers Arnold! And Cheers to you too, AriZona Tea! http://t.co/9TmbzFF @Kylogram Nope, different room of the apartment. That was an unwelcome surprise upon returning home.

Also as my iTunes pulls up "The Shrew" I am more and more happy that Beirut actually played it at Lollapalooza. It might be my favorite. :D I think this year's end of the year lists for music are going to be really tough to pick. So many good new albums this year. @Kylogram anytime after 7 pretty much. @Kylogram Bring dat shit over here! I have my own but let's celebrate @WoodchuckCider Wednesday together! Pumpkin woodchuck is coming to Sarasota. :DDDDDDDDDDD @WoodchuckCider THIS JUST MADE MY DAY! :D 2/3 of the way done with the first of my three full size sketches for Independent Study. @NikoruV21 http://t.co/ZVsRoKD Today's Agenda: Moe's Monday with photo buddy, work on indepednent study, play more LBP2, work, then maybe shoot more self portraits. Having trouble calibrating DDR and getting used to commons. Hope this first night doesn't completely trainwreck :/ Also very happy to see that our local pub got @WoodchuckCider on tap! :D PDI Pub night was a lot of fun. I could definitely get used to it as long as I keep it to one drink instead of two from now on. Not sure how early is too early to watch surrealist animation. Lol I've been here for an hour and a half, and not a single print order has gone through.

Setting up the gaming club table for club fair. Feelin' like I just wasted my night. Awesome. @Kylogram 7 - 9 PM @Kylogram And now they've re-rescheduled the club fair back to being Friday. So yes, we will be there. @JesseShadfly FUCKYEAH DIRECT DEPOSIT Just popped open my first @WoodchuckCider Fall Cider, gonna watch In Cold Blood now. Comfort Eagle is a surprisingly fitting song to listen to while reading a book about Media Studies. Also whole album is just lovely. @Kylogram that got pushed back due to the weather. Now it's mid September. Falafel Breakfast Sandwich at Big E's. Weird? Yes. Delicious? Also yes. @Kylogram seriously I will make sure we hang out this week. @Kylogram Sorry I was not around today! I was actually just at Big E's. If you got a few minutes I'm not going anywhere til 7. @Kylogram maybe come by tomorrow after 3:30? I should be out of class by then and not doing anything. @Kylogram We gotta head out for a bit. But text me when you're free and I'll let you know where we are. @Kylogram When is a good time for you? I'll be around for the majority of the evening I believe. @GollyAbsolutely It's been too long since we've done the finger dance. @GollyAbsolutely Do you mind if we continue to use Burger Dog for Gaming club advertising and such for the time being? Also COME VISIT US! @Kylogram Yessir, but only I am home. Nicole and Adam are both in class. @Kylogram Same apartment at last year. DMing you my phone number and my Apartment # 10 minutes til I can get my keys from Res Life and not be stranded in the apartment. Been awake for too long already, and parents are driving me crazy with moving in before I even have keys. Awesome. @Kylogram I'm bringing you something special. Come find me next week when I'm back in town. Leaving for Florida in 12 hours, perfect time to start packing. :D I am so happy I waited to get my copy of Big Lebowski, because this Limited Edition Blu-ray release is fantastic. Okay seriously I think my mom must have tried on every pair of glasses in the store to take this long. For now I just have to wait on my mom to finish her eye appointment. Maybe I should wake up this early more often. Already got a lot of shit done and got breakfast at Einsteins! @Kylogram 90% of tumblr is funny pop culture reference gifs, 9% is commentary on news, 1% is about tumblr users. Go from there. Ohai cough please go away nao kthxbai.Seriously where did you come from? #Iblamethedentist @michellekroskey I had an issue with them a few months ago. They failed to deliver three days in a row because they came after 8PM. And now I wait to see if my bottle opener shows up before I leave.

Would love to stick it out the last few hours but I can't manage today. See ya next year lolla! Aaaand now it's pouring. Glad I made it to a cooling bus in time to get a seat. The soaking wet crowd took over the aisle. Panera break yaaaay. Free wifi, air conditioning, cold water, and a tasty bagel to beat the heat for now. Well shit. Turns out today is a scorcher. Cooling bus breaks and water refills will be on the uprise. Might take a panera break too. Also, got away from that nasty sick chick on the purple line playing her awful music through her speakerphone and coughing up a storm. Looks like a rainy day 3, but still should be a very good last day. Only at @lollapalooza can I see Death From Above 1979 and Beirut in the same day. Magnificent. Day 2 was amazing. No way...Lykke Li is covering Silent Shout. #lolls Gonna chill over at the Google+ stage until Beirut. :D #lolla Ummwut never have i seen a drunk person who wanted to sanitize the railings and bars inside a CTA bus until now. #lolla Headache coming on but holy shit Muse. Sitting on the sidelines for the encore #lolla Uploadin' the pages to my book :D It's almost all done! Then I can peacefully enjoy my @lollapalooza guilt free all weekend. :D Last photo shoot of the summer complete! Photo editing + book finishing + white russians starts now. Finally able to watch the Big Lebowski and enjoy a white russian at the same time. @SailorHarlot Because I know that iTunes moved a bunch of my files into a folder called compilations. Might wanna check there. @SailorHarlot Is it missing from the library on the iTunes app or on your hard drive itself? Obama's birthday is the top news story tonight because he's having a fundraiser in Chicago tonight. #dontcare @WoodchuckCider I'm excited to hear this announcement! Gonna enjoy a Woodchuck Crisp later today for #WoodchuckWednesday Now I wait to see if there's gonna be a fat check for me to cash. #lolprollynot #ihavenomoney #volunteerworkwutwasithinking And one already replied back!

I seriously thought the two classes were the same time. Finally found my @WoodchuckCider variety pack, and the cider maker's choice was Crisp. I'm intrigued to see how this new one is :D Can @LincolnHall magically be transported to Florida so I can go to that Neon Indian/Com Truise show? God damnit every band I want to see is playing in Chicago when I'm in Florida. and to top it off they're all playing @LincolnHall. Gonna go get mah teefs cleaned. Watching old Degrassi from before they started killing people off and ruining their lives. Woodchuck 802 and smoked baby Swiss on ritz = perfect midnight snack :D I have a feeling the new Bargain Bin album I'm working on will be full of church choirs and melodic percussion. Going to go photograph an A Capella concert today. WRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY #work Dear @subaru_usa, thank you for making cars that get me home safely when the streets flood up to my headlights. :D Loop Station progress from today: Two Electric Jerry Curl songs, two on the fly songs, one guitar + overdrive + flange + loop station. :D Got my loop station today, already managed to do an Electric Jerry Curl song live.

PIcking up ones that interest me and the ones he definitely requires (like Maus) Read over the reading list for Lit of Comics, realized I have a very slim margin of what is on there. Comix Gallery trip will happen soon. Bad news: The USB port on my Akai LPK25 just broke. Good news: Gives me an excuse to upgrade to the Akai MPK soon. Not to throw Incubus under the Incu-Bus (GET IT) but srsly gaiz. I like your music just fine but there are better places to advertise. LOL I think it's hilarious that Incubus advertises their side scroller game on Pitchfork but they've never been reviewed. Got something of a head start on my independent study for next semester. :D @SailorHarlot Oh shit, no car this year? Ordered my BOSS Loop Station. Gonna be able to work on my live setup real soon :D Couldn't find the variety pack, but ended up leaving with a 6-pack of the 802. Hooray for @woodchuckcider ! Working out my @lollapalooza schedule again, and just noticed there's a Google+ stage this year. :P @NikoruV21 Yaaaaaay! I think I might have coach all to myself, pretty sure most of these people in suits are flying in business class Fun times at Dave and Busters followed by Mango cooler at the bar for happy hour. Fun last evening acheived! Enjoying a quiet evening watching "Back to School" with Nicole and her mom. :D Playing "Predatory Wasps of the Palisades" in the Palisades Mall parking lot. #sufjan Had to ask the guy at the liquor store which beer to buy because I really had no idea what the fuck I was doing. #justturned21 This concert is fucking ridiculous. Visuals matching up with the music in perfect harmony, but too many stoners for my taste in the crowd. I'm at Central Park - Rumsey Playfield (Central Park, 69th St & 5th Ave, New York) w/ 4 others http://4sq.com/o9WAHY I guess that in Pennsylvania your penis falls off when your hair grows past your shoulders.

On the bright side the free in flight television is working. Watching food network until we take off. 25th in line to depart? You have got to be fucking kidding me. I think this makes it 2 hours delayed. Hoboi the lights are flickering. Delayed an hour because of the storm Thunderstorms delaying flights out at the airport.

There are more old people than photo majors here today. Lol our Internet is strangely fucked. I can access only twitter...? "The Crystal Cat" should always be listened to at full volume.

So many people coming in with submissions, this is gonna be a great crit tomorrow and a great photo show! Accidental nap, added one more thing to my plate for the evening. At least this will be pretty chill. Woohoo nervous breakdown because of stupid shit. Can't wait for the rest of my nervous breakdown to come through. This is ridiculous. Here's to hoping I can finish what I need to in the next hour...ish, and that when I get back Nicole and Adam will be home. So tired and hungry, still have cleanup and hw to do and a busy weekend ahead of me. Baaaaaaaaah. "Do you want 200 Bonnaroo posters?"

The package through UPS got to me just fine. Lasership? NOT SO MUCH. Hey Amazon, could you NOT send my package with a shipping company I've never heard of that tries to deliver things at 9:20pm?

Good times with Schwartzie, glad he was available for a few hours. :) I am so sorry to @Magaworks and @JesseShadfly . I wish I could see you both this coming week, but it's just not in the cards.

I accept that my flight is fucked, REFUND ME IN FULL FOR THIS. @JetBlue Thanks for dropping my call! I'll stay on the line, but if you wanna get back on twitter and help me that'd be lovely. Oh, and also @JetBlue, I think my girlfriend would like an apology for you pretty much canceling my visit unless you can get me on a flight. Hey @JetBlue, would you mind not canceling JUST my flight twice in a row? That would be great. Don't tell me to call, I'm already on hold. Let me see if I have this right. First you cancel my original flight, then you won't let me check in or print my boarding pass at home. WTF. "how do you miss it with poop? You sit down to poop!" we've spent far too long discussing poop. It's bad. Really bad. @SimpleBeauty Oh Courtney, you'll definitely get swooped up by someone wonderful, I only know a handful of people as awesome as you :) LOL, sorry, can't complete my timesheet for zero hours when I'm not on campus :P Thanks for telling me what snacks I can get on my flight you just cancelled! I really appreciate it. God damnit. Flight cancelled, need to stay on Jetblue's phone line until they answer my call and can help me with this crap. &#9829; Laughing Hieroglyphic by Avey Tare #lastfm: http://bit.ly/d0DFCB amazon: http://amzn.to/cy50Mo Audio: Hello Steamboat Fans! As a special Steamboat Surprise, I’d like to share with you the Boatmas Carol!... http://tumblr.com/xre14ltaec Slowly adjusting to Chicago again. Snowing today, so car slid all over the place. Still might head out for Chinese though. @Magaworks Meep. Holy crap. I think I have a row to myself :D That being said, the lady next to me was very nice, and name dropped some Ringling teachers she paints with at her painting classes. Lolz. Made it to Atlanta after feeling crappy on the first flight. Hope this next one goes better. In flight Internet is still strange to me Flying home today. Gonna miss Florida, but less than a week til I see Nicole and less than two til my return to Sarasota! :) Gonna go shower and see how well I make it through my busy day. Had really strange dreams where my reality mixed with Arrested Development and Plants vs. Zombies. Great. Could barely sleep, felt like I was tossing and turning all night until my alarm went off. &#9829; Girl Inform Me by The Shins #lastfm: http://bit.ly/iXdd amazon: http://bit.ly/DORbC I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/hKgN73 Maybe mailroom will refund me for the extra I paid for next day shipping that was thwarted by their fail. And to think I arranged my shipments so that they would arrive on days when mailroom was open to avoid this kind of problem. WTF. Hope I can still pick up my friends' Christmas presents when I get back, but now I'll have to be more stealthy with it. This is such shit. The mailroom fucked up big time over break. I just realized I may have left my Crystal Castles shirt at home this semester. Or so I hope because if not I don't know where it is D: @Magaworks WE'RE GOING TO THE MOOOON! Don't forget your moon pass! @wastedwings That might keep me busy til I leave for Chicago :P @wastedwings I KNO RITE? I started that a few days ago. Took over my life until I finished adventure mode. :P Actually made time to get off campus and shoot. It's awful how much one stupid comment has affected me. A few minutes ago it was Creed instead of Led Zeppelin. #wutisthiscrap Enjoying my start of the day curry ramen. Today's soundtrack is my roommate listening to Led Zeppelin and playing Warcraft III. This is odd. @Kylogram it's been that long since you've been? Granted, I started going at the end of my freshman year. But I've had no problems yet. @SailorHarlot You and me both, sugar pie. Woke up at 3:30 today. @SarcasticJoy @wastedwings Generally speaking I've had the least problems with Golden star compared to other SRQ Chinese places. @Kylogram I think Golden star is still better than Uncle Wen's. A good value, but lacking in convenience and quality. 2nd wind-ish from curry and chinese donuts. Uncle Wen's is very good, but still not my favorite. Waiting on chinese food, continuing to watch Arrested Development, this time staying a bit more awake. :) @Kylogram: I'm trying Uncle Wen's tonight, I hope you're right about how good they are (and hope they can find me). Nicole is off to NY, marathoning Arrested Development today. STEVE HOLT! OK, Drunken Poet. You win. That was spicy just the way I asked for it. Maybe a bit over that even. But I respect that. :) Using art supplies to fix a rock band drum pedal. @moosebmd the back of the pedal doesn't pop up at all anymore. :D It's just like new now! Rrrrrr the bayou hates my Misfits mug. Another one just broke today. I might have been better off just letting it fall and hit the carpet. "Obviously you're not a golfer". Slowly waking up again and watching one of my favorite movies again. :) Today is definitely a lemon lift day. :) Sugar pie is on his way back to PA :C Won't see him for a month. trying* Why yes, PS3! This is exactly the right time to make me do a system update, right when I'm tring to watch Netflix with Adam before he leaves Exit sore throat, enter stuffed up nose. This is why I don't like chilly Sarasota. :P I am very out of practice/probably shouldn't have had pizza right before playing DDR. /dead I'm losing sugar pie a day early :'C worst news ever I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/fJKi3A Shit, I must be in a really ecstatic mood right now. I just made a gigantic blog post, and emailed two teachers from my high school. Finished my course evaluation for Joseph's class #2, took a while to find the right words to say. Digital Storytelling was fucking awesome. I just updated "Raffle" on my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/cxIuFh I feel more stressed now that I'm done with everything. This isn't right. At all. Dear Ringling, please stop blocking SoundCloud. I want to listen to the new Basement Jaxx and my friend's personal work. HARUMPH. At Sound.Motion II, taking it all in. So happy to be a part of this :) Waking up to phone calls and Sufjan. Really loving "Jacksonville" more recently (the song, not the city in Florida by the same name) Taking the extra ten minutes between finishing printing and working to check up on sleepy Nicole was well worth the extra cold walk. :) BAAAAH. My Tupperware is meant for food, not for paintbrushes. Hate having to trash perfectly good Tupperware. Looked up the photographer for the book, only book that he's released so far, but he has another couple planned that look awesome! Found a fucking awesome photo book at Goodwill for $3, sending my dad a nicer copy of it for Christmas. I think he'll love it too. :D In other more important news, wrote up a resumé tonight! Hope that will help with getting an internship for the summer. Oh well, I can't tell you how to spend your time. Just don't be surprised if I go over your head again. I'm not saying that it should be an immediate concern, but from the whiney texts you sent me, I figured you'd be more interested in that. LOL what fail. I emailed you all the info you wanted from the meeting, and you're answering questions on a dating site instead of reading it @imabima The idea of an oxygen bar is questionable to begin with, and at a bar/bat mitzvah? I don't think it's a good idea. Productive night is productive Pwning the roommate on facebook, enjoying some Fujiya and Miyagi Sufjan, tea, and a scone while I wait :) I'm all sniffly today. Going to write an essay and print some shit both in a press and digitally today. Woohoo I'ma die! :D My roommate's apathetic and quiet nature is not really clicking with me, and it's only emphasized when he's the only other one here :/ I shouldn't get a lower grade because you didn't understand my piece. I'll send you a statement so you can figure it out, but this is fail. Lab time! Gonna be burning DVDs and (maybe) printing. Will probably be sticking around til late. @JesseShadfly FRAAAAACK http://pitchfork.com/news/40910-jeff-mangum-performs-surprise-show-in-brooklyn/ Volcano Burrito made this drive back slightly better. Spicy food improves my mood greatly :D @Gebji that's great Hero! :D Lolfail. Random girl didn't return to the bus. Stuck in Miami til further notice. @Kylogram actually we are planning on having club one last time next week. It will be a quieter gaming club but club nonetheless Lol I can't use vending machines because my wallet is just full of publix receipts. :P @Kylogram Whoa shit. Sorry about that, if you throw me your personal email I can add you to Gaming Club's email list. Someone in CJ is using eraser tool to cut something out of a photo in photoshop. kinda wanna smack the mouse right out of their hand. One video ready for DVD, Sunday is going to be hell day :P YUSS. my video installation test is working beautifully Rendering video 2 of 3 for my installation next week. This has been the busiest and best semester of my life. @wastedwings I'll probably post them to my Behance when I'm all done with them @wastedwings I'm doing these for Joseph's class, and my base files are ranging from 1.2 - 1.5 GB before I crop them 17 image pano. :P Just finished videotaping the fashion show, going to take a quick cold shower before work. Exhibition hall was way too hot and cramped. A little bit hungry, been fairly lazy as far as work is concerned. Eep. Feeling crappy, gonna pick up my prints (hopefully) and head home Made a curry with our thanksgiving leftovers. Fucking delicious. :D Just waking up, need to shoot video today as soon as everyone else does. I suppose late night is late. :P Watching Rock of Love on Netflix, Rodeo is fuckin bitches up in her pajamas. BAD ASS. Awake and waiting for everyone else to wake up as well. Getting a later start to Black Friday. I need to be better about understanding sug's boundaries. I feel awful now. :C @Gebji ugh I am not excited to fly through Atlanta this winter. Kinda wish I had a 3rd class today right now so that I could do something other than wait for my keytar to show up :P Fresh air for a second. Stuck on bottom floor still tip further notice My feet fell asleep while I had them propped up on the desk, waiting for the rest of my body to crash. LOL good thing I bought Snoop's Upside Your Head before it got pulled from the catalog. :P @Kylogram Hero and Clint are trying to find you, where you at? I will always care about the people around me and I know they care about me. But I wish it showed more sometimes :/ I'm trying to find myself too, it's not like everything is sunshine and roses for me all the fucking time. I think that being a good person is getting old. Maybe I should just be a stubborn asshole and I'll feel better. Oh, and I also should stop doing nice things for myself and stop being good at things so that I don't make anyone else feel bad. I should also stop making plans so that they can't be questioned or interrogated or shat upon. I should just stop trusting people. Or associating with them. Then I won't ever feel let down or used anymore. Just finished watching the Hudsucker Proxy, I think I really like the Coen Brothers. :D @Kylogram That's good at least. Still, FL drivers are assholes. @Kylogram Hope you're alright dude! Just watched the video for the Suburbs...holy fuck. Gonna go to class now. @JesseShadfly Fuckin' nostalgic. I remember when I first got my POS Acoustic, that was the first song I learned on it. :P Made my first email regarding internships. Still shaking a bit :/ @Kylogram The Bayou! One Moar!I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/cxIuFh I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/d6qCcz @Kylogram: 1013 is the number to know for Thanksgiving :D DLing the new Girl Talk finally, It's been a while since I've listened to him...at all. I hope you don't fuck it up this much next year when there's 60 of us trying to register for the 30 slots you gave us. Fuck scheduling. Seriously, you guys need to do a new headcount for people in this major. It is NOT the same anymore. @JesseShadfly Yup Yup! 98, top of the class :D Woke up a little late, barely got to class on time. Teacher accidentally read out my grade instead of my name. :P lolwhoops I am terrible at remembering to post to my normal blog instead of Midi Steamboat's Blog. :P Make that funky monks. The file format I had for mission hill was not supported No Internet, minimal cell service. Texting twitter from my iPhone. This is pathetic. Curry ramen and mission hill til further notice. BAAAH. copier doesn't do reverse copies, the copier that does won't be in for a week. Waiting on a scanner so I can flip it. @GuitarHero: Question 3.3) Which instrument does Scott play in Sex Bob-Omb? A Rickenbacker Bass @GuitarHero: Question 3.2) How many songs are available in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock? 93 on disc. @GuitarHero: Question 3.1) “Pilgrim” director Edgar Wright is perhaps best known for his work on which British zombie? Shaun of the Dead @SailorHarlot You're telling me. :P I too have found some scheduling conflicts for next semester. :( Two new projects today, please check out all three!  I just published a new project to my @behance portfolio: http://bit.ly/cac08m Dear god this has been a long morning. Morning recap: Adam is a lifesaver, listened to an old man's story for two hours, and now waiting for pizza to cook so I can eat. VISIT MOONVILLE! http://moonvilleblog.blogspot.com Tasty burger = happy David. :) Sitting and waiting on the 2nd floor Finishing reading with a hot cup of tea and mini cinnamon buns :) Also, my phone has changed greatly in the past week. Lock Screen background is now a Monet painting, ringtone is Age of Adz. :D I think I've listened to Sufjan Stevens almost everyday in the past couple weeks. Also, @ classmate, you need to be worrying more about making your work look even semi decent than Kinect and L4D. Your last project blew. Two things in order of importance: I feel awful about last night. I know it wasn't really my fault, but my phone shouldn't have been silent. Communist: ruining all my favorite songs, one awful singing attempt at a time. At least I got him to sing Miley Communist sings rock lobster, I cry deeply on the inside. I am dead inside now. Thanks a lot communist jerk. :( Holy crap. Looked into number stations like Joseph suggested during crit on Tuesday, and found the Conet Project. I am intrigued greatly. :D Thank you for starting to tell me something, then stopping in the middle and being pissed even though I was paying attention. Appreciate it. Black bean burger and spicy three pepper hummus, together again at last :D Mmm. Unsweet iced tea with a little bit of milk. Fuckin' tasty and refreshing! LOL what was that. We needed to get multiple opinions on whether or not my text read on my poster. Still fucking fun as hell though. Friday after class will be my day to really tackle pro-drums. Got my cymbals today, Pro-Drums has more of a learning curve than I had anticipated. I'm really getting obsessed with "Too Much" by Sufjan Stevens. There's something really drawing about the rhythm he uses. I can already tell this side of the lab is going to be annoying tonight :/ I am seriously embarassed for you. You should know how to log and capture by now, and shouldn't be asking me THE DAY BEFORE THE VIDEO IS DUE Whoooo crashed Photoshop while trying to save my file. Good thing I saved not too far back. Guess it doesn't like 6.66GB documents :/ I got mine in the mail today out of nowhere. It's actually proving useful too! No more change on my desk. Apparently my mom has been rocking the Kellogg Cereal box code system and sending off for lots of Ham Piggy Banks from Toy Story 3. Unsweet tea, spicy foods, and Come on Feel the Illinoise. Morning is improving, Printmaking soon for massive prints. :D Waking up on time today, with my breakfast tea an and apple cider muffin. :) No cookies for you means no cookies for you. Harumph. open faced chorizo sandwich on Einstein bagel = Happy David :D Also, I just realized I've been on facebook long enough to see wall-to-wall rollout and end. God damn I'm getting old. I don't know how I feel about this new Friendship page on facebook. Also, R.I.P. Wall-to-Wall. :( @GollyAbsolutely hey Amanda, does you have any scary games you can bring to gaming club tonight? Call or tweet me if you do. I like seeing your smile again. :) Listening to Postal Service before class, probably some correlation to the fact that I can't access the mailroom until after class :P I seriously feel like I've been poisoned. Being outside in fresh air has not been helping. I am fucking pissed. Then he just scrapes off the burnt parts and eats it anyway. My roommate. SO. FUCKING. STUBBORN. I swear his toast is going to kill me I keep telling him to just use the toaster oven since it fits the entire piece instead of his beyond retarded method that burns it everytime It's bad when I have to step out of the apartment because the burning toast scent is too overpowering for me to handle. It may be "Fall" here, but I will listen to "Summer Song" by YACHT still and like it. :D @moosebmd : I couldn't afford the keyboard yet :(. Played through a few songs last night with the standard instruments though. SO HAPPY. :D I'm holding off til Friday most likely to play again. But DAMN this was a fun first night with the game. Not to mention there is now the continue song after failing option. It puts you on No Fail mode, but no more half done songs! OOOHHH MAH GAWD. Had some spare time to play Rock Band 3 tonight. First off, new interface is fucking sweet. Drop in/out works beautifully. Maybe if I'm still remotely awake after work I can pop the disc in. If not I'll probably end up playing on Friday :P picked up Rock Band 3, and have work in 30. Waiting on the bonus DLC pack from the pre-order to DL. Just woke up from a four hour nap...I have class in about 10ish, but I want to stay home and listen to @octopusproject 's new album. :P SHIT. Just realized I forgot to return my video camera. At least I can return it in the A.M. Waiting on the boss to return so I can return to my stuff upstairs. Watching Lost in Translation while working on my presentation for Digital II. Good use of work time :D enjoying my morning more since my class was cancelled so I didn't have to wake up early. LIstening to new Girls single, and it's excellent! Perhaps it would be for my own good if I wait until after classes. I don't think they'll run out of the pre-ordered copies. On the one hand, I'd have it nice and early. On the other hand, I have a morning class the next morning and I'd be tempted to play early. Gamestop texted me saying that they'll be doing midnight release on RB3. The question is, do I want to go? Log and capture accompanied by Wolf Parade. Tonight is a very quiet night in Cooley @moosebmd It's hilariously terrible. I know everyone is just getting out of class but this is REALLY empty. Hope this is worthwhile Playing Robot Unicorn attack while waiting for laundry to finish. Good choice! Sleep in a few. Chilly nights in the apartment are best thwarted with lemon lift. Bigelow hot teas are saving my life. :D Feist always helped me keep my sanity at work over the summer, so it's slightly reminiscent of that whenever I listen to it now. RT @RinglingCollege: Matthew Holler presents "Industry" solo fashion photo exhibit @ the HuB, Saturday, Oct. 23 | 8 pm-midnight $5 cover ... Curry ramen, lemon lift, and the office are making up for the long day. Peanut butter is to follow shortly. @moosebmd Love golden star. :D So netflix on ps3 is no longer disc based, and the stream loads faster, the quality sustains better, and my disc is now a collectible #win @Magaworks Not according to Wikipedia! The official title is just Illinois, the extended is come on feel the illinoise Done with the edition for the most part, may redo one that was a little underinked. Right now I just wanna go home and listen to Sufjan. @Magaworks tweetdeck is better. It's like new twitter but not awful :D I think it was for the best that I took until now to listen to Sufjan Stevens' "Illinois". However, now I want to write a concept album :P St. Pete awesome times so far: picked up a Sufjan album on vinyl and found a copy of Gay parade, now sitting down to Thai food and sushi :D Looking at Color 4x5 film, heavily considering practicing at home and maybe shooting for the photo show. I just noticed that everyone on Hey Arnold! shakes hands with their left hand #leftypride @Kylogram *tweet-five* he needs a bit more talking to like that. @Kylogram We call him communist because last year he always wore a red shirt to gaming club. And he was a Douchebag. @GollyAbsolutely @Kylogram Also sorry for the hold up. Busy Friday night between shows and dinner. We're still eating but we'll be by ASAP @GollyAbsolutely @Kylogram how about we stop by and kick him out first, then we bring the equipment afterward? @GollyAbsolutely at some point yes. What goes on there right now/should we bring rock band stuff? My body is still tremoring from yelling. I don't know why he can't take a fucking hint. just spent the past 15 minutes filming my roommate's mouth while he played Smash. I'm thinking I'll call the resulting video "Game Face" I can't read minds, I'm sorry I didn't know this would make you so angry. But I have been absent of everyone tonight, not just you. RT @coslive: In case you missed it, Beastie Boys MCA is healthy, according to Mike D's wife: http://tinyurl.com/2exzgup Heading off for the labs for a while, then back home to work on printmaking sketch. Tonight never ends :P Thankfully it turned off about a minute after. I'm pretty sure the smoke cleared out of the apartment. But still...this is a problem. Dear Roommate, we have a toaster oven. Those things are good for toasting smaller pieces of bread so you DON'T SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM. Gah. However, decision has been made yo! Used it to offset cost of cymbals for RB3. Aaaand, I will be not spending any money after that. After having my plans thwarted twice, I made my decision on how to use my Amazon card. I will take care of my waterpik elsewhere. :/ Rendering dat video. Hope the changes made + the audio make a difference. @SailorHarlot Just give it like 5 minutes and try again. People will eventually quit and you can use it again. On a side note, NEED WAKE UP SOON. Been half awake for the past hour. Meeting after work, then E's. Cancelled my order from Amazon that was supposed to ship at the beginning of the month. Makes me sad that I won't get my Sweet Leaf. Rewind! @GollyAbsolutely Indeed again! :D @GollyAbsolutely Indeed it is! I believe 10:15 is the official time, at ARC @GollyAbsolutely Well at least it'll be easy to remember :D Please don't fail me amazon, I want my mug tomorrow. Favorite mug shattering on the kitchen floor? Check. Finding a nice big gash in my foot afterward? Check. At the Nook with Sugar Pie for Brunch. :D MAN DATE TODAY! &lt;3 Today is definitely my relaxation day. Drinking tea, listening to Avey Tare and weaving lanyard like the days in summer camp. :D His game face makes me lul uncontrollably. It looks like he has to poop real bad. Locks are no match for communism. Could not get it locked in time. :( @moosebmd Well now I'm more excited! :D @wastedwings http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCpSqqPwPDQ Go to 0:57 :P That's what your tweet made me think of. @TheParadodler Gaming club meeting Monday night at 10ish in ARC? @SailorHarlot : Call Kim? Total upswing for printmaking. Hopefully will do alright going back into the digital world Well, my tea will show up eventually. Although I can't figure out why it would take Amazon this long to find it for me if it's "In Stock". @SimpleBeauty I will always remember that song as the song stuck in Marshall's car on HIMYM FUCKYEAH man-date with sugar pie on Saturday. :D At work with the lab gnome. Baaah just ship my damn package already Amazon! I ordered it over a  week ago with Two-day shipping. I love loving my roommate :) &lt;3 Adam Lolfail totally woke up late and got to class just in time to catch the group project thing at the end. Reading becomes more difficult when snapping along to "Tesselate". I need to listen to Centennial a bit more, even if Champ was better. Done with editing for now, new plan is hot and spicy chex mix, iced tea, Tokyo Police Club, and finishing the book for World of Stories. Shit. I thought that last one double posted but it didn't D: @Gebji: I've tried...like three times already since I woke up. :P They're understandably sluggish today, they were up at 7 yesterday. Everyone's still asleep and I need someone to operate a camera for two minutes D: Long day is long and labs are closed. Time for moar modnation racers @JesseShadfly: I would totally join you on a trip to Alto, I haven't been in a music store in too long. D: Pumpkin break (@ Starbucks) http://4sq.com/baSs0P Starting to listen to Handsome Furs, I'm quite pleased. @JesseShadfly: Why would you be thinking about anything else? All I can think about ever is bacon. Also, on an unrelated note, another day of my roommate eating toast in silence, another day of musical cover-up so I don't have to hear it I think I might enter my Storage series into another juried show specifically aimed at still life. Lol I just realized that they're only airing MS Office 2010 commercials during the Office on hulu :P I am certain the whistle song is an ode to the most underrated wind instrument in the history of music, and not about dick sucking From what I can tell the goal is to get him to leave by not playing with him. The communist has returned. D: Printmaking is going much better today. :) @Magaworks for a second I thought you meant @NukaNuki. :( Please come visit Alex! Putting on DFA 1979 nice and loud so that my roommate eating toast isn't the only thing I hear. Seriously, toast sounds awful isolated. Also, DAMNIT Amazon emails are evil. Directed at a game I've been considering for months, and with a $20 price drop. Fuckers. Morning so far: White Pizza, cold tea, Merriweather Post Pavillion. :D Feeling better now. Work was quiet, taking a break at E's. I think I'll be okay for the rest of the week. Still have about 20 self-portraits to fix up, and slowly but surely falling asleep while sitting up. Eep. I need you to just tell me outright what to do differently. I'm willing to keep listening if you leave out the low blows at my work ethic. I wouldn't show up for class and put forth my full effort if I didn't care. I'm just sorry I let you catch my breakdown. I don't care how nice you act after the fact, you still questioned whether or not I cared about the project. Smiles can't cure that hurt. This apple cider is mighty strong. Printmaking in 30, again lost as to what I will be doing, but I might as well flatten my prints at least. Ok, fine. I don't feel guilty about liking Taking Back Sunday anymore. I fucking love Where You Want to Be. It is still one of my favorites. Yelling at the butter container to stop being so fat and taking up space in the fridge. Love living with Adam #BFFs Finally used my gift card, getting a tasty 24 pack of @SweetLeafTea Original in the can! So excited, haven't had any since Lolla. Shutting myself out from everyone else for a while. It's not my fucking fault that you screwed up. Everlong - Expert Drums - Complete, 88%. I feel good now :D Lol when this stupid update finishes downloading, I can watch bluray IN 3D ON MY PS3 FUCKYEAH. OH WAIT I DON'T WANT A 3D TV SHIT @TheParadodler dammit! Way to get my hopes up on those tiny burgers! Blog update, twitter followers! http://davidvelascophoto.blogspot.com/2010/09/digital-ii-photoshop-exercises.html @TheParadodler ONE EXISTS IN FLORIDA? :O where? I thought that was a Midwestern thing This feels like a curry morning. Also a good morning to try my new English Breakfast tea. :D @SailorHarlot: YEAH SON WAY TO BE A GO-GETTER &lt;3 Audio: STEAMBOAT PROGRESS REPORT: Hello Steamboat fans, new and old! In case you were wondering what’s going... http://tumblr.com/xrejdn0ap Now that I'm all done turning myself into a zombie for the retouching assignment, enjoying some more of my economical iced tea. :D Made an indian curry tonight, SO FUCKIN TASTY. Love korean markets. @xxofMontrealxx: I WISH I could be back in IL to come see you guys again! Please come to Florida, I have got to see the False Priest setup! I think my mini-fridge may have bitten the dust :(. Perhaps I should venture for a new one this weekend. Youth in Revolt wasn't too bad, not the best movie I've seen in a while. Fastest Netflix turnaround I've had in a while :P watching Youth in Revolt now that I'm all done with my photo stuff for tomorrow :D Note to self: turn off the soundbar before unplugging it from the headphone jack in the future. Cripes. That was terrifying. Well, at least the SCAT is as unreliable as always. I can just now see it in the distance. 4:15 my ass Good thing I still know the bus schedule. Running to downtown to mail off something quickly. Then back home for food and work What I've gotten out of the reading for World of Stories: If you fuck the cinnamon peeler, you're gonna smell like cinnamon ALL OVER. Kinky. @TheParadodler: My vote for the shirts still goes to burger dog :D I just ousted @brendonbigley as the mayor of Big E's on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ Flatbread panini (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ @JesseShadfly: THE PORT SHALL NE'ER BE VACANT AGAIN, YARRRR. I'm surprised that my Tokyo Police Club listening has fallen off so much. I seriously listened to Champ daily over the summer. Thinking diptych for my next printmaking assignment, not sure of what. Listening to my sanity mix from work over the summer. :D When life gets you down, hold home and lock button for 10-15 seconds and reset all settings. Also works when iPhone won't turn on. :D Taking a walk. Really don't want to have my own meltdown today @moosebmd:I just looked into that more, turns out a majority of the previous catalogue was already mapped for Pro-drums. :D @Magaworks: SWEETIEE NOOO are you okay? Woke up to the sound of my roommate's mother's voice, and saw my door was left wide open D: Now enjoying black bean burger and tea. Meep. Really not having a good night tonight. Steamboat show fell through, gaming club was obnoxious, new rock band plans are not working. :/ @TheParadodler : LTM Party is the shit. The upstairs costume section is sweet. I feel very lucky to have the time right now to play Rock Band at home for a little bit after class. I know this won't last. :P @SimpleBeauty dude I'm now attached to CS5...it's partially due to classes, partially due to the awesome it radiates Finished my CS5 Download, excited to not have to use the trial anymore after next week :D I love living with Adam more and more everyday. &lt;3 Is it bad that I decided to retouch an image for fun tonight, and I ended up removing my eyes, eyebrows, and mouth? :P @SailorHarlot LOL webshare sorting is the best. First or last every critique. I'm sure it's partially due to having watched the live performances earlier, but I think "Sex Karma" will be my fav. from False Priest :D Someone in this lab is being a drama llama :O I don't usually hear people yelling from afar Went for a walk, got tea and a PSN Card. DLing new RB DLC while I can actually take a break. I feel more relaxed now, should be okay. Eeeee's (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ Almost done with work for the evening. Planning on E's and slightly earlier sleep tonight. All done with my regular work, time to watch my netflix DVD that I've had since I left home :p @BarkingCows: welcome to my last week, for a while I was spending more time in the labs than my apartment. Holy shit I just realized our teacher looks like Lindsay Fünke from Arrested Development It's so quiet in here. o.O All out of honey, need to pick some up after class today. Still, English Teatime tea in the AM will hopefully help me survive class. @wastedwings: So I herd you liek True Blood. @Magaworks I can come meet you at your place if you wanna leave the library. Otherwise I can come pick you up there Awake, enjoying my tea, then start shooting for digital II commons, heading to labs to finish composites, and maybe relax later! :D Late dinner (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ Awesome day at Islands of Adventure and Harry Potter land #FloridaLife In Orlando, entering Harry Potter land shortly. God damn it's hot today. Awake, having a quiet breakfast. @tygirr: Also, you need to come back soon. Seriously. Come visit us. @tygirr: no big deal anymore. But yeah...we have our biffs from time to time. I mean, seriously. I didn't start this stupid fucking argument. He thinks I'm getting pissy, he should stop acting like a 10 year old. I don't know why "don't keep saying stupid shit" is such a hard concept for my roommate to understand. @HardHat1296 MACBOOK DOWN? D: NOOOOOOES! I just became the mayor of Golden Star on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/cqqYAa Okay, I know it's late but I can make an exception to watch an episode or two of Hey Arnold! Exhausted from running 5 collagraphs in a row. Time to go composite for 7 hours! Working after class til 10, maybe I will finish this project tonight I think I'm starting to like this waking up with English Breakfast tea thing. It helps when I wake up early enough to make it :P I'm gonna call tonight's composite 70% done. I need to wear headphones or get a desktop with CS5 at home. Out of class early, back to the labs soon for more compositing! Hoping to finish out #3 tonight. @SailorHarlot: LOL accidentally picked up your first shift? Damnit Adam, you got Phoenix stuck in my head this morning. Waking up with Spam 'n' eggs, toast, and tea with milk and honey :D Okay, now I'm more okay with all this compositing. Two pretty much complete, three to go. Three hours of compositing = backing shit up onto two other hard drives right fucking now :D You know it's going to be a long day when his last words in morning class are "I'll see some of you in an hour, and some of you in four" Well, I managed to half-nap in between Mougel classes today. Hopefully I can make it through three more hours today. Good crit was good, seeing where the afternoon takes me until part two of Mougelday. (BTW, Tuesday is now officially deemed Mougelday). "When are you guys going to take out your trash?" A. IT'S RECYCLING. B. YOU'RE THE LAZY MOTHERFUCKER WHO WON'T TAKE OUR THE REGULAR TRASH. Now I have a folder (and filter for the future) called Mougel Mail, or JMail. That man sends a shit ton of emails. I really hope E's is open tonight, I will be pissed if they aren't available to save my life after work tonight. Thank you StumbleUpon. You make this journal thing a lot easier. It's good to have people skills when your job entails helping people. Toaster Nachos are much better on a flat square plane. Labor day work shift in 15. Labor Day is the national day of laboring, right? Seeing Adam browse "Kids Give Me Hope" is adorable. He's going to be a great father one day. Good morning world! Today's brunch menu will be pork, eggs, and Bigelow English Teatime tea with milk and honey. TASTY SHIT SON. LOL finally using my reward points after waiting like...four fucking years XP Baaaaaah. I'm still a bit rattled from my trip upstairs. People need to not make a big deal out of nothing, it just stresses me out more. @Kylogram: For the amount of effort you put forth you definitely deserve more tips. At least you can always count on me and Nicole Lemon Lift makes everything better. :) Grocery run (@ Super Target) http://4sq.com/825S59 And the batteries died. Faaaiiiilll. Lol I was silly to think anyone would be awake before 1 Gah. Stupid HR. not that it's my concern, but if they let me use a xerox they should let sugar pie too. This is such shit. Finally have a time machine for the MacBook as a partition of my new 1.5 TB external. I felt it was only right to name it Delorean. @Magaworks: YES. THEY HAVE THE SHIZNIT. AND DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT. YOU CAN'T STOP MEEEEEEEE I might have to get the whole Snoop Dogg Rock Band DLC pack when it drops for PS3. :P Friday is curry day. (@ Golden Star) http://4sq.com/cqqYAa @JesseShadfly: That used to be worse. On the commercials they had a green screen problem, so some of her polka dots showed the background :P I think if he just works on being less arrogant and stand-offish he'll find someone. Didn't expect him to be on dating sites though. :/ Well now I feel kinda bad. I hope he doesn't feel too lonely. I know how much that feeling sucks. Defensive? Try growing a pair and not just "rolling with the punches". That's why you're single and a failure. Don't ask me for camera purchasing advice if you're going to be narrow-minded and disregard everything I say. First set of prints curated, one print removed from series because the watermark was intrusive. I am most pleased! @SweetLeafTea: Thank you for making some of the best ice tea out there! Been a convert ever since Lollapalooza 2007. :D Dear Macbook, please stop believing that you are open while the lid is closed. This drives me completely insane. New iPod touch looks sweet. It's like having an iPhone without phone service! Upgrade when I'm not poor, maybe retire 5th gen classic? I should really be better with backups. :/ adding to my current backup system while I wait for my new 1.5 TB to show up Sooo. Much. Compositing. BAAAAAAAAAAH. And to think this is just the exercise before we start the final project with five of these. O.O First late shift, working til 2 Also, if you are going to leech, at least be smart enough not to have your computer visible on shared networks, so we don't know about it. Hey kids, our wireless is for use in our apartment only. Please use your own internet when you're not here instead of leeching ours. Not even halfway into my shift and I am already starting to feel pass-out-y. Shit. Work work work work work. First night on shift for the semester. Brian Murphy and sun chips: a winning combination to keep David going until the end of his work shift tonight Well, now it's confirmed. Working on labor day again :P Done with printmaking early today cuz I finished six prints in about an hour and a half, time for E's for short break. :D Two prints done, waiting on my last four sheets to finish soaking Also, I love my singing roommate. &lt;3 He makes me cheery everyday. :) I can't speak real words anymore. I shouldn't already be exhausted. Oh wait, I also have work tonight. :P @BarkingCows: Well of course not! Freshman year I had sunburns on the tops of my feet. That was really unpleasant. Picking up dinner, ready to finish up any last minute hw afterward. (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ CRAP. I think my tea-maker finally bit the dust. Might bite the bullet and buy a new one, it did last two years, and it's only $30. Good morning world! Waking up to Tokyo Police Club and curry ramen. :D "I don't speak French, I don't wanna be friends" --Kim singing "Bad Romance" on RB2 tonight. Night has greatly improved. :D Hello Saturday night!  http://twitpic.com/2j7paw You know how at Thanksgiving there's a kid's table and an adult's table? That's my apartment right now. :P Freshmen invaded my living room. "some people call me Sishir, but I prefer to be called sugar mama" LOLOLOLOL Some days I really don't like people. This is one of those days, and one of those reasons why I don't want to be a portrait photographer. Giving "Extended Ringtones" a full re-listen, but un-scrobbled so I don't look too narcissistic. Working on Digital II Commons later. Gettin' back into DDR tonight, will be emailing for gaming club's first meeting this week. :) For some reason the best Smuckers flavors only exist in Florida. I still have yet to see Smuckers Mango jam or Guava jelly elsewhere :P @wastedwings agreed. Up until a couple months ago that included me. :P although I is teh poor. I just became the mayor of Big E's on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ Black bean burger tonight. (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ "Letting someone touch your RAW files is like letting someone touch your underwear" &lt;3 Mougel As finished as I'm going to be with editing. Gonna read up tonight, hopefully get a lot of new insight out of digital II Yay for Day 2 of classes being 10x as busy as Day 1. Two three hour lectures, and three huge assignments. Isn't it funny that the day I get Beatles Rock Band and my 2nd RB guitar is the same day I get a huge pile of work?  :P Should be prepared for printmaking on Thursday, just need to prepare for Digital Imaging shoot tomorrow and Digital Storytelling Friday. Eep Working on my design for embossing, going with an accordion player. I feel that will be a fun challenge for the first assignment. :D Is it sad that I went for a walk so I could get Internet on my phone? No working Ethernet or cell reception in the apartment tonight. D: Little Big Planet survival levels followed up by a game of Hot Shots Golf. FUCK. YES. Well, I'm awake. That's a start. Class in about half an hour. Seriously, Florida has far too many country music radio stations :P iChat hates our router :( Switching to Adium for the moment. Singing Rebel Girl on rock band at 4AM with the new roommates on the backing band: best first night in the apartment :D Pad Thai time (@ Drunken Poet Cafe) http://4sq.com/dkNMMq Back to big e's (@ Big E's) http://4sq.com/cJU8eQ Why the fuck am I still awake. Borrowing Frosted Flakes from sugar pie, still waiting on parents to show up at the apartment. Feeling tired...and hungry...and kinda gross and sweaty from being outside for 10 minutes and not having a chance to shower yet. BAAAH. Apparently I am awake too early for the rest of the world today. Will grab food after the parents show up, but I can has keys! 3ish hours away from Ringling. Not stopping til we're in Sarasota Last waffle house stop for the drive. (@ Waffle House) http://4sq.com/caxZy2 Apparently when you're a farmworker, the farmer's daughter will be hot, sleep with you in your truck, and bring you sweet tea. Fuck yeah. Country singers are total manwhores. Listening to a song about how he hates his job UNTIL HE MEETS THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER! Waffle House biscuits and sweet tea. Gotta love the south. In Georgia, working our way down to Florida slowly but surely. @Kylogram we're about 12 hours north. See you soon, I'll be requiring my wildberry fruit tea. ;) Murfreesboro, TN for the evening. Maybe maybe maybe Ringling tomorrow, and if so, very late. Just reaching Tennessee. Possibly reaching Ringling by tomorrow. Entering Kentucky via big ass steel bridge.  Hoping to make it into Tennessee by tonight Only time of the year I get to stop at waffle house (@ Waffle House) http://4sq.com/bFsB9h @Magaworks doesn't that automatically remove him from the Illustration Board of Beards? You know you're getting further south when the rest stop vending machines have pork rinds in them. Passing through Indiana at the moment Well, half an hour later than expected is better than we usually do :p. Finally taking off. In a minute. Or five. Hopefully taking off within the hour. By taking off I mean packing the car and driving away :P @SailorHarlot Strenk with any hair at all still weirds me out :p One last night of DDR and ticket games (@ Nickel City) http://4sq.com/cCSdlA Milk Man is such a strange concept album, but damn some of the songs are good on it. Really digging the breakdown in Desaparacere. LOL waiting for phone calls sucks. Hopefully one last trip to Nickel City tonight, leaving tomorrow morning for the 3 day drive to SRQ. One more time. (@ fRedhots & fries) http://4sq.com/8aJ88d @wastedwings: FUCK YEAH FOURTH MEAL! We're talking 79 89 99 YAH YAH YAH Last curry of the summer :( (@ House Of Chan) http://4sq.com/94Vp89 Rock Band Kit, PS3 + other games, and DVDs are all packed and ready to go. Tomorrow the non-important stuff like clothes and cameras :P Dinner break (@ Potbelly Sandwich Works) http://4sq.com/drgQ3F Double feature day starts now. Yay for $6 movie day! (@ Regal Gardens Theater 1-6) http://4sq.com/av8PL9 My Twifficiency score is 43%. Whats yours? http://twifficiency.com/ Although I did pick the worst time to try and do this. :P Getting picked up soonish for movies with Brennan and Katie. Buying a few more songs for Rock Band before I leave for Ringling again. Hey, I managed to not spend the whole card in 5 minutes like usual! @NukaNuki: I'm more of a fan of Japanese curries, but I picked up just a plain curry and a chicken curry today. Usually I go for hot curries Assi does terrible things to me. They have all the things that Super H doesn't and an Indian grocery section. Currypalooza today Soooo much spicy food. Lunch with my mom in a Korean food court = spice overload Our lunch ordering criteria is that is has to say hot or spicy (@ Assi Plaza) http://4sq.com/aUlCrz Even on my tiny ass TV, blu-ray does make a noticeable difference. Too bad the only movie I have is Napoleon Dynamite :P Lol there's nobody on rock band tonight on PSN. Or ever :p OH FUCK. In order to play online I have to download a 935-pc update. Thankfully some are miniscule. This is still going to take forever. :P LOL just dropped my 18-hole score by 19 points. I guess I got better after playng two rounds back to back. #hotshotsgolf Ok, finally getting the hang of this. Also, only one photo job left to finish before I leave for Ringling. Decided to just buy HGS: Out of Bounds. The advanced stroke system is a pain to learn, but I think it's a smart idea. Quite possibly my last super H run D: (@ Super H Mart) http://4sq.com/6vfBrS One last gamestop stop. (@ Civic Center GameStop) http://4sq.com/bFamCA Last business special of the summer (@ Pita Inn) http://4sq.com/8nSniz @NukaNuki: YAAAAY!!! Also, we need to DDR. Either we need to meet up next time I'm in the midwest, or you need to come back to Ringling. HEY DOWNLOAD MAH MUZAC: http://www.mediafire.com/?d6e810ui0t7765y PLZ LISTEN AND RETWEET ME KTHXBAI @NukaNuki: MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO MAH ALBUM TO CURE YOUR BOREDOM! http://www.mediafire.com/?d6e810ui0t7765y (I'm a total whore today) Mate latte is always good on a Sunday night (@ Argo Tea) http://4sq.com/aGa42Y Glad to know my mother is an inconsiderate sociopath. @shmaba: SHAAAAAUUUNNN!!! Welcome back to Twitter! Had a nice skype call with Schwartzie today. Glad he could get to a computer today. Haven't seen him since May. Well I'm awake now. Sparkles' birthday party took the life out of me. Hopefully college won't change him too much. Gonna miss that kid. @Magaworks Kyle to the rescue?

Last few days in town, enjoying my last few lasts of the summer. @SailorHarlot: THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. You're probably just imagining it. Only for Sparkles will we drive out to Niles and disrupt him mid-Magic game in an attempt to kidnap him. Still no Richard :( (@ Walgreens (#5683)) http://4sq.com/7c112m I just unlocked the "Crunked" badge on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/bVLuiy Killing time until Sparkles is done with Friday night Magic (@ Walmart) http://4sq.com/4mM6eS Mate latte for lefty day :D (@ Argo Tea) http://4sq.com/aGa42Y Double curry day!
