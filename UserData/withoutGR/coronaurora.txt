Essential, essential viewing #amour ..course, it's as total as the learned/deliberate masochism &amp; sadism that Haneke likes to unleash on his unsuspecting characters. Capturing every micro-nuance, the violence that a terminal illness unleashes within the sufferer &amp; the main carer who observes nature's... Before #amour, I admired Haneke and his films.

Admitted with much reluctance. wish granted but diagnostic conundrum at 2am is the last thing I wanted. Demented, liver transplant pt referred for ?neutropenic sepsis. another cannula, another catheter, another culture, drugs reviewed, ppm pt with angina: i have ward malaise, need an a&amp;e patient. Nothing like a successful cannula on disgruntled chap being poked with needles all day without success. Last on call of my first job tonight. Counting down the hours. Might tweet in the action. Did an arrest call in a complete daze today. Psychopathic levels of indifference. Morphing into doctor-demon! #AnnaKarenina: what a joke!

Slick but overcooked biopic abt a control freak crooner who gave sinatra "My Day". Gainsbourg this ain't. They are punctuated by drudgery of rewriting drug charts, endless fluid prescribing, warfarin dosing n a protracted post-take ward round. ..bleep,giving orders at 4am when patient's SBAR mixes with your dreams, and all those times when ur Reg approves of ur plans:nights are fun Quiet long corridors, sweets at nurses desks, monitors beeping, patients sleep-moaning, stench of sheets in on-call room, incessant siren of End of 1st set of nights. Surprised myself by resuscitating n escalating at right moments when shit hit the ceiling. Loving the solitary quiet conquests as a night doc.

Despite the alive ensemble, #killerjoe is popcorn snuff Re-read shelley's frankenstein in run-up to boyle's stage adap. Cumberbatch's realisation of the Creature was goosebump inducing. Some lad. #ARoyalAffair is a compelling, accessible piece of Enlightenment/Dutch royalty history.Unlikely characters sketchd wid care adds credibility Cronenberg's #cosmopolis is #wakinglife of pervading financio-economic worries. Wacko &amp; knowingly opaque, about time for a 70mm catharsis Halfway through #madmen Season 5. Almost don't want to watch anymore to avoid confronting a madmen-shaped void, again. Down with flu. Perfect excuse to dip into Mad Men's latest season and be sad and soothed by its characters dipping into weary contemplation. Saw a fab Gael Bernal film aftr ages:Even the Rain, a bolivian politico-social saga abt exploitation &amp; weight of history,conscience n cinema Survived my 1st week of shadowing unscathed.

Got #1Q84 on Kindle (bargain!!) yday but leafing thru a to-die-for hardcover 2day made me sigh. Book on paper is book in flesh:real,tangible @Meenaul how does one catch up with you? Satrapi's #ChickenWithPlums was a charmer! Celebrating quirks with lovely life-montages & humour foiled by aching unrequited central romance ITUs r a curious place.

At wit's end with ppl who want to "meet up" but then give me their whole month's social calendar ON THE PHONE to set a date. Losers. Cant believe I held my breath for #MidnightInParis.

Earnest, accessible film does Bolkovac's mission justice if little else. Sordid crimes of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia is a story worth telling to remind extent of inhumanity we're capable of #thewhistleblower #thewhistleblower=std exposé procedural. Righteous protagonist standing ground against slurry of corrupt prof body.

Asinine levels of self-promotion: can't believe I put up this long. Back to picturehouse n curzon. @MadhuriDixit1 All the best for this new phase in your life. Expecting a cracker comeback on the BIG screen. That's where you belong. Wong Kar Wai's genius continues to elude me. Ashes of Time redux was dull despite the rich photography. From reality--&gt;memory--&gt;nothingness: the hourly routine of my (absent-minded) consciousness.Oh this unbearable lightness of my being #trippy The boozers at my A&E hv made sure that I don't smell alcohol again without being reminded of their vomit. Why people why? Reading a dishwasher instruction manual is probly more fun than sitting thru #tinkertailor. Most uninspired, pointless spy thrillr in years @BinaDouble07 WHATTTTT!!! Goddamn it. That is saddening. I'd watch it with no expectations but really, that BAD? Unbelievable Now tht a showy 17-screen vue at the consumerist wormhole  #westfield will show mainstream dirge, will the stratty picturehouse play indies? They've done a bloody decent job with #westfield stratford. Living down the road from it suddenly seems the best place to be. Interpreting X-rays reminds me of solving those cruel maths equations as a kid. I cud solve em the moment I had looked up the answer. #1wordreview of New #janeeyre flick: MEH!

After slew of lousy buk adaptations,I watch The Time Traveler's Wife, & faith is restored.Captures the book's romance and tragedy,seamless! The movie is one hot mess.Forget sensitivity to murder n paedophilia, Jackson morphs the whole thing to weird afterlife thriller. Creepy! Overall, the book is a sentimental trainwreck from the word go.Sebold's writing is assured n so tender, but the wallowing is bit too much So the book goes on and on about how the girl feels, and the movie constructs pretty structures around her and rolls its eyes (i.e. camera) Just finished with Lovely Bones the buk n film.Pardon the sexism,but this is what happens when a boy makes sense of what the girl means.

Audiard is THE PROPHET! And yes, he has.Nerve-shreddingly tense epic with a protagonist so compellingly sincere that his journey's the stuff ppl write books on. Okay, Audiard might just have made a masterpiece with A Prophet. Am more than halfway through and I cant remember a prison movie this gud Personal fad today:Writng wid fountain pens.Plan to turn it into a 2010 rsolution to use them fulltym.Puts the charm n class back in writing Vindu's an ass,but Pravesh needs anger mngmnt pronto.His descent into bitter psychopath by day's end was ugly n will cost him dear #bboss3 @konkonas just finished watching dosar.and you were stellar in it.So believable.

Spike Jonze sans Charlie Kaufman makes for a refreshingly imagined but terribly mopey fantasy Where the Wild Things Are. So disappointed. Ok, its the morning aftr n I don't think Avatar really has a life beyond the 1st watch.So an incredible "experience" but disposable film @konkonas Oh man that scene at their nuptial night n the flash-fwd in final pages.Such a soul-sucker that beautiful book is.Its tragedy porn ...hands down the most spectacular homage to hinduism n everythng aryan.its the blockbustr with themes every Indian has an authority on. The imagery,motifs,symbolism,spiritual wisdom,color palet of Avatar so effortlessly segues into the tales and charactrs of hindu epics.. Ok,after having Avatar's 3D images burned into my head for 3 hrs & a chaotic day b4, its bedtime.But not b4 seeing who got booted frm BB3. Avatar is directed with such elan, like a neatly choreographed stage performance.3 acts,awesome central story arc n such visual finesse!! WOW! Avatar turns out to be a rare thing of beauty. Now where does one go from here? Totally sweeping sci-fi folk extravaganza! Just WOW! @SahilRiz Cudnt agree more lol. Seen Timecrimes (Spnsh)? It's everything Primer shud've been wid same physics/sci-fi elemnts in lo-fi style @SahilRiz Now that you survived Primer, try Aronofsky's "cult" clssic Pi. Another impenetrable,woefully executed wank for wannabe physicists buckling up for another day of what's turning to be a super-intense week. Only good thing, my excitement to catch avatar, up in the air (though reitman's films are always grossly overrated) n invictus has trebled! only evidence that jury bothered to watch a good selection: nods to Duplicity n Young Victoria. What's with the meryl streep OD? So basically anything thats half decent released in the awards season is better than the genius doled in the rest of the year? Golden globes can kiss my ass for snubbing Moon, Pippa Lee, Mary n Max and Antichrist.For what? Julie n Julia and Its complicated? Mental! Am glad von trier delivered in the decade i discovered him.Had i seen wat he was upto till 2000 before,wud never hv touched his later works so i persisted till the final scene of dancer in the dark to just see the stupid blind ass of bjork hung dead for good.wat a piece of dreck oh man how false n trite is dancer in the dark?

Eyes are like rings of fire and yawns so powerful, they might just crack my jaw. Balki cud hv invested more care in buildng Vidya-Abhi angle,done away with the grating commentry on 4th estate.2nd hf's sublime n subtle tho Paa wasnt half bad.Auro's written with such irreverance n wit.BigB's all heart,Vidya a vision.Now if only I didnt catch Abhi acting so oftn.

Sheer fervor of monks n undercover reporters jst gets under your skin.Its disorientng to thnk a Govt treat its ppl so.Mr østergaard wel dun! Burma VJ is such a kick-in-the-shins doc.Rights we take fr granted evryday denied to a whole nation. Goosebump-inducing stuff. Okay, found Food Inc supremely informed n eloquent doc on agribiz.

Today's episode of Bigg Boss: Reality TV Gold. Tho Y not nominate the 3 than stage elaborate triple caging farce as pnshment's beyond me. "The trick would be in knowing which barriers could be kicked open for progress, n which were defensive,structural" Steve Hall. Indeed! @BDUTT Conceptually this is ideal. But realistically,in cntry as diverse n aspirational as ours,only English can link n unify.Sad bt true. So there was nothing scandalous in Brand's Scandalous and nothing funny (or unfunny) about Apatow's Funny People. Bad video day...yawn! AH! It was André Rieu's Second Waltz that was stuck in ma head and doing it in for past godknowshowmany months. Elated to hv nailed it! Okay I retract, you sorta are. Just started on a bad note. I'll persist with it. Who wants unending apologia for a standup? Mr Brand you are not funny in Scandalous. What happened? @PritishNandy respect Mrchant-Ivory, but Remains of the Day is 2 glum n glib a flick.Completely misses Ishiguro's sarcasm n the main point @PritishNandy whole Indian genius joining the dots is tasteful, but Mistri's Hindi will make u cringe n laugh.he's embarassing. gr8 film tho 2012 is the MOTHER of all disaster flicks.
