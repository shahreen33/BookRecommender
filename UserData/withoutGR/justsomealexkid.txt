Anne Hathaway risking her reputation and a jail sentence just cause she wanted to make female friends is a real-life thing. I want Awkwafina’s quirks and stealth. Mindy Kaling is the cutest, most quick-thinking, little button ever. Sarah Paulson pulling off all that clever smuggling from her family home is genius. Rihanna as the smartest hacker in NYC who turns up to the Met Gala looking FIERCE in a floor-length red gown and dreads is everything. I want to not care about anything like Cate Blanchett doesn’t. If I look like Sandra Bullock when I’m FIFTY THREE, I’ll have made it. Bonham Carter is still my ultimate original girl crush. I couldn’t get over the amount of gorgeous badassery that was happening.
