I'll survive. It was an accident and it involved my dad so I'm going to weasel ice cream out of him @BitchPuddin54 &gt; as what happened last night. @BitchPuddin54 yup. I have ripped my baby toenail off eons ago and it still hurts sometimes and it wasn't as traumatic of an injury &gt; @BitchPuddin54 now i have to keep it covered with an antibiotic ointment and wait until my toenail falls off. :-/ @BitchPuddin54 and I almost kicked the ER doctor when he touched it haha. I feel bad but I am a wimp. I don't deny it. @BitchPuddin54 I had the nail of my big toe ripped off of the nail bed yesterday. It's hanging on for dear life lol Plus I'm afraid the bandaid is going to hurt when it comes off I have to tend to my toe but I reaaaallly don't want to take the bandaid off and look at it. #wimp RT @BrianRathbone: Failure is just proof that you tried.
