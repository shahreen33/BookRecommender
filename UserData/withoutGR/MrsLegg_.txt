Ryan's car is finally fixed which means I've finally got a set of wheels again! 🙌🏻 @kateltmarler let's hope the baby is flipping here by then! They're not inducing me until the 7th 😫 @kateltmarler that is honestly how I feel at the moment! If anything it's flipping stopped anything that had already started 🙄 just gonna have to accept the fact I'll have to be induced 😭 All of these methods to supposedly 'induce labour' are such old wives tales. Been doing all of them and NOTHING. @lizzgeorgia I've got mine ready for Tuesday!! @lizzgeorgia https://t.co/Se2r68Pa0t @lizzgeorgia we need another deans diner date!! Those pancakes are life! 🙌🏻 @lizzgeorgia he better have charged them petrol! Lazy toads!! @lizzgeorgia uh oh you're not in a fight are you 😬 @lizzgeorgia go out with Ben! I'll babysit 😁 Never have I wanted to rush pain so much in my life. Come one bring on those contractions!!!! 💥 Eating Rennies like nobody's business. This better be a sign that labour is on its way!!! The heartburn is real right now 😫 Literally hungry 24/7! The longe this baby is in here the fatter I'm going to get! 😭 @lizzgeorgia it could happen! 😬 Also can I just say that last tweet was exactly 140 characters and it felt good 😎 Everyone has gone out, leaving me no access to a car. Sod's law must state that this will SURELY be when I go into labour?! #wishfulthinking No idea why people say raspberry leaf tea is disgusting? I think it's delicious! 😋 Can't wait to start this! Loved the first one, so I know this one will not disappoint!!… https://t.co/0J37UN52rU @lizzgeorgia you're so organised! So fed up of the kitchen being re-done now. Wish I wasn't on mat leave coz it's pretty boring being trapped upstairs 🙄 @samanthamaria please do! So fed up of sugar coating how difficult motherhood can be with a newborn, we need realistic information! Getting to that point of boredom where I asked my brother if he wanted help tidying his room. Come on Bean! Get a wriggle one! @emskills27 where was my dinner invite! 😱 And here was me thinking I might not cry when Bean is born. 100% gonna be a wreck 😭 I am literally crying every time a baby is born. #emotional Watching OBEM is making me so emotional! Praying for a safe and easy labour for little Bean 👶🏼❤️ Today is our due date! 40 weeks this little Bean has been growing inside of me! As much as we… https://t.co/rmRlojy4Vc Feel so sick 😢 Even though the movements are so strong now (and sometimes quite painful) there really is something special about this 'bubbling' feeling 👶🏼 Making the most of all these belly movements I'm having over the last few days as you never know when Bean is going to arrive! So over being pregnant now. My back is in AGONY!! 😂 https://t.co/SOupdsyfvd @lizzgeorgia nothing yet I'm afraid :( @lizzgeorgia I remember when this was me :( now I'm lucky if I get any peace from Bean 😅 had a bath earlier, deffo not relaxing!!! Lol Watching #OBEM to see if I can coax Bean out 😅 Still hungry, also bored 👍🏻 Also in the mood to spam my twitter feed #sorrynotsorry Really fancy a Chinese... Let's hope I don't go into labour! 😅 There is literally no working car at home ATM. Ryan's is dead, my brothers is dead. My dads at work and Ryan's got my car at work. #fab I am hungry, I have no food. Trying to psych myself up to walk to Tesco, so far it's not working ☹️ @lizzgeorgia that is just CRUEL!!! I swear this baby is going to be 2 weeks late. No urge whatsoever to 'nest' can't be bothered to even get out of bed 😓 Im hungryyyyyyy Also bored of being trapped in the house as Ryan's car isn't working so he's been using mine 😭 So over maternity leave now... I just wanna have my baby!!! @MarkFerris199O suits! Every little twinge in my body got me like 'this is it! Am I in labour?! The wait is over' and then a bit fat NOTHING Bean, im giving you your eviction notice. If you're not out of the womb by next Tuesday further action will be taken! 🤣 @lizzgeorgia you are a bit cray cray! Dunno how you're coping!! The bump has dropped! 39 weeks today! Can't believe how fast and how slow this pregnancy has… https://t.co/6vGHJUmAOQ The bump has dropped! Come on Bean, time to come out now 👶🏼 So close yet it feels so far away! https://t.co/B959Gu21mQ @lizzgeorgia when did you last have them? Are they not attached to your car keys? To do list📋: eat pineapple chunks, bounce on ball, ...😜 come on baby Bean, get a wriggle on! Operation induce labour: spicy food ✅, warm bath with lavender ✅ nipple stimulation 👀✅ The waiting game https://t.co/xYyi3kHu0g https://t.co/uXqxbueLc0 38+2! Feeling MASSIVE. So stretched and so achey. Come on baby Bean! Mummy and Daddy can't wait… https://t.co/qE3oP7BjTY I have always thought this!!! https://t.co/Sh5qw2RhZi Why does my mum always choose the moment me and ryan are going out the front door to have a long winded conversation? 🙄 @lizzgeorgia haha knew I could count on you! 😍 @lizzgeorgia 😘😘😘 9 months without a mcflurry and McDonald's is going to be bloody shut once I give birth!!! Is this some sort of sick joke?! 😡 @lizzgeorgia I swear they do it for a laugh! I've been beaten up for the best part of an hour 👍🏻 Sick of this stupid car demister not working 😤😤😤 So glad they have FINALLY added Law Abiding Citizen to Netflix! Can this baby just be born already please? Stabbing pains in my foof every time I walk!!! Stop pushing on my pelvis 😫 When you 'pop' into work and don't end up leaving till 3 hours later 😂 whoopsie 😬 Also the baby is crushing my ribs so it's a bit tricky to get comfy and relax 😐 Why am I still awake when I don't feel well? Because I had about 8483937473 cat naps today and I've not exerted enough energy to need sleep🙃 2 slices of toast and I now feel like I've put my body over the edge and I'm about to explode 💥 #pregnancyproblems Oh and don't even get me started on the boob chaffing 🤦🏼‍♀️ Also I feel like my bedroom is like a bloody sauna when Ryan says it's actually not that warm in here. Send help!! Might have to make a quick dash to the kitchen for some toast because I am so bloody hungry! Pregnancy is annoying because I eat my dinner and feel like I'm gonna burst then 30 mins later I'm as hungry as a horse again!!! Can someone make me a chicken dinner with sweet potato mash please and lots of gravy 👍🏻 @emilymallott_ probs a good job Mandy wasn't in, I've seen her face when a dog had weed on the carpet before 😂 @emilymallott_ omggggg can't believe I missed this!!!!! What did Mandy do?! 😂 Does anyone actually still update their twitter feed using an online browser? Feels so weird, I don't like it D: what a surpirse, @bt_uk STILL haven't managed to refund me the correct amount. Only been trying to sort this since August.... @sylvester_dt im sure once I'm in full labour and pushing I won't care, it's just before that I'm gonna feel awkward! It's only just hit me, that in a few weeks, im going to have random people examining my foofoo 🙈 how about I check my own dilation? 😂 @kateltmarler mummy youtubers, beauty youtubers, people who daily vlog that kind of thing I need some new youtubers to sub to. Any suggestions?????!!!?? 36+1 doesn't look like the bum is growing outwards as much now, but it's definitely getting… https://t.co/SRPQi7iIY9 Every time I watch one born every minute Bean wriggles around. It's like s/he can sense there's loads of women in labour 😂 Here's to hoping i don't go I to labour today. Ryan is in reading, my parents are in London and my brother is in Lincoln #stranded No amount of pillows is working. 4 weeks and hopefully Bean will be here. Please don't let me go 2 weeks over! 🙏🏻 Im at that stage in pregnancy now where there is nothing I can do to make myself comfortable in bed. This bump is rock solid now 🤰🏼 @PandoraStruggle I only wear it on one wrist but have managed to do it on both. Took some trial and error but can do it quick as a flash now @PandoraStruggle i mean closest to me 🙈 @PandoraStruggle on my leg with the clasp end furthest away from me. Easy peasy @PandoraStruggle yeah I can, are there people who can't? 🤔 Glad I could be part of the poo fiasco again 😂 @lizzgeorgia @lizzgeorgia in your legs? I'm still getting it!! I need to buy 2 pandora clips for my bracelet but need help choosing... 2 diff colours or 2 of the same 🤔 and which… https://t.co/3W6qfAv8qi @lizzgeorgia 👀 RT @laurDIY: who's stupid idea was it for instagram to refresh the app if you exit out of it for a sec like are u trying to ruin my lurking Hungry but dunno what to eat 🤔 don't even know what I fancy. Just know I need food NOW! I used to love having baths but being heavily pregnant and laying on your back isn't fun! So proud of my progress! That's about 10 hours work tho 😱 https://t.co/WlUCkyFVpD Being doing my cross stitch but now the natural lights gone my left eye won't focus properly. Hope I don't need glasses 🤓 Day 2 of maternity leave spent in my room being a lazy hobbit 😐 @robb_wyatt cuz you've been spray tanning yourself to the colour of a wotsit 🙄 @lizzgeorgia thank you 😘 @kateltmarler no, Adams first car has been sitting on the drive unused for 7 months  because he doesn't want to part with it😂 @lizzgeorgia @_RyanLegg we feel honoured 🤗 @lizzgeorgia @_RyanLegg fajitas on a Saturday 😱 you feeling okay? 😂 How cute is this little snow suit that we bought Bean 😍 #bean #pregnancy #pregnant https://t.co/TvcCdbjLAn @kateltmarler apparently it was more to do with the tubes and not being cleaned regularly enough 🤔 @kateltmarler WHAAAAAT?! I even double checked with the midwife because I love them so much and she said I could get food poisoning! @kateltmarler no they told me I wasn't allowed any soft serve ice cream whilst pregnant coz of the bacteria in the machines @lizzgeorgia I'm holding you to it! 🍦 Right so who would like to volunteer to go get me a mcflurry as soon as Bean has come? 9 months without one has be torture 😫 One more shift left and then that's it for a whole year! Going to miss the Tommy Gang 😢 Got some reading material for the start of my mat leave next week! And Ryan's hand because he… https://t.co/nYl9S5IJPr Awake for an hour and a half now.

We're so excited to meet our… https://t.co/ECD5746w03 Last week at work before maternity leave. Let's do this 💪🏼 Seriously considering not wearing any makeup today as it'll all be washed off in 5 mins with my streaming eyeballs 🤧 To go with my cough I now have a massive headache, blocked sinuses and streaming eyes. Fab. 😖 Still awake. Still uncomfortable ☹️ I am literally so wide awake. 👀 Being pregnant means not being able to sleep or get comfortable. Driving me mad 🙃 #pregnancyproblems Just tried our new 'quilted' loo roll from lidl. More like sandpaper! Yowch!!! Now to have a nice long bath 🛁 I flipping needed that sleep tho! Just woken up 🙊 33+3 getting big now! #pregnant #pregnancy #bean https://t.co/j4Zs2TtCXq 7 shifts left of work... why are they taking so long 😩 RT @GraceFVictory: Another day, another morning I'm struggling to wake up 😂😩 Such an awful nights sleep 😴 Bean is so wide awake 😫 Ryan had eaten a whole packet of salami with chilli mayo. Is this weird? ‘You’re blooming nicely!’ https://t.co/M5NeMdH3RA https://t.co/85HfYnFenJ Surprise surprise issue still hasn't been sorted after being one the phone for 31 minutes @bt_uk Less than 50 days till my due date. When will Bean arrive? And as I predicted, @bt_uk STILL HAVENT sorted out my problem! This is a never ending saga!!! Been going on since September! What a joke! In one of those moods where I wanna be really productive, but I also just wanna lay on my bed all day. Do you see my problem? @lizzgeorgia squashing the baby! @lizzgeorgia back ache and my ribs hurt etc if I stay on one side too long. Plus bean normally sleeps on my left so feel like I'm.... @lizzgeorgia dunno how they expect us to only sleep on left wide because I love around in my sleep all night alternating sides coz I get... @lizzgeorgia had a look and it says left side just maximises blood flow as long as you don't sleep on back or belly either side is fine @lizzgeorgia no one told me that... @lizzgeorgia are we not supposed to sleep on our right side?? @dollybowbow have a surprise! I'm 33 weeks and didn't find out. Adds to the excitement! Then Riki can tell you when the baby is born! @GraceFVictory the uncircumcised willy bit was hilarious 🤣 @emskills27 too easy 🙄 No idea how I'm gonna make it to midnight tonight 😴 32+2! Just want my bubba to be here already! https://t.co/WWex7VT5ZT Sitting in the car dreading going into work 😭 One customer called me an idiot. How pleasant 🙃 Retail during December is such a shit show. Fed up of stroppy customers and people trashing the shop 😤 @lizzgeorgia it's new to us lol it's a 56 plate @lizzgeorgia his car is old too lol only thing getting me through today was the thought of having the leftovers from yesterday. No lie there is enough for a full xmas dinner Sitting waiting for the windscreen to de-mist. Bring me the fiat/ first back. #oldcarssuck 10 hour shift turned into an 12 hour shift. #killme Also I can barely keep my eyes open so I'm definitely not winning today 😴 Technically only 2 and a half hours left of my shift. The shop is a tip, so looks like it's gonna be a late one 😫 Can't wait to get home away from this Boxing Day Sale hell! The bath is calling me! 🛁 @emskills27 🤣 @robb_wyatt oi you cheeky git!

Everyone is telling… https://t.co/1lLMXylyZ3 Yay there's a pregnant emoji now! 🤰🏼 @kateltmarler I didn't have any in the end, but I'm gonna have some cake after dinner tonight! Just got the taste for Victoria sponge cake. 😋 would it be wrong to go and buy some for breakfast? 😅 Do they want someone going into the back of them like I nearly did? 😤 Sorry but since when is it okay for a car to stop on the moddle@of a roundabout because it can't decide which exit to take?! Flap sake, the heartburn had returned 🙄 5 weeks left of work then maternity leave kicks in 🙌🏻 Had a dream I had a Skype call with @GraceFVictory , why did I have to wake up?! 😩 My half an hour nap turned into a 2 and a half hour sleep, and I've woken up feeling sick and dizzy. #why Woken up with such a headache this morning 😖 The tiredness is coming back in the 3rd trimester. Can barely keep my eyes open on my lunch break! 😴 #pregnancyproblems @lizzgeorgia I used to just eat dry crackers or a cereal bar! I couldn't manage much! Fruit? That's quite easy to go down xx @lizzgeorgia thank you for having me! Had a lovely time :) hope @hammerben313 isn't too bored about hearing about labour tho 😂 @lizzgeorgia need me to get anything else while I'm there? Xx @lizzgeorgia only if you're sure! @lizzgeorgia don't you want some alone time with your hubby?? @lizzgeorgia I'll watch them for you, although don't finish till 7... @lizzgeorgia yeah especially when I put my hand there and I can feel him/ her squirming around. Very weird feeling!! @lizzgeorgia I can actually feel Bean moving around now, not just kicks, like all the turning around, it's so weird!! Still tries breastfeeding it though... it didn't like it 😹 Had a dream that I had the baby last night... it was a cat @_RyanLegg love you 😘 @kateltmarler do you have the windows open when drying washing? @_RyanLegg pro housewife and stay at home mummy in training 👊🏻 @GraceFVictory can we just be best friends already? Your advice videos are life 🙌🏻 so down to earth! @lizzgeorgia how did the Heart apt go? Ahhh you'll get to here the heartbeat 😍😍 @lizzgeorgia yeah got a consultant appt in 10 mins :) when's your next apt? @lizzgeorgia that's a bit better then :) @lizzgeorgia same! Although managed to get back to sleep until now 🤗 @kateltmarler they are blind as a bat then! @lizzgeorgia apparently Dotty p's are selling some nice Lacey maternity dresses ATM, there might be a black one you could get? Can't work out if it's vertigo I'm getting or morning sickness. The body is so confusing when pregnant! Please don't tell me the morning sickness is returning 😖 Bean hasn't even been born yet and s/he wakes me/keeps me up with all of this kicking! 👶🏼💥 Why are BMW drivers absolute tools?! Or Bean clearly thinks I have a fab voice and was having a rave to twinkle twinkle little star? Tried singing Bean to sleep... started kicking like mad in what I can only assume is protest? Why does Bean always think this time of night is an appropriate time to practice their Kung fu moves? #pregnancyproblems @lizzgeorgia oh no how annoying :( @lizzgeorgia wow you must have a serious case of baby brain! Still no luck on the purse then :( @BTCare it seems to be getting sorted now, but was meant to cancel my account 2 months ago and still not done! Still being charged 😡 Why is nothing ever simple with @bt_uk ?! A lot of people clearly need some training. Constantly messing me around 😡 @lizzgeorgia what's up? The more pregnant I get, the more is miss @_RyanLegg when he isn't around 😢 Pregnancy has made me feel for women who have had big boobs all their life. Mate my back is in agony, I'm not used to big basoomas! @dollybowbow H&amp;M!! I've got a pair that are super duper skinny. I love them 😍 @_RyanLegg ahhhh you're the best xx @_RyanLegg why did you send his twice? 😂 @_RyanLegg yeah but you didn't have to xx @_RyanLegg you sorted out the bathroom, the bedroom. Organised our new car, replacement tyres. So much! You are the best xxxx Okay maybe that's a bit of an overstatement... I wish I had made plans Also, I always look forward to my days off, then I have them and I'm so bored I wish I was back at work 😂 Need to go into town, but I'm too lazy. Do you see my problem? He completely tidied the bathroom (the bath was full of junk that I didn't know where to put) and he's sorted out our bedroom. True love 💝 My husband is literally the best one there ever was @_RyanLegg 😘 And I say stroke, because it didn't feel like a kick, it felt like a hand stroking my belly. The little cutie! I got a bit hormonal earlier, and I swear Bean knew because it was like s/he gave me a little stroke as if to be like it's okay Mum 👶🏼😘 Boiler still isn't working properly. That shower was like playing Russian roulette 😨 @kateltmarler evil! Although no idea when we are going to be able to do ours as I'm working all weekend and ryan is on lates today &amp; tomoz 😭 Bean is deffo having a growth spurt, measuring above the line at the moment 🙈 Wonder how long I'll end up carrying my wee sample around in my hand bag this time #pregnanyproblems Why does Bean think it's play time?? 👶🏼🤔 In need of a serious hair cut. My hair looks like it's been dragged through a bush 😫 @lizzgeorgia i held his nose but must have squeezed it too hard as he woke up all huffy at me 😂 Ryan has also started snoring in the last few weeks and it's driving me crazyyyyyy 😵 Also why am I still wide awake? 😟 Plus he is radiating the same amount of heat as the sun and it's unbearable 😨 I need my space! Having a king size bed is pretty pointless when your husband chooses to sleep directly next to you... Tesco express is open though... but can I be bothered to drive there 🤔 I really want some chocolate and the shops are shut, do you see my problem? 140 characters is deffo. It enough for a tweet. Give us 10 more characters and I'll be a happier tweeter 😁 Why do I find it outrageous that shops close early on a Sunday when it's my day off, yet find it ridiculous that we have to work when I'm in This Black Friday I have picked up some mega deals. The latest one being.... an electric breast pump 😂 #pregnancyprobs I swear being tall is making the gravitational pull worse aswell. Who wants to come carry my bump for me all day? 😆 Also I swear this baby has put on about 3 stone over night! Feel like I'm carrying around d a bowling ball today #PregnancyProbs Feeling absolutely massive today 🌚 #PregnancyProbs Cracked me right up. Screaming her head off and she wasn't even the one having the blood done 😂 Out comes the mum, 'see it wasn't even for you!' In the queue for a blood test and can hear a little girls screaming and distressed in the room. Poor little thing... @emilymallott_ I got I'd for a scratch card a few weeks ago 🙄 @HannahFarmery missing my baby shower 😡 @HannahFarmery I did think of you when I was watching planet earth 😂 Had my dinner but I'm STILL hungry #why The home stretch https://t.co/AMMd9MiA7T @lizzgeorgia uh oh! Did you get to work on time? 26+3. The bump is growing by the day! #pregnant #pregnancy #bump #trimester2 https://t.co/odMRRwkRwC @murphchar I literally tweeted the same thing last night 😂 does my head in!! Bean is going to be a little fashionista 💃🏼#baby #pregnant https://t.co/RwdWOVcmxO 23 mins late and counting... To clarify, I was not late to my apt. They are just taking their sweet time to see me... Why is it okay for healthcare providers to take 10 years to see you but if you're 2 mins late you get told off?? Ha hmm a positive body day today! At least being pregnant means no wobbly belly. Stretched to the max, it looks airbrushed 😅 @kateltmarler yes!!! Or generally instead of genuinely... or off instead of 'of' like come on people!!!! People who cannot spell simple words really irritate me 😖 Or maybe I've just got gestational diabetes from the amount of sweets I've been eating 😅 Pregnant life means needing a wee every five minutes, even if you've literally just been 😩 What pregnancy has taught me https://t.co/6oKOE3HEqR @emskills27 ask nana to knit us both one! Pregnancy besties 💕 https://t.co/iQNi4rJM5C Never manage to do anything productive on my days off 😩 Managed to get my pregnancy belly bar back in 🙌🏻 yummy mummy status reinstated 😂 #pregnancyproblems Beans morning kickboxing session has begun 🤕 I know I shouldn't complain, but the heating is cranked up so high in this house it's like living in a furnace! 🔥 @lizzgeorgia I thought the same! Love these little men 😍 #sonny #Arthur #brothers #cute https://t.co/96GrtjTUiL So my dad has just said that since I've been pregnant I remind him of Wayenetta...look it up on YouTube. Don't know whether to laugh or cry😂 @kateltmarler the world has to go mad before Jesus comes back... we are one step closer 😀 Having a food baby, when you're growing an actual baby is so painful 😖 Not sure what Bean is doing, but I feel like I need to do the biggest burp ever to relieve the discomfort #sitstill I only had 2! Not 3!!! Who am I kidding? Of course it is, I'm pregnant 😂 Is it acceptable to have 2 more slices??? Had 3 slices of toast for dinner... still hungry 😟 I wonder what it is that makes Bean this bed time is the time to wriggle around the most? #theresapartyinmyuterus @_RyanLegg I need dis 😱 https://t.co/qz1lCq1all Went to a firework display for the first time in years tonight. Some were so loud it sounded like a bomb! Poor Bean kept kicking me 😂 So Adam felt the baby kick the other day. His reaction 'arghhhh that is so weird!!!!!!' And proceeds to run to the other side of the room 😂 @lizzgeorgia love you 😘 Nearly 6 months pregnant and still can't believe how blessed we are to be having a baby 👶🏼😍 @_RyanLegg Being an ASM means never having a peaceful lunch break 😰 @lizzgeorgia 😳 did sonny say that?! @isabellalorx we've had the heating on for at least 3 weeks! #pregnancyprivileges 💁🏼 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 yep ryan has said the same, I better not do it on my own... 👀 All the screws for our new bed! Send help 🆘 https://t.co/s3GA15vFoW @lizzgeorgia my brother finishes at 5 so hopefully we can get it done between us 🙏🏻 I'm just itching to get it done now tho 😂 @lizzgeorgia doesn't finish till 10 😩 @lizzgeorgia ordered from 2 separate places, but all has arrived now 😁 only thing is no one to help me build it now 😭 Who wants to come and help me build my new bed? 😇 Bed has arrived. Now to wait for the mattress 💤 Just got home wth my McDonalds breakfast missing part of my order 😡😡😡 @McDonalds Something is stuck in the washing machine drum. My mum and Dad are away and I have no idea where to start with getting it out 😫 @lizzgeorgia that's why I refused to pay a tenner for it lol xx @lizzgeorgia I wasn't paying a tenner for a slot, even then it would mean waiting between 12&amp;6 🙄 @lizzgeorgia the volume bothers me because ryan is deaf and doesn't hear it and it goes on forever and I have to kick him lol Feel like I've got a bowling ball stuffed up my tummy and it's about to burst open. #pregnancyproblems @lizzgeorgia give it the sniff test. Is it a best before or use before? Only 24 weeks pregnant and bending over has already become a problem. Can I just wear flip flops till Feb? 😖 Having to wait in from 7am-6pm for our new bed. Praying I get an early delivery slot 🙏🏻 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 I swear this is some sort of husband disease. Ryan always had his whacked up full volume 😡 So tired I can barely keep my eyes open 😴 @lizzgeorgia 🤔 My dad live streamed while they rode on the Vampire ride and you can hear my mum screaming #hilarious My mum and dad have been together for 28 years so wanted to re-live one of their first dates. So they've gone to Chessington 🎢🎡 @_RyanLegg now you know how I feel!! 23+3 Bean is growing 😍 https://t.co/k2xUoMjFhf Just ordered or new king size bed and mattress 😍 Watching peoples Florida vlogs is making me want to go so bad :( not until Bean is at least 2 tho :( Morning kicking session from Bean had commenced 👶🏼 Baby bump made my tights keep slipping down yesterday. Therefore today I am a superhero... that's right knickers over the top of my tights 😂 Not quite sure how I managed to flick toothpaste in my eye.... but let me tell you. Mint in the eye flipping stings!!! 😭 @lizzgeorgia 😈 @lizzgeorgia 👀 @CharlieGreenCG my parents rose bushes beg to differ... Wound up doesn't even cover it 😤 @emilymallott_ still cracking up 😂 Bean is always the most active when it's time for bed. 🙊 The beauty of pregnancy… https://t.co/wUllXHWGsj Bean is clearly having a fun time this morning. Kicking all over the place. Little monkey! Definitely enjoying pregnancy in the second trimester. Feeling all the kicks is simply amazing 😍 Still can't believe me and Ryan are going to be a Mummy and Daddy 😱 keep growing Bean, we can't wait to meet you! ❤️ Just woken up. Definitely needed that lay in after the week I've had 😓 Nothing like a 12 hour shift and a shop move when you're pregnant 😰 As the days go on it's amazing how much stronger Bean's kicks are getting ❤️ My soul mate! Love taking on the world with this one. He makes me laugh until I cry. Never a… https://t.co/hGaFmeuYDF 21 weeks and I feel massive! 🙈 so many people are convinced there's 2 in there! 😂 #pregnant… https://t.co/B9frgN4DjJ @lizzgeorgia woooo!

Can't wait to see Bean tomo 👶🏼😍 Proper want a mcds or KFC 😋 Pregnancy combined with being cold gives a whole new meaning for a certain body part to be able to 'cut glass' 👀 @isabellalorx bit annoyed he's alive tbh 🙊😂 @isabellalorx I did think that! Well done you for keeping a straight face 😂 @isabellalorx episode 22! As soon as Blair had a shocked face I knew What was coming, but still!!! @isabellalorx OMGGGGGGGGG shockkkkk xoxo 💁🏼 @lizzgeorgia oh no! :( You're probs bored of me tweeting about my little Bean, but I'm a proud mother and I'm gonna shout it from the roof. I'm pregnant and proud😂 It is literally so weird being able to feel exactly where the baby is sitting now 👀 Every time I feel a kick I can't help but smile 😍 Bean is definitely awake, wriggling around so much this morning 👶🏼❤️ @emskills27 this is me about 10 times a day #pregnancyproblems 😬 😂 https://t.co/1L0v3fPil1 @_RyanLegg didn't tell me you got s costa/Starbucks you cheeky sod! @lizzgeorgia it's not super posh so maybe not... lol. @lizzgeorgia back in time Chelmsford!!!! @lizzgeorgia soul sisters 👯 Having to go into work on your day off must be one of the 'perks' of being a manager 🙄 @lizzgeorgia spooky 💀 @lizzgeorgia so weird, I tweeted the same thing earlier 👽 I wanna scream, and shout and let it all out... me when someone tells me some good news 😂 Being able to see your baby move inside of you is the weirdest and best thing ever 👶🏼😍 @lizzgeorgia me tooooooo 😁😁😁 A week off of work and now my belt will not go through the first belt hole 😂 #pregnancyproblems RT @lizzgeorgia: Had such a lovely evening with @MrsLegg_ @_RyanLegg @hammerben313 🍝👶🏼🍦🎮 Literally feel like the baby could just fall out with the way it's pushing 🙈 If the baby could stop pushing down on my bladder that would be fab #pregnancyproblems @LouisePentland science museum!!! All I want right now is a roast dinner followed by a nap 😴 I've been doing this for an hour, surely I deserve a break now? There is now loads of free space to walk around our bed room, just a shame all the stuff is now on the bed 🙃 https://t.co/Y1gE2h6Nzy This is what happens when you stock up on tampons the end up falling pregnant the month after #CrazyTamponLady https://t.co/Cyc8ku0ZF8 But I do find that whenever I tweet saying I don't wanna get up I find the energy to do it. #ReversePsychology Laying in bed procrastinating because cba to sort out all our stuff from the move 🙃 Driving through Camden as a passenger is making me rip my hair out. Hate to think how Ryan is feeling as the driver! #londontraffic @lizzgeorgia that's what I've got but the actual bar is skinnier than a normal bar and it keeps trying to heal around it and getting stuck 😞 @emskills27 jealous 😩 And because it was too tight it started to get infected. Gross 🙅🏼 #pregnancyproblems Had to take my belly bar out yesterday because the pregnancy bar was too tight. I'm not gonna be a yummy mummy now 😭 @Pixiwoos @Zoella no way are you 39 Sam 😱 So baby brain has made me throw my phone in the bin. Good job I sort of remembered doing it 💁🏼 Why am I awake?! And why can't I get back to sleep? 😩 @lizzgeorgia let me guess... unpacking is the first? Haha @lizzgeorgia I've been trying to sort this packing out. It's not been going very well :( Literally had such a boring day!!!! RT @dizzybrunette3: Jennifer Aniston right now... https://t.co/vNrKPadzht @_RyanLegg I was hobbling back up the stairs like an old lady!! Was in so much pain! Still missed the truck 😩 all that pain for nothing!!! Running down the stairs to put the recycling out as I can hear the truck. Bash my arm, get stuck on the door handle and bruise my bum... @HannahFarmery it's a good job I love people touching my bump! Haha One load of washing on. A third of the washing up done, surely it's time for a break now? 😬 How shall I tidy my house? Not sure whether to do it room by room, or just make all rooms a little bit tidier each? 🤔 Trying to psych myself up to tidy this bomb site of a house. 🤗 I've given it a few days but I still really don't like the people emojis. Bring the old ones back :( @lizzgeorgia wow what a scene that must have been! Bless you all 😘 @lizzgeorgia why were you crying??? Am I the only one who can't stand Mel and Sue from GBBO?! It's so weird, some days I feel so pregnant and then other days I just forget. Is that normal? 🤔 I've been watching videos like this for the last 10 minutes, and I am not sorry 😂 https://t.co/HfbSkdpgNC Also knowing we don't have any bread and I can't have a bacon sarnie is just devastating Need to get up and start packing for our house move, but it's just too cold to get out of bed 😨 RT @alicespake: I love when people FINALLY show their true colours... 🐸☕ https://t.co/7MTqhGizdx @_RyanLegg hmmmm that was you yesterday 🤔 The truth always comes out in the end #justsayin' 💁🏼 Trapped nerve in my shoulder. I just wanna get back to sleep ☹️ @lizzgeorgia well hope you have a lovely weekend x @lizzgeorgia it woke him up and really panicked him @lizzgeorgia yeah I think since the really bad one hit Braintree a few years ago he hates them. Cos the lightning sounded like a bomb and... @lizzgeorgia Ryan doesn't really like storms so glad he's still asleep x @lizzgeorgia early start for Thomas land?? @lizzgeorgia I've only been awake for about 20 mins so haven't really heard much of it tbh. But it still woke me up lol. Ryan is soundo lol @lizzgeorgia did the storm wake you too? It's so weird. No matter how low the rumbles, the thunder always wakes me up. #stormlover @GraceFVictory I prefer your chatty videos, the first video I ever watched was you trying American candy! Do more stuff like that or tags :) Can someone come and fix our air con please because this heat is unbearable 😩 @hammerben313 @lizzgeorgia well no one is a 10 😅 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 uhoh a 6 just doesn't cut it Ben 😆 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 we'll be is broody lol @lizzgeorgia it was probs autocorrect anyway haha and don't be silly have one more and it can be a girl 👶🏼🎀 @lizzgeorgia I didn't know you grew planets 😅 @_RyanLegg ruuuuuuuude Why am I awake? 😩 Is it too early for bed? Most pregnant people seem to hate people touching their bump. Then there's me flexing everyone I see to give it a rub 😂 @lizzgeorgia it was a home, gonna put it in before I go to sleep though :) I'm also working the entire weekend so I'm just about ready to give up on life 👌🏻 When you have a massive headache and a massive list of jobs that need doing at work #saveme Finally treated myself to a new bag! My other one had a hole in the corner and the handle was coming away 🙈 @kateltmarler God is good!! Makes it easier to tell the difference aswell because babies can look so similar when they're that small! @kateltmarler can't believe how different they look! Ordered some pregnancy belly bars this morning, still gonna be a yummy mummy, I wanna be a cool mum 😎 @lizzgeorgia I was dreading buying some cos I assumed they would be mega expensive but I know h&amp;m is in my price range 🙌🏻 @lizzgeorgia didn't even know h&amp;m did maternity jeans!!! Deffo going chelmo after tomorrow's midwife appointment! @lizzgeorgia yeah I know what you mean, all the jeans are basically low rise!!! Although we do have some boyfriend fit ones in now 💁🏼 I did also get up early on my day off and cook my hubby some breakfast so it's well deserved... Right? I've done most of the washing up and a load of washing is on, surely it's time for a break? 😇 @lizzgeorgia I always buy my jeans from h&amp;m tho 😁 @lizzgeorgia thought you loved you Tommy jeans girl?! Started watching Stranger Things last night... Don't really see what all the hype is about though? Totes gonna continue with this #pregnancyproblems hashtag. Gives me something to do 😂 Okay so my dreams have been super weird and vivid lately. Pregnancy does weird things to your body #pregnancyproblems RT @Y2SHAF: so annoying when someone answers a text with 'haha or aha'. like are you the Sahara desert???? send me a dry text like that aga… @lizzgeorgia because they are horrid people! Drives me flipping nuts! Waking up with uterus pains is not the one. A stretching uterus makes period pains feel like a tickle #pregnancyproblems @lizzgeorgia what do you need help with? Get up and go! https://t.co/0wjzMZICW8 Time to get up and do some tidying 😴 I've left it there because there is no way I am going anywhere near that thing! Looks like no toilet breaks for me today! I found that out whilst sitting on the loo. It was in the doorway!!!! I had walked past it unknowingly TWICE Ryan found the dead spider this morning. He said he wasn't picking it up. He was telling the truth. It's been a while... And it's about to happen. Time to get ADDICTED #hayday https://t.co/CYLpvF9EEK He says it's dead but I'm saying pics or it didn't happen 😩 In Ryan's attempt to kill a spider he has now lost it and I am currently fearing for me life 😬 @GraceFVictory preach! 🙌🏻 can't even remember the last time I watched favourites etc! I love your videos because you're so open &amp; honest! RT @LucyAndLydia: Haha this gif Zoe! 😂 https://t.co/k0mC6nN8C8 @isabellalorx fumin' 😡 Can someone please invent a decent pain killer for pregnant people please 🙏🏻 @_RyanLegg Bean loves you 👶🏼 RT @_Snape_: Remember to be at Platform 9¾ no later than 11 o'clock in the morning tomorrow. Is it possible to love a to show but also hate it at the same time, because that's what I'm feeling right now 😑 #PLL SERIOUSLY?!?!?! I HAVE TO WAIT 7 MONTHS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED 😤 Who am I kidding, it's me who's the 🐷 not the 👶🏼 #whatthebabywantsthebabygets And when I say cow I don't mean I'm eating loads of meat, I mean I'm eating crisps, sweets and chocolate 😩 When the first 3 months of pregnancy have put you off food it's totally understandable that I can now eat a cow a day?? #gonnagetfat @isabellalorx I've not even watched today's one and I am fed up with it! Too many cliff hangers! Doin me head in 😲 Sometimes I literally have no words for what goes on in adult life sometimes 😂 @lizzgeorgia that's hilarious! 😂 @lizzgeorgia he's out on a pokéwalk atm otherwise I would have lol When you've got a banging headache and your pillow feels like a rock 😖 @lizzgeorgia best friend 😘 Food, glorious food! https://t.co/epqkZ8xSPz @GiselleSummers3 yeah starting to feel a lot better now thank you 😘 When it takes you a good 10 minutes to take all your pregnancy vits and minerals because your gag reflex just wants to bring them all up 👌🏻😩 Lovely spontaneous night in with @lizzgeorgia 💖 not sure how 2 girls find so much to talk about 🙊 RT @lizzgeorgia: Always feel like *ahhhh sigh of relief* once I've had a night of putting the worlds to right with @MrsLegg_ #chilled I always look forward to my lunch hour because it means I get to eat. But dread it because I lose all my mojo for the rest of my shift 😩 @dollybowbow that's gone so quick! I still remember your labor vlog! @hammerben313 @lizzgeorgia do it, do it, do it, do it! He also said to me "I was thinking about having a water birth"... Does he mean me or him? 😂 Watching One born: Ryan "I'm not looking forward to all the screaming" 😂 @lizzgeorgia whatever is easiest for you. I'll speak to the hubster and see when's best for him too 😁 @lizzgeorgia haha your fajitas are yummy too! Never had a bad meal at yours! But it's deffo our turn to show you what we can do 😬 @lizzgeorgia that's why I kept coming back, I was thinking damn the girl can cook 😋 @lizzgeorgia no probs! Won't be slag Bol tho, I can't compete with yours! 😂 @lizzgeorgia okay no worries X @lizzgeorgia we can always drop some ready meals to you if you want so you at least both eat!!! @lizzgeorgia okay no probs. We'll do it another time for you for definite though! You're always hosting let us be the chefs next time 😘 @lizzgeorgia me and Ryan could always come and cook you something yummy 😋 @lizzgeorgia are you on your own tonight then? @lizzgeorgia same! Now we gotta go Tesco lol @lizzgeorgia that is cray cray @lizzgeorgia good idea X @lizzgeorgia maybe you can go away for a few days in the U.K. Somewhere instead? the lakes maybe? @lizzgeorgia oh no! That's such a bummer!!! Is there no other time you could go? :( @lizzgeorgia why? :( RT @BBCNewsbeat: #GBR finished second in the #Rio2016 #Olympics medal table https://t.co/DqTop9Pp5a https://t.co/1cSAWbtnMm Emma has brought in a batch of the gooiest brownies. I've already had one but surely I'm allowed two because the baby should get its own? 😂 Can't work out if it's my iron that's crap or the ironing board cover... @lizzgeorgia I don't even know if o have a shirt ironed, better go and check 😒 @lizzgeorgia I've done my makeup and I'm just laying on the couch not wanting to get dressed 🙈 Plus these new engorged boobs keep making the buttons pop open and that just ain't a good look 🙅🏼 Next season I'm not choosing any shirts for two reasons: 1️⃣ fed up of ironing them 2️⃣ I'll be too pregnant to fit in them. That was mean to say FOOD pics @lizzgeorgia sounds vomtastic to me 😬 @lizzgeorgia the two worst smells: 1️⃣ cheese on toast 2️⃣ fried mushrooms I have literally laid here for 2 hours whilst Ryan sleeps peacefully. #entertainme @lizzgeorgia can't even stand the smell of being in the same room as someone who's eating it 😷 Looking through my Instagram has made me so hungry. So many good pics!!!! Meanwhile I've got sleeping beauty next to me 😴 @lizzgeorgia sounds good to me! I've also woken up in such a foul mood 😠 @lizzgeorgia wish I didn't have work so could just see you all day 💁🏼 Been awake since 7, really tired but can't get back to sleep. Why 😩 RT @_RyanLegg: Here it is - how cute? 🙊❤️ https://t.co/3tF2xfv6JW RT @_RyanLegg: On the plus side, bought a little outfit for bean (👶🏼) today ❤️😍🙊 RT @_RyanLegg: All I'll say is I've really been let down by people recently 😁 The beauty of pregnancy… Or so I thought! https://t.co/xkkiMN9ADS @lizzgeorgia yeah till 6:30 :( @lizzgeorgia don't be silly! But thank you for the offer 😘 @lizzgeorgia sounds good to me 😜 Can someone bring me some brownies, but they have to be crispy on the outside and gooey in the middle 😁 @lizzgeorgia me too :( @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 yeah I agree!! @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 but look! https://t.co/hyafbZGpLa Really fancy some Cadburys whole nut 🍫 @hammerben313 @lizzgeorgia you get more for your money out there aswell! 🏰 @lizzgeorgia that's madness! @lizzgeorgia haha yes girl 🙏🏻 @lizzgeorgia I know deposits are a killer :( @lizzgeorgia don't be silly! Have a look into these first time buyer schemes, you might be pleasantly surprised! @lizzgeorgia I thought it was gonna be a 2 year plan :( @lizzgeorgia yes you are! You have a plan remember!!! Had such a lovely evening with @_RyanLegg , @lizzgeorgia , @hammerben313 and @BenAllen_94! Never too old for a pyjama party! 💁🏼 Can't work out if I'm hungry or bored... @lizzgeorgia 😂 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 @lizzgeorgia 👀 Waiting for my best friend to tell me she's had her twins is taking over my whole life 😵 @kateltmarler In serious need of a nap 😴 I honestly can't keep up with some peoples mood swings 😶 @kateltmarler yay!

Just wanna stay cocooned in my duvet 😢 I just do a few odds and sods in each room and end up getting bored 😴 It's safe to say Ryan is waaaaay better than me at tidying up.

This is what annoys me about GB Or was that only in 2012 when we hosted the olympics? 🙄 All these people saying they want to leave the country in light of the vote results... Pretty sure you were proud to be part of team Gb... RT @Rikkipayne27: I'm sooooo fricking excited that crash bandicoot is coming out on PlayStation 4 👏😜😀😝🤗 Having such an ugly day today. Even makeup isn't making me feel better 😢 Because I can definitely see that happening... 🙄 I wonder if those voting out will get the result they want and all those who are voting remain are going to send a tirade of abuse again Then when the Tories got in all the labour supports were still moaning and slagging people off When all the Labour Party supporters were slagging off the Tories for voting for Cameron All these people bitching at other people who are going to vote leave is reminding me of the general election.... @emskills27 ummm you need to drink more Mrs Yellow wee 😂 Side note: why have I woken up feeling like I haven't eaten in a week?! Just hope it doesn't wake Ryan, he gets so confused when a storm wakes him up 😞 Love a good thunder storm. The low rumblings woke me up 😏 Been feeling so bloated lately, driving me bonkers!

Lol Sick of my internet being so intermittent lately 😠 @BTCare @lizzgeorgia phew! How bizarre though! @lizzgeorgia what's wrong with it? Normally I love a steaming hot bath but today it actually feels like my skin is peeling off 😐 @emskills27 I've done one lot, just waiting for it to dry... Time for a bath now 🛀 RT @newdayevent: #ND16 Mon 01 Aug - Sat 06 Aug (Go home Sun 07 Aug) https://t.co/f2aFsASt5N https://t.co/V0ERjAtpUS Currently laying on the couch thinking about how much washing up I've got to do 😖 Why on earth am I awake at this time in the morning? 😟 @emmawakers cheeky sod! RT @flvral: thank you Apple for listening to the petty public's demands https://t.co/SGAfw78oDp @emmawakers I wonder if @JacobRolll had anything to do with this... @kateltmarler 🤔 @othersins depends as a woman's size 12 in my shop is a ladies large so you could be in luck I am hungry all the time lately! 🙃 Since my leg day on Saturday, today is the first day I am able to walk without looking like I've pooed myself 👌🏻 Since my leg work out on Saturday, today is the first day that I am able to walk without @lizzgeorgia maybe cos of the muggy weather then ? :/ haha good idea!!! @lizzgeorgia did you wash all the conditioner out properly because I find if I don't my hair is gross 😖 @_RyanLegg what have you done?! @_RyanLegg ??? @lizzgeorgia yay so pleased for you! And after we were talking about it all yesterday! Haha @lizzgeorgia woohoo! Praise God! 🙌🏻 @lizzgeorgia how did you manage it in the end? @lizzgeorgia thanks for having me :) was nice to see the 3 of you again 💕 Not sure how I'm going to cope at work tomorrow... We did a leg workout on Saturday. It's now Monday and I'm still walking like I've pooed myself and my legs keep giving way #unfit So Ryan has finally persuaded me to join a gym and now I've remembered why I was so against joining... @emilymallott_ oh yeah of course! @emilymallott_ why so late?! Looking forward to a day with @_RyanLegg @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 and the boys 😘 Every time I think the summer weather is here is flipping rains!! Got dressed in a summery outfit today and it decides to rain 😠 I did consider wearing some today but there is really no point with hay fever in full swing 😖 Weekends are the best because it means no makeup!!! @KFC_UKI I'm pleased to say that my bad experience with a toaster twister last time was a one off and the one I've just had was delicious 😋 @tangledthorne I love the raised shoulders and the 'mmm' at the end lol bless her Some stuff I see on social media is so vomtastic 😷 Im not totally against PDA, but there is a line. Although the weather forecast is looking pretty rubbish 😑 Just the rest of the day to get through then I've got 3 days off! 🙌🏻 Just had my lunch and I'm still hungry! Thought I'd got away with hay fever this year. Eyes were definitely puffy and scratchy when I woke up today though 😩 @tangledthorne how cool were we?! #NationalBestFriendDay https://t.co/2OmwAQqcff @tangledthorne if you can't drink that early on your wedding day then when else can you? Lol @robb_wyatt not gonna lie I was puckering a bit 😷 @robb_wyatt what the hell they are so weird!!!! I don't get what they are even doing! @robb_wyatt what even are they? Some people 🙄😵💤 @_RyanLegg what more do you want?! @_RyanLegg s whole tray? I'm hungry but got no snacks ☹️ @_RyanLegg they are in the oven as we speak Unfollowing all of these stupid accounts that keep tweeting about it! If I see one more tweet about the Yubl app I'm gonna scream! @lizzgeorgia hate it when I feel like that! @_RyanLegg cute 😘 @lizzgeorgia I was think just us to and the little men, but we can have the big men instead if you want 😁 @lizzgeorgia yes I'm at work :( when are you next free for a catchup? @ellconnelly book me in as well 😘 @emmawakers no because then it would be me who would be trying to figure out how to answer all the work emails 🙃 @lizzgeorgia don't even know why that tweet was sent from my other account. It does that sometimes, stupid thing! @emmawakers no curry sauce all the way!!!!!!! Yes Colchester is a good one! Near the zoo too 🐯🦁🐵🐘 @emmawakers yeah and I'm not too sure how I feel about them putting gravy on chips tbh... Maybe if I turn my phone off and try and sleep that will actually work (it normally does...) Whilst the other is just scrolling through all their social media feeds #romantic Reminiscing if the days when you would stay up till like 2am texting your crush.... Then you marry them and one of you is asleep in bed Husband is peacefully sleeping next to me and I'm just laying here wide awake! Why am I still awake? Can't believe I'm able to stay up this late! (Don't judge i used to be asleep by 9pm) @emmawakers norfolk is the way to go! Cheaaaaap. Or better still Manchester 🤔 @lizzgeorgia so far we haven't had any trouble this week 🙌🏻 @lizzgeorgia the joys of half term lol @lizzgeorgia that's annoying but good you didn't need to call security. Also apparently to get a radio to have to rent one from Freeport... @lizzgeorgia no probs :) did you have some issues) @lizzgeorgia oh right fair enough lol @lizzgeorgia ah that's annoying :/ is it for the boys bday? @lizzgeorgia hobby craft maybe? @lizzgeorgia eBay or Amazon maybe? RT @Mikaela29: What is this weather it's June 😨❄️☁️ When you're craving a Burger King so bad but you know you have to be strong otherwise you'll get mistaken for being pregnant (again) 😂 @emmawakers footballs coming home, it's coming home! (Well we can dream can't we 😂) I am freezing but I am reluctant to turn the heating on because it's June for goodness sake! The silence has been broken! https://t.co/2mB8yjom0m @lizzgeorgia that should do the job with your fertility rate! Haha @_RyanLegg you are awesome! #besthusband @_RyanLegg you've already changed my life forever 😍 Just need some inspiration ☹️ And I don't want to write any old rubbish just for the sake of writing something. I only like to write what I'm please with I have been lacking in ideas for my blog lately. I want to write I just don't know what to write about 🤔 Saw someone I went to school with yesterday... Pregnant. Another girl I used to be really good friends with... Pregnant. WHEN IS IT MY TURN? RT @R4H44B: They finally proved this dress colour after so long smh 🙄🙄 https://t.co/vlrtnXVXbr That's season one of American horror story finished.

Cold wrap!!! Not impressed @lizzgeorgia you've already got two! Let someone else have a turn 😆 Eaten my lunch and I'm STILL hungry 😫 My sciatica is really playing me up lately 😩 #oldwoman On my bed completely ready waiting to leave for work 🤔 How is it that I get up at the same time every day, yet some days I'm rushing around trying to get ready, then others I'm just sitting... Just today to get through then I have 2 days off 🎊🎉 Think im gonna have to resort to eating Nutella from the spoon @_RyanLegg I try 💁🏼 @_RyanLegg you're very welcome😍 @_RyanLegg cottage pie xx @_RyanLegg just needs heating up 😘 @_RyanLegg yeah are you not hungry? @_RyanLegg woohoo! Got your dinner ready for you 🙃 How can I be hungry after my massive dinner? Im thinking boredom is the root of this 'hunger' @meganrhianne @lizzgeorgia that's just rude! Put it back on! I need chocolate! Tried to be healthy but that nectarine just hasn't hit the spot Home is boring when @_RyanLegg is at work ☹️ Crying at the fact that I'm gonna have to hang my washing up #leastfavouritejob @lizzgeorgia @meganrhianne okay show off! 😒😄 @lizzgeorgia @meganrhianne I don't doubt that for one second 😁 @meganrhianne @lizzgeorgia *to be @meganrhianne @lizzgeorgia I think it's meant I be noises... 😳 @lizzgeorgia @meganrhianne Georgia!!!! That is too much for my eyes 😵 @meganrhianne @lizzgeorgia i swear if one more person announces they are having a baby I'm gonna lose it! 😲 @meganrhianne @lizzgeorgia haha! That is very true!! 😂 @meganrhianne @_RyanLegg @lizzgeorgia hopefully he does! 🙏🏻 Looking forward to Sunday night with that gang 👌🏻 @_RyanLegg @lizzgeorgia @meganrhianne Ready for the Oven 😋 https://t.co/V4MOxYj7dm @_RyanLegg what's wrong?

I swear everyone except me is pregnant at the moment #babyboom @simonfromharlow this is cracking me up the never ending satsuma saga 😂 Good bye to my little car Daisy 😔 https://t.co/zKPOvEncQu Should have tweeted earlier as he has just turned up 🙄 Been awake since 7:20 because my car was supposed to be collected between 7:30 and 8. Crying at how much more sleep I could have had 😩 @lizzgeorgia well one of those girl convos, Chinese or no Chinese 😉 @lizzgeorgia need to organise another girly catch up to! Have a good sleep 😘 @lizzgeorgia looking forward to Sunday! 🙌🏻 @lizzgeorgia I'm on the Late too! I'll see if I can pop in and see you when I'm on my break :) I mean the sign language for the alphabet btw... @meganrhianne yes!!!!!! I've been thinking this for ages! The amount of times I delete and redo a tweet 🙄 @lizzgeorgia you go get 'em girl! What shift you on tomorrow? I know the alphabet and he was spelling the words out to me then showing me the actions. Was amazing to be able to communicate like that! A deaf and dumb man has joined our church. So at tonight's meeting he was teaching me sign language. We were able to communicate because... On a Twitter binge atm 🙃 That last tweet was meant to say 'told you there wouldn't be any stupid corrections' do you see what I'm dealing with here?! Told you there wouldn't be Amy's typos corrections! I'm hunrgy but it's too late to eat and we don't have any snacks for me to nibble on :( @lizzgeorgia in that case you crank that heating up full whack! Pamper yourself gurl! Sod's law everything will be typed perfectly but we will see... I'll try to give you an example with my next tweet. I won't correct a single word so you can see what's been happening. How long until my new phone learns what autocorrects it needs to do. So many random words popping up! @lizzgeorgia put another layer on 😜 I have to mute the tv when the intro comes on though because that music just gives me the major creeps Ok so I've watched two episodes of American Horror story now. In one sense it creeps me the flap out on the other I want to watch them all 👀 @emmawakers ah man. How embarrassing! 🙈 @emmawakers how did you do it? @emmawakers that is bad! Just getting the screen replaced or whole phone? Make sure you get tempered glass! Lol @emmawakers is it as bad as mine was? 😬 what you gonna do???!!! @emmawakers oh dear not been a very good week for us has it! How bad is it? @emmawakers 😏 @lizzgeorgia 'This is big brother. You are LIVE on channel 4, please do not swear' lol We're going food shopping later what do we need to buy?? @lizzgeorgia do you have one? @lizzgeorgia you go girl! 👊🏻 @lilypebbles how tall are you? (Good to know when you are modelling clothes) About to start watching American Horror Story 💀 Made me realise what a boring person I am when my answer was eating and watching tv #whoops The other day someone asked me what my hobbies were and I just want into panic mode So I was thinking I wanna start a scrap book. But then I remembered I don't really take any pictures and when I do I don't print them out 🙃 Why do I keep having such weird dreams lately?! Am I watching the same show as the judges?! All of these acts have been CRAP #BGT The mother in laws sharks teeth stash puts  me to shame! Although she has been collecting them… https://t.co/K1cPzVwppy @emmawakers I thought everyone had this crush?! Haha maybe I'm not as normal as I first thought... @emmawakers childhood crush?! Still my crush now 😂 @JeffTurnbull could have invited me 😢 Proper fancy a roast dinner 😩 @lizzgeorgia glad to have you back in the country 😁 @lizzgeorgia made my day seeing you two earlier! 😍 @lizzgeorgia oh right I see! Haha @lizzgeorgia who did it then? lol Buried is literally my worst nightmare! That's why I wanna get cremated, just incase I wasn't dead when they put me in the coffin 😳 I hate films that do this to me!!!!!! @emmawakers I am just about coping. My heart rate just keeps rising! I also keep forgetting to breathe 😨 10 mins in and I can already feel my heartbeat increasing 😬 @lizzgeorgia where did you learn that?! So cool! Watching 'Buried'. Considering I'm claustrophobic not too sure how well this is going to go... No cracked screen but still making typos 😑 @LucyAndLydia i used to do that with my cousin! Find a field and go sit in it and eat the ice cream! Although it does give my cramp in my hands when I hold it 😂 How have I waited this king to upgrade to an iPhone 6? Loving the bigger screen already! @emmawakers dammit! Insta stalking it is then 😏 @emmawakers I thought the surprise was a someone ;) All in a mornings work 💪🏼 #sharks #teeth #Walton https://t.co/zIWj6DEAxN Go hard or go home! 😳 This was how bad the damage was https://t.co/aq36IbNqQ3 It's been a day and I'm getting so fed up of my typos with this dumb screen!!!! I spooned a dog for 2 hours last night and I am not ashamed https://t.co/eaxGqakgq9 Tbf after the 12 years of having phones this is the first time I have ever smashed one and that's pretty good going for a clumsy person New phone has been ordered, also a bomb or off case so I never smash a phone again @emmawakers did I miss it?! ☹️ One of life's hardest decisions is choosing a new case for your new phone 😩 Because let's face it. I was mistyping without the cracked screen and I can barely see what im typing with this new mess Also all my tweets are likely to have typos until I get a new phone... Keep forgetting that I ruined my phone screen and having a melt down when I see it 😩 Ah ma gaaaad! 😳 https://t.co/7YYEPIEQ0i I have just smashed my first ever iPhone. Considering how clumsy I am in surprised this didn't happen sooner... @lilypebbles my friend was so busy right up until the wedding! I didn't want the stress so hardly anything diy related at my wedding! @_RyanLegg rubbing! Walking into work and my shoes are already working #givemestrenth RT @JeffTurnbull: It was great to have all of #TeamTurnbull/Legg together today.

Remember when @instagram said they weren't going to mix up the orders of their posts? Well they've gone and done it now! 😑 @emmawakers definitely! He's now asking what other skin products I have 😏 @emmawakers I let Ryan use my face exfoliater and now he wants one 😂 Okay I've out a load of washing on but the realisation is setting in that I'm gonna have to get up and hang it 😟 So far I've been out for breakfast and slobbed on the couch. 👍🏻 Woke up having plans to get stuff done. Sort out the spare room which is a bomb site. Tidy the bedroom, basically blitz the house... Dying with this muggy air today #cantbreathe @emmawakers just do a season a week.

Hate to think what weird cravings I'll have when I'm pregnant 🙈 @lizzgeorgia I'm probs gonna choose either American horror story or Luther next 🙃 @lizzgeorgia I'm watching prison break atm but nearly finished that so need to find something else haha @lizzgeorgia yes!

These jeans are so tight! Lol how did you do it?! @lizzgeorgia that's what I'm hoping for! They make my butt look good though 😉🍑 Bit creepy... https://t.co/rvJ6h8Jf5f Verdict- spent the best part of 10 minutes trying to pull them up and doing up the flys. Definitely skinny fit 😂 #TommyLife Forgot to try on a pair of jeans before taking then for uniform, had visions of picking up regular fit instead of skinny... I blew my nose and I'm pretty sure it was the nose bleed, not murder 🙌🏻 Woke up with blood all over my hands. Either I killed someone last night or I had a nose bleed 💉 @_RyanLegg it was rather yummy 😋 Was gonna watch hush but chickened out coz I'm home alone lol Need a suggestion for what film to watch on Netflix 🤔 Reminds me of the days when used to catch my dad rummaging through his private stash 😂 @JeffTurnbull  https://t.co/GmIhK6YacZ Also John Travolta was my perfect Danny Zucko so not feeling this other dude 😅 Decided to watch Grease Live. Not bad, sticks to the original script pretty much which I like, but the songs just aren't doing it for me! Halp!! Trying to write some blog posts but lost all creativity.... @DanLoveeeeee your tweets are so deep lately. Where's the fun at?! For those of you who may be interested I write a blog (sometimes more frequently than others) https://t.co/Km4zydo3ms I’m wide awake! https://t.co/w0aQzEBmUI I've got creaky knees today. Whyyyy😖 Getting back into Twitter these last few days. Wonder how long it will last though... Lent has helped me so much which being able to fight my cravings! Day off tomorrow... What to do, what to do 🤔 @robb_wyatt why you ruining my lyf for 😫 Although the trifle is shop bought not homemade like dinner (sorry not sorry) @lilypebbles 3 things I look for; good thumbnail, exciting/ interesting title, how long the video is! Rarely watch anything above 15 mins! @lilypebbles definitely makes a difference! But then again sometimes it an be click bait and that annoys me!!!! @robb_wyatt come and see me soon you smelly shoe 👢 @emmawakers blunt and straight to the point 😂 @GraceFVictory such a shame as you seemed like such a lovely couple! All the best, love you! After he's finished his seconds it's time for some chocolate trifle (he doesn't like the normal kind!) I'll see if I can work on that 😁 So please that the husband enjoyed my cottage pie after saying he didn't like that particular meal 😍 So I didn't get second dinner but @_RyanLegg is making me toast 🤗 @_RyanLegg @hammerben313 Chinese and chocolate (not together, separately) 😁 @hammerben313 @_RyanLegg he already made my first dinner though lol @hammerben313 best see if @_RyanLegg will whip me up another meal 😜 When is it acceptable to have second dinner? I was so hungry that my dinner hasn't even touched the sides! 😩 Bath time now though 😌🛀 Had a busy morning. 2 coffee dates in one day! Back home to strip the bed and do the washing up! Had a nice catch up with some old work colleagues #missedthem @ellconnelly yes! Last time I had one it was too salty 😖 @ellconnelly they are so yummy tho 😋 Still laughing at the fact o was delirious this morning. Convinced is heard Ryan had come back from work 😂 And this is one of the reasons I like my job 😍 https://t.co/kTyI0CU1R7 @lizzgeorgia food to the rescue!!! @lizzgeorgia hope you're feeling better X @_RyanLegg of course 💁🏼 @_RyanLegg happy wife... Happy life @_RyanLegg pizza is almost burnt 😁 @_RyanLegg you started it 😔 I'll be grumpy if you unsub me and throw away my make up. @_RyanLegg then I'll ban you from going to the gym 🤔 @_RyanLegg then I'll sell your consoles 😀 @_RyanLegg I'll cancel it 😘 @_RyanLegg I'm gonna burn it now. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 @_RyanLegg wow I'm tired. I mean wifeislife hahaha @_RyanLegg errrrr don't you mean #pizzaislife ?! Lol @lizzgeorgia thanks chick 😘 missing you at Tommy :( @CharlotteR333 she is so beautiful! Yes all is well here. Hope you are good. Any more wedding plans ? @CharlotteR333 what breed is she? So cute! Been feeling very low lately. Just need the better weather to be here, sun makes everything better! @GraceFVictory if you rub coconut oil mixed with frankincense it relieves pain! I think just coconut oil on its own will help too @lizzgeorgia ooooh tell us!!! Today for lunch I'm having a sandwich. But bit just any sandwich... An M&amp;S sandwich! Trying to get to work early has been a massive fail. #stuckintraffic Really regretting the decision now though #HowWilliGoOn Popped to Tesco on my way home from work and managed not to give into temptation and buy some sweets/chocolate! Did I beat my sugar addiction? https://t.co/PddYUHFvR1 @_RyanLegg ? Also my hair is really annoying me lately. Such a massive frizz ball!! Have felt like a right skank bag ALL day today 😞 @ellconnelly miss you xx Lacking all motivation today :( I've been awake for 2 hours and still achieved nothing... Another lovely sunny day! ☀️ @hammerben313 only through the blinds, heard it crack through the sky though! @hammerben313 I like a storm but that sounded like a bomb went off above my house! That thunder scared the FLAP out of me 😵 Looking forward to having stew and dumplings for dinner 😍 @lizzgeorgia I did wonder why you suddenly replied to a tweet from Friday lol! @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 @emmawakers basically someone needs to have a baby and you've had 2 so might as well have a third! Chop chop! 😁 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 @emmawakers is the coke to dilute the prosecco 😜 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 @emmawakers 😘 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 @emmawakers could have been having a posh glass of water? 😐 The downside to having dinner earlier than normal is that you get that second wind of hunger... Is second dinner acceptable?! 😂 @lizzgeorgia @emmawakers @hammerben313 hmmmm. Can Ben vouch for your prosecco this evening? 😂 @lizzgeorgia @hammerben313 @emmawakers I've heard about you and the beer though 😏 yore always drinking that stuff!! @hammerben313 @lizzgeorgia @emmawakers maybe you didn't know on Wednesday? 😱 @hammerben313 @lizzgeorgia @emmawakers something you're not telling us Georgia?! @lizzgeorgia why do you ask? Update: I did get out bed today and I did 4 loads of washing! Now time for some LBP with the hubster @_RyanLegg Update: still in bed Remember when everyone used to do #ff ?? What happened to that? It was like a Friday ritual! Been awake for nearly 2 and a half hours and I still haven't mustered up the energy to get out of bed! #lazy @Dudedrakes same I hardly ever go on mine but I do still tweet on the odd occasion. I find it's the best for word vomit :) lol Just watched PLL. When will this madness stop?! I can't cope with all these twists and turns!!! 😫 “Worrying won’t get you anywhere” https://t.co/PkIx7nElNR @_RyanLegg ??? Still not had a reply from @kfc about my order mess up! #fumin' @kfc So annoying when you get your 12 piece deluxe banquet home that you've paid 17 quid for and they haven't given you the chips! Feel like today has been so unsuccessful. Slowly slipping I to madness waiting for @_RyanLegg to come home Uninspired… https://t.co/BE0JVL3SNd Really late I the party but definitely don't like this new Twitter feed! Show me them in chronological order!!!!!!!!!!!! 😡😤 Pumping my tyres up for me 😘 @_RyanLegg https://t.co/TifYC8CTIU Sugar addiction? https://t.co/GGiGl2il7o I always look forward to Gracie's uploads! Keeping it real as always!! https://t.co/Hq5gxY1VcE @_RyanLegg only just seen this! You're cute 😘 Absorbing the word https://t.co/RXUPK0HNlG Tried telling him he only needs one but he's not listening! Brothers! They're so old they're now an off white He also thinks it's acceptable to keep 3 white tshirts... Helping my brother clear out his wardrobe, so far he has gotten rid of one old school shirt.:: Another boring afternoon of doing absolutely nothing 👍🏻 Marriage 101 https://t.co/gFfajQqUO3 There's probably loads of stuff I could be doing but I just can't find the motivation! Where I've been busy these last few days I am so bored at home on my own! On second thoughts, not sure if I want to go through nearly 2000 songs on my laptop and figure out which ones I want to keep... My original plan was the clean and tidy the house, but sorting out my I tunes is more important. Right??? @kateltmarler have you turned the water mains off?

I do feel a bit giddy from being over tired though... Also I survived my first stock take at work today. Wasn't as brutal as I thought it would be 😊 How have o never had cookies from @dominos before?! They are AMAZEBALLS!!! 3 loads of washing done and majority of the washing up done.
