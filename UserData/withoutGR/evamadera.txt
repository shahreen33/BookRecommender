Not in this particular tragedy but it's part of my personal exp so on a very diff level I understand @ajlesser I'm very sorry that you've taken this personally. That was never my intention. I speak not to lessen your grief. cont‚Ä¶ @ajlesser @ajlesser inconsistency: you say "unless u have personal connection don't say where u were" then u say http://t.co/CXhyPGueLk @ajlesser can you please read the words I posted. In no instance in this conversation did I ever take offense. Not once. @ajlesser but the statement that started this convo was your irritation at people making this "all about me." Do you see the inconsistency? @ajlesser I am not taking this personally. I am trying to conduct a debate‚Ä¶play devil's advocate. Words have power. @ajlesser but that goes back to my point of generalities. I take issue w/ your original statement which lumps people like me w/those people @ajlesser this is an event that shook an entire nation. I think everyone who is old enough is entitled to post their memories @ajlesser also‚Ä¶did you see the 2nd half of my comment? I remember where I was b/c of the victims dying. How is that self-focused? @ajlesser so social media should be limited only to those who were directly affected? @ajlesser true but your stmt lumped people like me with people who make it all about themselves. I'm not a fan of generalities either way @ajlesser that thousands of people were dying @ajlesser for instance, I remember that I was in math class playing review game &amp; look back on that considering the triviality considering‚Ä¶ @ajlesser I believe that it's possible to both remember the victims and remember where one was on that day @ajlesser why is it wrong for me (or someone like me) to remember where I was that day?

I think blaming Hall is misdirected @heelstriker954 I understand that. My point is, he is not the originator of the hype. I blame the media not the person forced to try (cont) @heelstriker954 you already said that. @heelstriker954 I also have read up on his other results from the year immediately prior. It's only 3ish years past. not that far @heelstriker954 okay, I didn't misunderstand you. good. I've been been following his career since 2nd place finish at '12 marathon trials @heelstriker954 also‚Ä¶why on earth did you copy &amp; paste the earlier post to multiple people? makes you seem like a bot @heelstriker954 i don't understand your cynicism. Did I misunderstand you before when you said that you had just recently heard about him? @heelstriker954 also back in January Ryan finished 2nd by 1 second at Arizona Rock n Roll half. does that count for nothing? .@heelstriker954 good past results &amp; name recognition. coverage should be fair not the hype which garners ridicule from nameless public He ran the whole thing, had a sucky race and finished 20th. Apparently nothing Ryan Hall does is above snarking on. #shorttermmemoryprobs for all those people saying that Ryan Hall hasn't completed a marathon w/out w/drawing since 2011‚Ä¶does no one remember Boston 2014? .@FloTrack why no mention of the overall race leader's any more? If you make time to seek out someone to complain to about a worship leader's outfit b4 the service ends, your focus is on the wrong place.
