Everyone has their favourites @anusrik12 @SKsSuperFanV2 even though u r silently screaming inside, wanting to break free but dnt hv d courage or circumstances to @anusrik12 @SKsSuperFanV2 its not follow ur dream.. It's d courage to b urself in a typecast world. Get up everyday as smone ppl want u to b @anusrik12 @SKsSuperFanV2 I identified with both rockstar n Tamasha.. N Don't compare kjo with imtiaz.. That's like comparing chalk n cheese @anusrik12 @SKsSuperFanV2 I disagree.. He delves into zones no one cares enter.. Only love aaj kal was superficial. @SKsSuperFanV2 n U have been lazy to present it without simplifying. @SKsSuperFanV2 HMm.. wen smone says "Public doesnt understand complex/layered plots", it angers me. 2 simplify a complex thought is hard wrk n for ppl comparing T*****a wid S*******R, my only comment is SK must hv been drunk while signing that movie. It didnot even hv a story Nevertheless kudos to d man for sticking to his vision.. #Tamasha Simplicity has its beauty, as was proved by  #JabWeMet . #Tamasha is complex, wish imtiaz had told d same story in a simpler narrative cntd The power of a storyteller lies in d fact that he can communicate to ppl in d language they understand n #Tamasha is clearly Hebrew for most Such an irony that in d tale about a storyteller, despite everything going for it, its only d story teller who erred. #Tamasha But there is a thin line between genius n eccentric. That's where #Tamasha got struck, on d later side. Cntd. @deepikapadukone in #Tamasha is understated yet powerful, lucid n so real that u forget she is acting. Finally her eyes r doing d talking There is no denying that both @deepikapadukone and Ranbir were marvelous. Especially DP.. I always felt she is OTT, not this tym. Cntd.
