No agreement. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics it is SCOTUS job and they often turn down cases they believe have not reached consensus @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics incorrect. Read the Brown case and Robert George on SSM. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics Yeah, it was called the 19th Amendment. Try to pass a SSM Amendment. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics and read this to begin with: http://t.co/w4VJAZY8wB @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics Doesn't follow at all. 14th Amendment was specifically designed to address race. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics and just because a court rules, doesn't make it Constitutional. Read the history @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics and, again, the lower courts only have "persuasive authority" outside their own district @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics no, refusing to hear a case says nothing about the merits. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics actually most states still uphold natural marriage. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics it has no authority outside its district. The US Constitution covers the entire US. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics that's not my point but where exactly does it state that? Please cite text. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics other courts don't decide the US Constitution. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics no, they sent it back to the 9th circuit . That's all @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics in a democratic republic, if I can persuade the majority, my view prevails regardless @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics nope, that was dicta. The ruling was that the parties did not have standing. Read it. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics however one comes to their moral view in a democratic republic is what is irrelevant @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics if you are referring to the Prop 8 case, they actually only ruled on a standing issue @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics your comparison is fallacious. Do yourself a favor and read this: http://t.co/ygekCx0779 @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics Southern states weren't enforcing 13-15th Amendments.  No Amendment here. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics and all laws have a moral basis, religious or not. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics when a right of conscious held for 225 yrs disappears, by definition = loss of rights. @CounterApologis @SecularOutpost @JMIApologetics i think you should try to actually read the post and think about it before commenting.

I don't think so. @KthTckr if the CEO did so for religious reasons, Mozilla fired someone for a religious opinion, which is arguably a protected class. @KthTckr And there is an argument that Mozilla actually violated their CEO's 1st Amendment right esp. for a private action. @KthTckr AND wrong to support the Green Family for exercising their 1st Amendment rights? @KthTckr So, it is wrong to criticize Mozilla for firing someone who made a private donation leaked by the IRS... @KthTckr the last time I checked, HL had this thing called the Constitution on their side.

The average person in America who calls themselves a Christian does not belong to a church.  Again, read the post @James_McTavish Again, read the post.  I don't have time (I actually have a job) to reprint all 700 words on Twitter for you. @James_McTavish did you read the definition I sent from http://t.co/Gqz2Fbxm5Z? Are there not "atheist churches" and a push for chaplains? @James_McTavish Yet you feel qualified to judge it blindly? @James_McTavish You didn't answer the question. @James_McTavish Really? Did you read the post? @James_McTavish and I doubt you think independently. What do you concede materialism has not and will not solve? @James_McTavish But again, funny how the leading new atheists all do.  Just because  Catholic blogger disagrees with the Pope and bishops. @James_McTavish No, but psychologists don't push for their own "chaplains," start their own churches, hold rallies in D.C., etc. Atheists do @James_McTavish Funny how they all agree with each other on nearly every point. @James_McTavish When will you get to the factual statements? @James_McTavish That's a statement--not an argument.  You're sounding more like a sectarian fundamentalist all the time. @James_McTavish Um, if you read the New Atheists they do in fact agree on more "core facts" than do Christians across denominations. @James_McTavish You didn't answer my question. @James_McTavish "religion: a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects" @James_McTavish So, Buddhism is not a religion?
