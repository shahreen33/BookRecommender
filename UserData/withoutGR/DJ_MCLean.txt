Disney on Ice! (@ Bankers Life Fieldhouse w/ 18 others) http://t.co/k68LcDht58 @vendygirl Uh oh, I started at the top. So, if I keep going I guess I will be disappointed? @vendygirl Yes - it's my first foray into Star Wars literature. Pretty good so far. Now reading Dark Force Rising by Timothy Zahn (book 6 of 2014) #Goodreads #Read26Indy I am excited for Disney on Ice tonight - I am allowed to say this as the father of an almost two year old child! Now reading A Canticle for Leibowitz - classic sci-fi from the 60s #Goodreads #Read26Indy Remember when they used to make all those father/son and mother/daughter switcheroo movies (i.e. Freaky Friday and Vice Versa)?

I get no victories when it matters; all I get is ulcers and disappointment. #Bengals #Reds #Bearcats @WISH_TV Thanks! I appreciate it! I know it is important to share the weather, I was just hoping to not miss any of the game. Hey, @WISH_TV, can you do the weather updates faster so that we don't miss any of the game? Signed, A Bengals Fan. Go #Bengals! My neighbor is snow-blowing my sidewalk and driveway! I didn't even ask - he was halfway done before I even realized he was doing it. Starting the year off with a classic. From what I have heard, though, I may live to regret it! http://t.co/wXSW54MnFe I am glad ABC is showing Billy Joel. Much classier than the two hours of Miley Cyrus we just endured. #HappyNewYear Happy New Year! The books I read in 2013 http://t.co/bf7XCvtZ0j @Vendy Yeah, that should have counted for about 8 books right there! I read 60 books in 2013 - I can't believe I averaged over a book a week! Who thinks I can do it again in 2014? I never thought I would wish the New England Patriots were on TV. #Bengals #GoBills Scrooged! @aj_colley Let me guess who said that . . . Love Actually is on at my house!  http://t.co/4gbLiO2c9w @aj_colley yes! I win the bet! I knew I could get you to respond! Still, if the Broncos win, Colts clinch, so it seems like it should be on. Yes, it makes perfect sense that CBS is showing the celebrity ski fest instead of the Broncos game. #sarcasm Yeah - I am getting yelled at by my family right now. We take what we can get! Go #Bengals! A friend of mine just made this - so true! #Bengals http://t.co/xfzKxWjG54 @aj_colley @ar_smithson @PewBacon yeah, those blue stripes pretty are pretty silly! Who Dey!

Sad - #Bengals game not on in Indy because CBS cannot show a game at the same time as the #Colts on FOX. @aj_colley With as much as you save, you could probably go to 4 #Pacers games a month! @aj_colley Ha! Well, not me! We have been reducing our package to save money - I can just watch the stats on my phone. Thanks for the info! @aj_colley Terrible! Some of us are more interested in the CBS advertised matchup between the Bengals and Ravens. I wonder the purpose? @aj_colley that's what the commercials are saying. Could it be because the Colts are on at the same time on Fox? @aj_colley do u know why WISH has no football game at 1 on Sunday? They have commercials for the Bengals game, but it isn't on the schedule. Happy Halloween day 2 - let the Trick or Treating begin! It takes a special kind of masochist to be a Cincinnati sports fan #Bengals #Reds Ladies and Gentlemen - I give you Giovani Bernard! #Bengals Go Bengals! Thriller on the way to work. Good way to start #Halloween! Oh wait . . . there was still baseball going on . . . More old school horror movie sweetness. Just partook in Craven's The People Under the Stairs. @bethpratt I am not ashamed! Just watched Pet Semetary and it was awesome in all of its 80s-ness and provided some decently gruesome scares. Nice clutch win for your team @IndyMarisaK #Lions First Christmas commercial . . . Finger pinched by angry crab today - mark that off the bucket list! #Bengals win the Big Cat Bowl! Wish I could see #Bengals #Lions game, stats on my phone not doing it justice @IndyMarisaK @IndyMarisaK I hope yours does to - I just wish I could watch it! Yahoo says #Bengals #Lions is game of the week right behind #Colts #Broncos - it must be getting cold in a very hot place! @IndyMarisaK @IndyMarisaK Yeah, but now our teams are both kinda good - scary! @IndyMarisaK I am a Bengals fan, I have been prepared to lose for years! Keeps my disappointment level low when I don't expect much! ;) Ready for the Big Cat Bowl next Sunday? #Bengals #Lions @IndyMarisaK Read this! This is important! #shutdown http://t.co/t3M01UqAxE Augering: In some ways it makes digging holes easier, in other ways it makes it harder! Well, look at that, the #Bengals are trying to make us feel good about Cincinnati sports . . . Dusty Baker - yer out! #Reds http://t.co/faYm2H7rdg @FelRoseOFP50 They looked good the whole game - ready for Boston! Go #Rays! @LanceMcAlister Ha, I read this wrong the first time - thought you were saying they had trillions of wins! @FelRoseOFP50 Preach! Just saw a sign on TV while they were talking about the A-Rod scandal that said "Bud Selig was asteroid lover" - need to work on spacing! Okay, #Rays, you are my last hope for baseball this season. http://t.co/3XTqUcSPgY Just received this notice for a deal from Amazon - 3 cents!?! Wow! #sarcasm http://t.co/6td5vMT5qM Baseball season over - should free up my evenings! Need a team to lose? Send me $20 and I will cheer for them! So it is pretty obvious that most of the world is cheering for the Pirates. (including the TBS broadcasters) Go #Reds!

Then I am going to get a Pumpkin Spice mortgage on my house. I want to be excited for the Wild Card playoff game on Tuesday, but the #Reds have not inspired me the last couple weeks of the season. Bohemian Rhapsody on the radio - I regret never having seen Queen in concert. @aj_colley @DailyJournalNet I also thought I was hearing more trains, but figured maybe I just wasn't paying attention before. @courtney5887 I always just seemed like random dice rolling and piece moving . . . Been years since I tried. Does anyone truly know how to play backgammon? @IndyMarisaK Yeah, but the first 2 stand alone, so you can stop if you want after those. Some editions have the first two combined into one. @IndyMarisaK If you like fantasy, it is good. Start with Magician: Apprentice. First two books stand alone, but there are 30 books in series Just finished reading Magician: Master by Raymond Feist - 5 out of 5 stars! Tonight I cheer for teams I don't usually cheer for - go Brewers and Bears! What a Sunday! Bengals on TV, Reds on TV, NASCAR on TV, Colts on TV . . . so many options! Bengals fans gotta love having Trent Richardson out of the AFC North! @crazynes417 This was an amazing trade. I thought it was a joke when I first saw it. Richardson to the #Colts = mind blown! That will be a HUGE game changer! Will there be #NASCAR footage on ESPN2 or just commercials? @IndyMarisaK Your house is pretty sweet! Thanks for sharing! I am jealous of your reading room.

Must be what they think they have to do to entertain now. @Klewism31 I hate to be the person who has the clean the stage up after Miley! And why is there a comedian yelling at me?

Will #Giants fans be forced to cheer for the #Reds in game 2?

King of the Nerds is ridiculous but very entertaining As a PC user, the Snipping Tool in Windows 7 was one of the greatest accessory additions ever! I took the Jeopardy test - it was not easy. The only way I will know if I passed is if they contact me. I would guess I got 30 out of 50. I am not sure why this makes me laugh so much - The 23 Drunkest Things On The Internet http://t.co/dUTUbygB @vendygirl That's true - not sure I actually gave them credit, though, as I predicted the winner wouldn't make sense. People's Choice Awards are rigged. No way the actors from Glee are the best comedic actors or should even be considered comedic. Wait, I don't get it - Brian Kelly is coaching in tonight's bowl game? I thought he would have switched teams by now. Ask if you can turn up the TV and then yell on your phone. Nice one random waiting room person. @Alan_Smitheeeee with Manning there now, that is who everyone in Indiana will be cheering for now. If you are in need of having a team lose a game, send me $20 and I will cheer for them - they will most definitely lose. I just signed up to take the Jeopardy test - trying to make all the useless information I know more useful! Les Miserables was great! @vendygirl Just saw Les Mis-While I can understand the criticisms you mentioned, I thought the movie was fantastic.

Simon is their long reliever, so that would need to be taken into account. @MisterRedlegs @robyontz What about Leake for a reliever? Arredondo maybe? Guess I am headed to Cincinnati tomorrow.

Evil sky - the storm approaches! http://t.co/FOyQQA0U I'd like to point out that currently the Indianapolis Colts only QB is Trevor Vittatoe. I am tired of Cincinnati sports teams choking in the postseason.  Bring on the baseball and let's win it all! With all the crazy stuff going on in football, I believe this could be the year for the Bengals! Yard work in March - there ought to be a law! @mserinkelly It was because it had more of a female voice than I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not my usual read.

RT @The_ChrisMyers: In the midst of all peyton manning had going on..he mailed a hand written note of sympathy to my home last week when ... Too bad about The Beach Waterpark.  I used to go there when I was a kid. @LisaACOTA Yeah - I cannot believe the things he says.  So stupid! @LisaACOTA I could not. I was literally disgusted.  I have no favorites this season at all!  It is not about men and women-they all stink! This weeks Survivor - dumbest episode ever. Due date - still nothing to report.  We are both at work today.

Due date tomorrow! Ha! Best one of these greeting cards that I have seen! http://t.co/1iCzDRXJ Yes, it is fantastic! @horrortrailer: I highly suggest everyone watch Dale and tucker vs evil. Seriously. Fast Five it's a decent film, but the action sequences and the plot are ridiculously unbelievable. @TonyRobertsMN That's a great book.  I was surprised by the ending. Finished UR by Stephen King. A decent novella about a pink Kindle from another dimension.3.5/5 stars http://t.co/X7rgyetj #Kindle Wind is too crazy in Indiana - I dreamt all last night about wind, too. Read Old Man and the Sea - great book, lives up to the label of classic - 4 out of 5 stars Have to share this - saw it the other day: "How many Nascar drivers does it take to blow up a jet dryer? Just Juan." @kelimepie not seeing Fielder and Pujols all the time.  Also, feeling pretty good about the newly updated pitching staff. #Reds @HenduBlog always a RT for a Reds fan!

No Leap Year baby for us It is all Phil Collins in Indiana: No Jacket Required! Finished reading The Shack - a decent motivational story.  3.5 out of 5 stars. On the way to work I was behind a van from the same company as the jet dryer in the #Daytona500.  I was careful not to JPM it! #NASCAR Notice that Edwards and @Keselowski didn't chat during the red flag? Now that may have caused a bigger @TrackFire! #Daytona500 #NASCAR @thebooksluts I had just introduced my wife to The Big Bang Theory when we saw it.  Because of that, the scene meant so much more to her. @thebooksluts That was definitely the best part for me! Uh oh, another dryer heading in to the fray.  Good luck! #Daytona500 #NASCAR @thebooksluts I think that is what got me too - I wanted more of the classic Muppets.  Less humans and the new guys. Will we be surprised when we are still getting @Keselowski tweets after this goes green? #Daytona500 #NASCAR And there was just a collective sigh of disappointment from #DaveBlaney and his fans #Daytona500 #NASCAR RT @KKinnett: Drivers being called back to their cars! #NASCAR @MoEgger1530 Can you download the Twitter app on the #NASCARbananaphone? @Keselowski Much better than the new one RT @thebooksluts: We've been watching the old Muppet movies, and they are HILARIOUS. @AmyMeyer10 I looked at Pinterest earlier today - not for me - but I am all about #NASCARfire Maybe it is good that Sadler is on pit road away from the other drivers, he was causing quite a bit of trouble earlier. #Daytona500 #NASCAR @keselowski Do you have a car charger for your phone? You can charge it up for post race coverage! RT @NASCARJetDryer: I asked @JPMontoya to follow me but this is ridiculous! #whaddayameanhedontunderstandenglishverywell?

Help me Oprah Winfrey". #RickyBobby #Daytona500 RT @awfulannouncing: So everyone had Dave Blaney winning after a jet fuel explosion, right? @redsfan1966 No kidding! @AmazingDossett It wasn't interesting enough for JPM.  Think Blaney will be sending him a thank you card? @KKinnett and because of all that, Dave Blaney is going to win this thing - LAME! Strangest Daytona 500 ever! #NASCAR So, that was basically every Daytona 500 storyline wrecking in lap 2 #NASCAR HA!

Day dedicated to the Daytona 500 -	now it it's going to be while I am at work tomorrow.  DANG! Why must every movie have a scene with someone vomiting? Recaulked bathroom sinks and scrubbed the tub in the baby's bathroom.  So ready for her that I am finding chores like these. Breakfast! For those who know what it is, I know you are jealous. http://t.co/ZPtWiauS Message me with your e-mail address if you are interested in fantasy auto racing on Yahoo. Finished Micro by Crichton and Preston.  A decent and quick read, but the convenient plot twists can lead to the occasional face-palm. Playing Super Mario 3 for nostalgia sake.

I'm at Texas Roadhouse (4335 Southport Crossings Way, at I-65, Indianapolis) http://t.co/S3jV3U7M Tucker and Dale vs Evil has to be the best horror comedy spoof of all time.

No Tebow themed commercials yet - I am shocked! #SB46 Is it baseball season yet? Go Reds!

Yup, it is in the 50s.  Where did winter go?  Not that I am too upset because winter in Indiana means high winds and freezing rain. Watched Swedish version of Dragon Tattoo.  Except for a few minor differences, it looks like Fincher just filmed exactly the same scenes. Newton looks terrible RT @UCBearcats: Andy Dalton &gt; Cam Newton #Bengals Soundtrack for the Pro Bowl = circus music WORD! RT @KKinnett: Tom Brady is on the tv?? Changing the channel...

Fann you	 Auto Correct! ;) @Danielle_Conner Yeah, we are trying to figure that one out now, but nothing online about it. Probably said something about the ref's Mom! @Danielle_Conner Seriously, they must have decided after the first half that they were going to call everything a foul. Tip off - IU/Penn State #Hoosiers http://t.co/EjVsNG2Z Very physical game, but they are calling some really bad fouls. #IU #Hoosiers Half time show with grade school jump-ropers was LITERALLY the most impressive thing I have seen.

I have only tried one at a time @damesongames as much as I do like NASCAR, I do not blame you and fully understand when people don't like it. @damesongames Ha - good call - I was just wondering based on your reaction to fantasy NASCAR @lisabraun @damesongames Sweet! Just let me know. You do it on Yahoo? @damesongames are there any sports that Dames on Games will discuss only begrudgingly or not at all? (i.e. Cricket, Jai-Lai, Curling, etc.) @damesongames @lisabraun I loves me some fantasy NASCAR! @Goatsncrows All kinds, it just seems like I never agree with the critics. Watched The Bicycle Thief-supposed to be one if the best movies of all time. It may have been ahead of it's time, but for me it was just ok. Goodbye 2011 -	hello nasty weather! RT @Bengals_News: NFL Playoff Picture: Cincinnati Bengals and the 3 Scariest Road Teams http://t.co/wWTfB0lJ @damesongames And, I will finally get to see a freakin' Bengals game here in Indy! @damesongames Texans were probably the best matchup for us.  I wouldn't mind facing Denver either. RT @damesongames: Am I crazy because I think we can beat the Texans next week? #Bengals I am so confused by all the playoff requirements in the AFC this season! Bengals clinch a spot, but I didn't even realize it at first. Bengals game not on in Indy.  They seem to think that we want to watch Tebow. RT @KKinnett: Sanchez is intercepted. Is this really news?? #Jets Go Miami!  #Bengals Nice goal line D, Colts! Go Bengals! @MinkieBoodle Break stuff! @EricAdams Nice! RT @EricAdams: And all the Mayan computers just exploded. Happy New Year! USPS Christmas card slaughter - FAIL! http://t.co/43Tfdq7J Shopping for groceries on NYE -	bad idea! Looking at baby names, and the cringe-worthy "Brittknee" is listed. RT @aj_colley: Words with Friends just told me 'jesus' is not an acceptable word. #blasphemy Played poker tonight - I was more comedy relief than gambler @DJ_MCLean Yeah - I get to ride in a real stock car up to 170mph! Whether you are a fan our not, that is pretty sweet! You really should #FF @listverse - hours of your life will be pleasantly lost here. Julia got me the NASCAR Racing Experience for Christmas! Shake and Bake - I wanna go fast! @aj_colley They have done that to me too. @aj_colley What did we do to you? Netflix fireplace http://t.co/KTpjw91t Finished Hideaway by Dean Koontz - excellent read - highly recommended! (Thrillingly horrifying and suspenseful) Slow day at work - nice! Mom coming for late Christmas dinner and gift exchanging tonight - also nice! So, what did everyone get for Christmas? @Goatsncrows Gag gift from a friend. Maybe that is how he sells so many albums - gag gifts. Watching Christmas Vacation! @Goatsncrows I know - I squealed when I opened it! I was seriously given this for Christmas. I am ready for next year's White Elephant gift exchange! http://t.co/7r4FwCaf This is the warmest and most pleasant weather I have ever seen on Christmas RT @tmbg: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from They Might Be Giants. We hope 2012 will bring us all more love, music and peace. @shwood Nice Starship Troopers reference Merry Christmas to all! #Bengals #WHODEY! @LisaACOTA Yeah, that was nuts! #JeromeSimpson crazy touchdown! My shed! Tim Taylor would be proud. http://t.co/Pkqeu773 Shot through the heart #WaysJonBonJoviDidntDie @aj_colley I know, here I am complaining about your station again. You have to admit, though, not enough time allotted for football. #CBS needs to realize that football always lasts longer than they schedule it for. #poorplanning #survivor #amazingrace @LisaACOTA Ha! :) It is a holiday favorite for my wife and I - and hilarious! @LisaACOTA This is about the 10th time I've watched it Watching Love Actually Family Christmas (@ Brown County Inn) [pic]: http://t.co/7CMrCoO8 Apple crisp http://t.co/dIxRjLyq I am making apple crisp - I rule!

I am not even sure which one you are seeing. Teaching @coltsgirl88 about Twitter with @AmIJason Camping for three very small people http://t.co/akNn3Brw Just finished The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest. It was good!  My first e-book experience was not as weird as I thought it would be. Fantastic weather for reading and walking today. I hate to stop, but work calls . . . Not interested in striking up a conversation at the urinal! Steve Guttenberg gets star on Walk of Fame?  I didn't know they gave those for obscurity. Why can't they prorate data plans? Went over on the last day of my billing cycle - is 12Mb worth $15? RT @KKinnett: Your 2011 Heisman Trophy Winner is: RG3!!!!

Trivia tonight at the Red Lion Grog House Japanese steakhouse and watched Thor for my birthday evening. Now, onward with another year! Birthday gift from Julia! Too bad it's November. http://t.co/zsTNu6h7 Also, Kaley Cuoco, Dick Clark, Jonathan Swift, Elisha Cuthbert and Inigo Montoya. Some people I share a birthday with: Winston Churchill, Mark Twain, Bo Jackson, Clay Aiken, Billy Idol, Ben Stiller Just got a birthday text from someone that I don't know.

RT @tmbg: TMBGs new LP "Album Raises New and Troubling Questions" is at iTunes waiting for you. DO IT! http://t.co/2G7yVgCu @Goatsncrows Some more - our a lot more - than others. @Goatsncrows Every company has rubbed someone wrong at some point in time. @Goatsncrows Verizon is good too, I think. I went with AT&T because it was easy at the time and I was able guilt them into free stuff. Snow in the forecast? Not like Yellowstone, though. I probably won't need the x-country skis. @Goatsncrows sounds like my experience with Alltel. I know some people have had bad luck, but I have been happy with AT&T so far. RT @Goatsncrows: I'm a reasonable, sweet girl with a laidback, easy attitude. But I AM MAD AS HELL! @Tmobile sucks! RT if you hate when  ... @thomascaudill Intellectual Hip Hop - thought you might enjoy. http://t.co/69AyeQOR @Goatsncrows at the same time? @LisaACOTA I think it synchs with Amazon, and the library only authorizes it for 14 days - then it un-syncs. @AmazingDossett Welcome back! @LisaACOTA Yes - says I can renew as long as no one else has it on hold (they have limited digital copies, it seems) @Goatsncrows Yes, full touch. Took some getting used to without the keyboard. @LisaACOTA Yup, in a matter of seconds I had The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest from my local library. (14 day checkout) @Goatsncrows I have an HTC Inspire from AT&T. They have a newer model now, but I have had good luck with this one. @Goatsncrows I finally have one that doesn't suck! @Goatsncrows yeah, as I know we have discussed before, I love my real books. But I wanted to give it a try. Just checked out a library book online and downloaded it to my phone - sweet! Might not be new for some, but this is a first for me. Jockamos pizza for lunch - still awesome reheated The Walking Dead was great - I did not see that coming at all. Can't wait until February! @kelimepie Perhaps if they are a supermodel desiring impregnation, they might like him as well. HA! RT @CoachJonesUC: Today starts Championship Week here at Cincinnati!

That would be the only satisfying result. #Patriots #Eagles @kelimepie I am not sure there are any. @DatDudeBP Indeed they did! #Bengals #WHODEY @LisaACOTA On the flip side, if you have someone in who has no business being in and they have a great game, it feels awesome #Bengals win! #WHODEY @LisaACOTA Not a bad idea - I hate when one of my bench warmers has a great weekend. Very frustrating! @LisaACOTA Tru dat! I now know how it ends. :( Sounds like the #Bengals got a lucky break. @LisaACOTA Same situation for me . . . Fitzpatrick smh #fantasybenchbetterthanmyroster @LisaACOTA Thank you for thinking of me with your spoiler alert! :) @LisaACOTA I don't know for sure, but don't worry about spoiling it - in following all the games I an seeing lots of spoilers. Behind live on DVR for the Colts game. Just discovered why Reggie Wayne is trending. @LisaACOTA No - believe it or not, where I am we are watching antenna TV. #oldskool RT @StewartHaasRcng: Stewart on the Big Screen while being honored at the Colts/Panthers game. http://t.co/cfgG7Ec2 #Colts and Cedric Benson trending. I wrote about both earlier in the same tweet, so that may be my fault. RT @kelimepie: That was a serious question. I really want to know where the defense went. #Bengals #Colts rushing TD from Donald Brown! Catching up! #Bengals Benson TD to tie the game. #Colts allowing Newton to run all over them. Wish I could see the #Bengals game too, #Colts pretty boring so far. RT @ericaoeltjenx3: battle of ohio #BENGALS
