That isn't the strike zone?!?! @DBenem Have a good night, David. 😀 @DBenem Does he usually lick his fingers and not wipe off before touching the ball about 50% of the time? I haven't seen many of his games. @DBenem Yep. Between slobbering on the ball and Cuzzi behind the plate, he was impressive. 😁 @Sir_Rachel Wonder what the Cubs Win-loss record is against Cuzzi.... @DBenem I could have pitched with that strike zone. @DBenem It's okay. He can't be behind the plate all the time. But c'mon, you can admit that was a bad strike zone. Who had Phil Cuzzi on their fantasy team? @jkunks I think some of those could have been in Illinois and still called a strike... Why isn't Cuzzi out there high-fiving the rest of the Cardinals?

Lackey doesn't always wipe off. @Sir_Rachel Lackey likes to lick hand and go straight to ball.... not every time, but some. Didn't think that was legal. @Sir_Rachel way to go Schwarber... 😀 @Sir_Rachel The ball called 3rd strike on Ross, Lester just pitched...and it was called a ball. Just wish Ump was consistently bad. @BobBraun1 Belleville....I believe that's near St. Louis. @Sir_Rachel @ReadBtwnLynes Few more calls for Cards... @Sir_Rachel @ReadBtwnLynes Finally....now we need a few more to even things out... Holy crap! Cuzzi called one for the Cubs! @BleacherNation what's the current rule on licking fingers and going straight to the ball w/o wiping it off first? Watch Lackey. @ReadBtwnLynes @Sir_Rachel Saw a game where all Cubs rookies had a strike zone which included the chalk line of opposite batter's box. @ReadBtwnLynes @Sir_Rachel Cuzzi is bad.

Feeling good and heart healthy. @Beester_02 @JP_Ashman @dmoonfire And then be there for them whenever they need you. They'll make mistakes just like we did... @Beester_02 @JP_Ashman @dmoonfire yep. You do the best you can to raise them right, to be independent and prepare them for life... @dmoonfire @JP_Ashman You gotta do what you gotta do....And when they outgrow some of those illnesses, other things pop up... @Mark__Lawrence But I'm guessing you've already considered this. RT @Mark__Lawrence: [A Public Service Announcement]  Prince of Thorns is £1.99 again on UK kindle!  http://t.co/oZm0vQWLPJ http://t.co/HMdn… @Mark__Lawrence Besides cultural tastes and likes and sense of humor etc. @Mark__Lawrence Not being critical of translation, but wonder if your personal style is somewhat lost in one translation vs the other. @Mark__Lawrence Your books are very quotable. Wonder how well they are translated into Spanish of Spain vs Brazilian Portuguese... @dmoonfire @JP_Ashman exactly @JP_Ashman Glad she's ok. So hard when the little ones get sick. Hope she's feeling better soon. Take care. @Mark__Lawrence English versions or translated? @Beester_02 Thanks. @JP_Ashman Little one keeping you up? @Mark__Lawrence Interesting points, Mark. Thanks for the discussion. @Beester_02 And yes, though they lost, they loved playing and want to play again. 😀 @Beester_02 They can't learn if I don't play the game right. @Beester_02 I want them to learn. Learn to win. Learn from losing. Already they were working out new strategies. @Beester_02 It took a bit, but I ended up conquering the entire world. Next game I'm sure will be much harder. They're quick learners. 😀 @Beester_02 yeah. By the time they decided to gang up on me, I had just over half the world conquered...and enough armies to hold them off. @Beester_02 So this wasn't a typical case? @Beester_02 I hope you have a chance to relax this evening. I finished a game of Risk with the kids. Watching AL Wild Card game right now. @Beester_02 are you working on it tonight or is that tomorrow's work? @Beester_02 Sounds like a stressful job... @Beester_02 Good luck getting it done tomorrow... @Saboviec @CiaraBallintyne Not too surprised... 😁 @Beester_02 I'm guessing it was better than yours. @CiaraBallintyne @Saboviec actual telling? Because if thinking it counts.....ummm...not sure if I've had a successful day in like...forever? @ReadBtwnLynes @Sir_Rachel I was in the new store too. Briefly. Can't wait until it's done! 😁 @dmoonfire Didn't Clark Kent wear glasses. Okay, maybe it was just his 'disguise'... but still. 😀 @JP_Ashman Did you get it on right? @Beester_02 did you make it through your day? @Saboviec @CiaraBallintyne By that definition....today was a success for me too! 😁 Hope you have similar success tomorrow. RT @CiaraBallintyne: #Book #Review of Empire Ascendent by Kameron Hurley http://t.co/TGhiLdqeHM @CiaraBallintyne I know, I know...but for my health I suppose I'll live with the shame. 😀 @Mark__Lawrence And I wonder if it's in part more language usage/ slang rather than actual author's home country. @Mark__Lawrence Not sure about the 99.9%.... I think it's high, just not that high. @Mark__Lawrence why do you think your sales are equal in UK vs US? Again, just curious. @Mark__Lawrence have even heard some readers prefer authors from certain countries (I don't understand that one). @Mark__Lawrence perhaps authors are more well known in home country, publicity greater in home country, book signings, author visits etc.. @G_R_Matthews yep. @G_R_Matthews Cool. I'm still following the SPFBO. @G_R_Matthews I'll try to keep an eye out for it. Or tweet me about it, if you think of it. Thanks. @G_R_Matthews thanks. I figured you might be busy with top 10. I was happy to be honorable mention for SPFBO. Met lots of great new authors. @G_R_Matthews @Mark__Lawrence I've had more US sales, with UK second, though Australia makes a good showing. @G_R_Matthews I'll review your book as soon as I finish it. I think it's the next e-book I'll read. RT @G_R_Matthews: @STWick @Mark__Lawrence According to my link click stats on Booklinker... I get more clicks in the USA, more reviews from… @CiaraBallintyne I know. It seems like I'm rowing daily again... @Mark__Lawrence Does modern tech really negate all that? Just curious about your thoughts. Thanks. @Mark__Lawrence do you think an author's home country affects sales in general, or just not for you specifically.... @Mark__Lawrence Do you think you'd sell more over here if you lived over here? She also gets treats for doing her business outside. What a life... 😀 My dog has a pretty good life. She sits in a chair and stares out the window and growls at people she doesn't like... In a race to 1,000,000 books sold, @Mark__Lawrence has admitted to being past 750,000. Friends, I need your help to catch up. Thank you! 😁 For $2.99 you can buy one of my books OR two donuts &amp; stress out about gaining weight. Don't stress out about gaining weight, read my books!

LOL @JP_Ashman @G_R_Matthews Guessing I will too. @JP_Ashman @G_R_Matthews @Beester_02 I don't think writers are normal. At least, I don't think I've ever met any... 😁 @G_R_Matthews congrats. And glad to hear...hoping to read The Stone Road once I'm done reading The Rush of Betrayal books. @G_R_Matthews @JP_Ashman @Beester_02 yeah...when did Normal happen over there? I'm still waiting for Normal here... @JP_Ashman @Beester_02 Happy to have read and reviewed it. It was quite good. 😀 @JP_Ashman @Beester_02 Saucy.... Friends!

NL central will be strong for many years, I think. Rough for Milwaukee and Cincinnati... @DBenem Cubs might make it a lot harder for the next few years. Good for them. Good for baseball. @DBenem yeah, no fan of all that BS either. Play hard, play clean, play with respect.... @DBenem I'm in favor of teams playing hard, but clean. Hopefully that is what we see. @DBenem when Molina slid late into Russell, after 2nd base, was that 'dirty' or just playing hard? Seemed like it settled down afterwards.. @DBenem Was that after Rizzo got hit twice? I figure teams will sort out what they think they have to do. @DBenem Good review @DBenem Actually, Cards-Pirates fighting it out this week probably helps Cubs too. Cubs can rest key players... @DBenem Probably don't want to end up tied at season end. Would require an extra game before WC 1 and done game. Good for Cubs maybe... @DBenem All 3 NL central teams heading to Playoffs are good. Great even. Should make for some great baseball... 😁 @DBenem Angrier?
