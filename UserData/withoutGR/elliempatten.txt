Love this article. https://t.co/mTybbod0os Somehow, I don't feel reassured @UplayUbisoft https://t.co/U1mbg9ABAm @NoRealRoots Haha ok I will do. I got a tomb raider mug for asking a question last year, I'm hoping to repeat my success 😏 @NoRealRoots Saturday and Sunday :) @NoRealRoots I could have guessed :P I haven't played Overwatch, so maybe I should. I'm hoping someone will direct me to some good indies 😏 @NoRealRoots Definitely Dishonored 2 and Horizon, maybe Hitman, Grimm: Dark Legacy, Endless Space, Lifeless and some other indies. Yours? Creating a list of games I want to play at #EGX2016 and wondering how many times it's acceptable to play the Horizon Zero Dawn demo 🤔 RT @feliciaday: This is so brilliant as xkcd always is: Earth Temperature Timeline https://t.co/HpFbglVTU9 RT @legogradstudent: Checking that the coast is clear, the grad student makes his third pass at the free cookies at the exhibition stall. h… RT @gobergmoser: Damn it, I've been caught out. https://t.co/9D73v3qXfu @megashton It might be time for them to think of a more general name @megashton I'm pretty sure they do Game of Thrones posts sometimes too - a jack of all trades apparently 🤔 @KimMedhurst Nice! I don't think I've done one before, but it was so cool! Elena's also saved me so many times, she's the best. Who exactly decided what looks "better"? I thought we were done with this kind of stuff? https://t.co/zEe29JqCni Cuties. #PS4share https://t.co/ACuOqhJY2J GUYS, LOOK AT THIS AWESOME THING I JUST FOUND OUT I CAN DO ON UNCHARTED 4  #PS4share  https://t.co/qph723RDGH https://t.co/ibmIOb4qyl There's a certain irony to knowing that as carbon dioxide levels rise, so does severe turbulence on airplanes https://t.co/X2VozKS2rf @ManuelaSimone @BBCAMERICA I'm a Next Gen fan, so I'm pretty happy. Although lack of charm is a bit unfair! He has his moments :P @zombie_heaven The total number of hours of various long-running TV series vs. the number of hours there have been of Critical Role :) @zombie_heaven Which part? Woahhhh.  https://t.co/NjevA5XYIP RT @GrokNation: Today's #feminism101 tackles how nerdy feminists reconcile their ideals when it comes to sexist comic book tropes. https://… Always a fan of niche science-based humour/complaints https://t.co/knKmkIzVSU Uhhhh so those Critical Role patches are definitely making their way onto my denim jacket. https://t.co/7j45UXZK4U I've only recently got into Star Trek, but I am so glad something so inspiring and meaningful (and also just great fun) exists #StarTrek50 "Supremely clever", you say? Oh ok then, I'll take it - even if I'm not "blessed with easy charm". https://t.co/FyeVgPKb7n Apparently I'm Picard, which I could kinda see coming, but I'm not totally sure how I feel about it. https://t.co/C0qN5j2ROA RT @JustPlainTweets: I am a very, very new Star Trek watcher, but it's a good set of series and I'm glad it exists. With links to anxiety, depression, and memory loss, the case against sugar is building fast: https://t.co/97oJH4htY8 https://t.co/3cb1SqBc9D Always enjoy new Shia LaBeouf updates. So unafraid of causing controversy or offence. https://t.co/AevDEMOjrF .@missmayim while the article was about the double standards for women, it makes a really important point about role models in sport .@missmayim There's often a "lad culture" surrounding sports. You really see it at university sports' nights &amp; post-olympics celebrations. .@missmayim makes some good points on the bad role models in sport and the double standards faced by sportswomen https://t.co/hjjjWZu2XA @tall_dave She has. And she's very practical. I haven't had the chance to finish it yet, I'm on chapter 18! Me me me me me me me! - Oh wait, I'm not actually there 😢 https://t.co/9FajaRmE5k RT @JenLucPiquant: Did you hear about the $2B Venus probe lost due to a math error? Yeah, about that… #urbanlegend https://t.co/eB38sAafil I am so happy with how they wrote Elena in Uncharted 4. She is an absolute boss and Nate would be lost without her (literally). Bookselling might not sound very high-stakes, but today I had to recommend a book to get a kid into reading. This is make-or-break stuff. Ughhhh https://t.co/u6YuoVkBHu "You have a first aid kit, right?" "Yeah, of course" "It has proper plasters, right?" "Errrr" 😳 https://t.co/MYvVocIqSp @zombie_heaven Sounds good! You'll have to give me a heads up on which games are worth trying before I get there too. @zombie_heaven Cool, I'm planning to take it easy too, play a couple of games, go to the careers fair and buy stuff I don't need :P @MasonCusack I know, I know. I like to think of myself as just another one of the little people ;) @zombie_heaven Sounds cool, might join you for that :) I know a few people going, so hopefully I'll have time to see everyone! :) @MasonCusack Haha ok sure. But I'm happy to queue with all the other fans. (I usually would as press anyway) Booked a Sunday ticket for EGX - it'll be a nice change to go to a convention as a guest and not press. I'm freeeee! https://t.co/TlQQzJ9FyP The kids from Stranger Things playing 'Stranger Strings' with Jimmy Fallon is hilarious: https://t.co/3kxSWN8nUv @MasonCusack Awesome. If only I knew I'd be in Birmingham I could have pre-planned to get a press pass *sigh* @zombie_heaven Yeah that would be cool! :) @Kenshh0 I mean, I'm not a very motherly person... But I can give the rest a go?! I think I'm gonna go on the Sunday :) @Kenshh0 Hahaha what does bringing you with me entail? 😶 @Kenshh0 Kenshow, are you just liking my tweet or suggesting you're going to be at EGX? 😏
