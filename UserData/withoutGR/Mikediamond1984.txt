Book Club: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams http://t.co/MDYXazZXKZ @BookRiot @Quarterly you're shipping soon right? @kelly_carlin for some reason my parents let me listen to all your dads CDs and he shaped my way of thinking so much! He was the best! @kelly_carlin sorry for forgetting the earth goddess. But I think she's the closest to dead!  Actually I the water gods aren't great either! @cenkuygur I'm a big fan, but why is it you talk so much about the "sky God?"  Are you more cool with a water god like Poseiden? @andysignore Two Towers is the best!  @dickfundy was right and his points were right! #stillagoodfightthough @andyerikson you're the reason my wife actually watched LCS with me all season.  Thank you!  Sorry you didn't win, but you were awesome! I think the issue with my previous tweet is that not enough people understand sandwich dynamics! If @JebBush wins the 2016 election can we call it the strangest club sandwich in history? #ineedhelp I need examples of references to Hemingway in modern literature.  #literature I spend way too much time double checking stupid shit that politicians and public figures say.  Wasting my own time. #gobacktonativia My takedown of blindly following tradition! http://t.co/e2QJPN94wQ @idriselba would be an amazing Bond.  He would be good at pretty much anything accept Doctor Who because he's too suave. @SirPatStew Greatest interview ever with @nerdist!  Absolutely amazing! @screenjunkies who is the most talented actor that people hate? #moviefights @halrudnick thanks a lot for the google-eyed gremlin!  #gremlins2 In Defense of 3rd Party and Fringe Candidates http://t.co/q25uiTslKO Sometimes I like to think that climate change is actually a Lex Luthor style plot to increase property values on the new coastline! Book Club/Review The Sound and The Fury http://t.co/K1jqQkj25t @Jon_Favreau just watched #chefmovie while prepping tomorrow's dinner with my wife. We both loved it! @namtien92 hey, I feel like I haven't talked to you in forever.  How're you doing? Check me out Immitating Stupid Emojis http://t.co/xfRvSBLB8a @ComicJeffLandry saw your show last night and loved it.  Greatly written jokes! @heytherejeffro by the time we paid the bill and everything I didn't see you. @heytherejeffro great show tonight! @Eat24 Why did the hipster get burned?  Because he ate his pizza before it was cool. @nerdist two podcasts in a row made me cry!  And then laughed wildly. Thanks.  #paulrudd #ianmackellan @LastWeekTonight Channing Tatum is one of few celebrities I'd be fine with my wife cheating but only if he keeps it tight #keepittighttatum #drivingwiththewindowsdown http://t.co/c94oZoP5Zv Driving in Massachusetts keeps me doing ass kegels!  #masssucks Posted a book review/book club video for the book Wonder!  Please check it out.  https://t.co/syMNL6B6rw @dickfundy I would totally watch your pitch for #lastactionhero2 @screenjunkies what's the best misquoted movie quote? #MovieFights @namtien92 sure!  It's amazing for mockery! Whenever my wife watches @HouseHuntersUSA I wanna do a riff track on the show.  The hunters tend to be such morons. @DisneyPixar #InsideOut and #Lava were amazing!  Thank you. @AziHeron thank you for following me too! @pizzahut made a video in response to #hotdogstuffedcrustpizza http://t.co/lLwPNsWXD8 Dinner and my favorite movie of all time Man On The Moon!  @JimCarrey I enjoy hours of tugging! http://t.co/XJbZgJGNZ9 @namtien92 can we start referring to autofelatio as 'the AT symbol?' @MountainDew if my wife is ovulating should I be drinking a cold refreshing Dew? #mythortruth @starwars check out my defense of The Phantom Menace as the best prequel! http://t.co/jBdkqgL6VT @OITNB you came back early!  #mademynight @RealMeatLoaf we need a #batoutofhellmusical! @Quarterly @BookRiot got my first box!  It is awesome! http://t.co/4ZuF3qc7OC @namtien92 I think horse-slut shaming is disgusting! @namtien92 yeah I suppose you're right. The idea of consent really hangs these people up.  Consent makes a huge difference! https://t.co/fSaT5TqKPZ Why the Phantom Menace is the best Prequel! #starwars http://t.co/jBdkqgL6VT I'm the designated driver and my wife's the designated diver!  #tequilashots @heytherejeffro @adamtodbrown @Unpops @brettrader Sweet!  I'm looking forward to it! @heytherejeffro @adamtodbrown when are you guys recording those albums you were talking about on @Unpops with @brettrader ? @larrywilmore awesome job letting Evan Young give his speech!  He looked so proud, and finally got to have his moment! @alexandani my wife loves your bracelets but last night I almost lost a nipple!  #braceletdanger What a bunch of thugs!  Don't they know violence solves nothing!  http://t.co/U6XKg9fHcp @rickygervais I think bull fighting would be cool if it was more fair. One man, one bull, hand to hoof combat. @JordanPeele I prefer to squint! @andysignore also a subtle accent would have seemed half committed. @andysignore i think people confuse stereotypical accents with silly but I know people who sound like Scarlet witch #moviefights #laterespon @andyerikson saw you @Unpops live on 5/5 and thanks to your valley girl joke I can finally remember the difference between lat and long Any chance Life's Too Short will stream on Netflix?  My wife and I binged on Derek and we and we need MORE! @JetBlue absolutely love your service and when you fly where I'm going I always choose you!  Even more space side to side would be awesome! @EAT24 my brother-in-law told my parents that my bachelor party was a total sausage fest.  Then explained that we BBQ'd pounds of meat. @mindykaling my wife and I NEED more Mindy Project, and to see Mindy and Danny as parents!  Tell me where to petition with Hulu!!! @Unpops last night's show was awesome! @mindykaling just took the Universal Studio tour and when they mentioned your sound stage my wife and I went nuts!!! I’m #TeamPhil. Find out who wins in the #lastmanonearth season finale SUN at 9:30/8:30c. http://t.co/pjfUQpybRx I love Community! #whoisglipglop #6seasonsandamovie I told my wife that seeing the live show was the most important event of our vacation! https://t.co/TxQCvwE2jA I'm the sauce fan, #shelikesitdry https://t.co/2szppu12ik @EAT24 how do you prefer your pasta? With a little sauce on top or all sauced up? #thereisarightanswer #settleanargumentbetweenmywifeandme @larrywilmore good job on calling out the double standard of rape on @nightlyshow 8 days til I fly to LA for the first time in almost 10 years.

All of them! @namtien92 you're a very angry young man.  Let Him heal you! Some day I hope to be a @TheDailyShow Correspondent, because that would be the most amazing resume filler ever!  #SeniorEyebrowCorrespondent @MountainDew I love #voltage #codered #gamefuel #pitchblack and #solarflare. I just missed #typhoon. @MountainDew can you rerelease Typhoon next Easter?  Or whenever? Just rerelease it please! @MountainDew going green for a throwback!  #addictedtodew http://t.co/adWCrAmKLQ @BeLikeDerek Christmas special time!  #dereksays @netflix @hgtv might ruin my marriage!  #mywifeisaddicted @namtien92 @Pilgrim945 http://t.co/klccHaZaG2 This is how @MountainDew #voltage makes me feel! http://t.co/ZIXsCFYkVY @screenjunkies #MovieFights I know I'm a couple weeks late for the Star Wars Vs.

She is #theperfectwoman “@EAT24: We need your help getting approval on our new logo. Whatchu think?” I think your new logo is a shower and not a grower! Just saw a manikin with hard nipples AND darkened aereolas!  #wtf "I know it's 100 thousand under my budget, and has everything I want, but the paint in that one room is the wrong color!" #HouseHunters Realized that I have The Metamorphosis and The Time Travelers Almanac sitting on my passenger seat! #doucheycarsecurity “@EAT24: I’m just too damn lazy for pistachios. #Confession” sometimes I feel like that myth about celery might be true with pistachios! “@TheOnion: In Focus: Masters In Writing Fails To Create Master Of Writing http://t.co/IxLqU5Dnxy” as a masters student this makes me sad.
