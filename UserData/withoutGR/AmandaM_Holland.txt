Prayers? #hellomornings #hmcmg Good morning! Sleepy start to the day. Who else is up? #hellomornings #HMCMG RT @christi_wargo: #hmcmg praying for the persecuted church, just as Paul says in Eph 3:13 do not be discouraged, my suffering brings glory‚Ä¶ @bawaa7911 Good morning!

If we feel far away, it doesn't matter to Jesus @kweber562 Happy Friday! Also: needing prayers for my youngest. He's sick for the second time in a month. Just a bad cold but he feels awful. #hellomornings #HMCMG Praising God for a second part-time job! This gives me a full work week as an RDH. #hellomornings #HMCMG #workingmom HUGE answer to prayer - I got a second RDH job! Two days a week at two offices. I couldn't be happier! #workingmom #hellomornings #HMCMG @NextLevelMama Thank you. That's one of the things I love about being a dental hygienist - most offices are closed on Fridays. #workingmom Waking up thankful because today is my Friday. I love my three day weekends! Ready for #hellomornings time first. #HMCMG #gloriousgrace Busy day ahead but I'm starting with #hellomornings and coffee. #hmcmg Who else is up this morning?

I thought about walking, but I may work out at home instead. #hellomornings #HMCMG Jesus brought us near to God, breaking down the dividing walls that separated us. We are reconciled through the cross. #hellomornings #HMCMG @AurieGood That stood out to me, too! I love it!

Thanks so much for praying. @christi_wargo Thank you! My friend said she was jumping off hospital furniture yesterday. :-) Please pray now for the allergy testing. @klysko Lol! My oldest wouldn't get out of bed until we got him - my youngest hit the ground running. It does make life more interesting. @Jadashelle Also, a portable DVD player is worth it's weight in gold. Best invention ever. @Jadashelle We tried to start early when ours were little, so they could sleep. Pack lots of toys, non-messy snacks, and extra clothes. @kweber562 Praying for you, Kim! Hugs. Hang in there. My temp job for the day was canceled, so I'm enjoying my coffee and taking my time with #hellomornings today. Who else is up? #HMCMG @Jadashelle He is so awesome! I love his openness and honesty. #HMCMG @klysko Just remember why you're doing it - that helps me. I know my day goes so much better if I get up early for time with God. #HMCMG Good morning!
