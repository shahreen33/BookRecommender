My apartment is a mess, but I have motivation for the blog. We'll see. I don't know how this is going to go but my dentist is staying #BB17 I'm totally ok if some links one of their videos in the comments of mine if it's related. Stupid youtube. I do not understand youtube's spam feature. It picks the most random comments and I always forget to go approve them. Also, I'm going to try to get back to comments today, because it's been like months and I'm a horrible person. I just edited a video I'm kind of afraid to post.

If I ignore it will they all go away? I want it to not rain for like two days. That's all I ask. Sometimes I just want to scream as loud as I can. Finally starting my first #readorama book. I've been busy...doing nothing. I know I live in the country but who is shooting at 10 PM?  You're waking the dogs up. 4 of 5 stars to Nowhere but Here by Renee Carlino https://t.co/yMlwhi8JYk Just went to the library for the first time in 6 months. I want everything. I don't have idols but if I did it would be Mr. Rogers. Random thought of the day. I get my car back in a couple hours. So happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just keep staring at the Infini cover @KBRitchie Why is it so pretty?! If I'm wearing socks I will eventually only be wearing one. Like a baby. 3 of 5 stars to What the Duke Desires by Sabrina Jeffries https://t.co/sjF22KeOKo Just started watching Don't trust the B in apartment 23. Loving it. I'm carless because it's getting inspected. I feel trapped. Even though I probably wouldn't go anywhere if I had my car. My youtube watch later playlist is finally under 400.

The cows just ran inside crazy fast and it's pouring. I think a thunderstorm is coming. I'm so excited!!! The Luke casting for the TMI show is my favorite so far. Plus diversity. Less than 3 hours until the weekend. RT @heirondales: i have finally come to the conclusion that Krista and Becca Ritchie and Colleen Hoover are the best NA authors out there Went for a beautiful walk and have my windows open. Let's see if this motivates me. 5 of 5 stars to Graceling by Kristin Cashore https://t.co/rF7RCJaOvV I have no motivation to do anything. Making dining reservations for my #Disney trip in October!!! My plant finally has a flower bud. So proud of myself. My co-workers are planning my non-existent wedding to another co-worker. I feel like I need to get a Canadian BF to stop this craziness. @Stacks_Of_Books I would say I'm sorry, but I'm glad I'm not the only one. They totally suck you in. Normally the dogs would have woken me up hours ago. Now I'm worried something happened to them. Just got an urge to watch The Secret Garden. But I'm away from my DVDs. Today I'm going crazy with updating my blog. Hopefully this works out. 3 of 5 stars to So Much Closer by Susane Colasanti https://t.co/sXHY5o1gx2 Just did my donation and I'm glad to help others have the same experience I had! @StLawrenceU #1856Minutes I'm #reading Addicted After All by Krista Ritchie http://t.co/AEqXbO1PfD 4 of 5 stars to The Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan https://t.co/ChRYMZMO6x If someone swears a lot it doesn't bother me but in books it gets annoying.

And I feel most people who don't experience this don't understand and ughüòì There may be a fire at work. Maybe we'll get out early. 3 of 5 stars to Highlander in Disguise by Julia London https://t.co/sPj85pChfu Anxiety isn't something you just get over. Seriously people stop saying that. RT @heissenstat: How special?  It produced Spartacus and Aragorn, 'Nuff said.  #L4LWeek @StLawrenceU http://t.co/u0Ks71SJ4K I was too busy to watch Arrow and now apparently there's all kinds of #olicity but I've missed too many episodes to start again. 4 of 5 stars to A Gallagher Wedding by Ally Carter https://t.co/uhllBMuxJZ So it it canon that #Castle and Esposito are 1 Direction fans? Getting caught up on #AgentsofSHIELD and I'm loving Fitz even more. Apparently it's a real outage with no restoration time. It's 5 am. The power went out which woke me up.

I'm still included in the friends list. Interesting... Planning to stay up until Maybe Not by @colleenhoover releases at midnight. Good thing I have tomorrow off. Trying to find references for a job without letting your current job know you're looking around is so hard. #adultproblems I read The Redhead Revealed by Alice Clayton https://t.co/K0VMzB837E Pitch Perfect 2 trailer apparently dropped today. I need to get home to watch!!! Why does twitter have to spoil Survivor for me?  Knew I should have stayed away. Just finished Daughter of Smoke and Bone.

Why do I keep reading? 4 of 5 stars to Make it Count by Megan Erickson https://t.co/ecc7Y9FqV5 And the slut-shaming is back. Yeah, that's not how college works. Still reading After: She's basically trying to date her dad (cliche much) and I'm pretty sure he has a mental condition-seriously. Reading After on wattpad. What the hell is this? So many people want to date a doctor or lawyer. I want to date a mechanic so they can take care of my car. Those are real skills. Emergency visit to a mechanic. I hate being an adult. That's what happens when girls stick together #survivor #TribalCouncil I'm so over Drew. Can we have John back? #survivor Why aren't there more good hockey movies? It feels like a good day for a Might Ducks marathon. Maybe not D3 because there's a shortage of Emilio. RIT plays Clarkson tomorrow. Thinking about coming back just to make fun of Clarkson like the old days. Waiting for the #sluhockey game at RIT to start! @StLawrenceU About to watch my first episode of Scandal. Equal parts afraid I'll love or hate it. Let's see. Have you noticed a lot of #Disney movies have quirky/sassy horses? My internet's been out for a whole day. This sucks. I just want Frankie gone #BB16 Is it weird that underage drinking in books makes me uncomfortable? There's a snake in my basement. This is why living in the country can be bad sometimes. Waiting for #IfIStay to start. Tissues are prepared #bbw doesn't have the sweater weather candle. So sad. That's why I came to the mall. Just finished #wallbanger by @alice_clayton. Probably the funniest book I've read all year. And made me want zucchini bread. Bad. Victoria. Unlikely voice of reason #BB16 So everyone's just playing Derrick's game. If it's like this again next week I might be done. #BB16 Do you think the house guests will regretting hating Donny since America loves him? #BB16 I do Whenever someone says "So good. So Good." I start singing Sweet Caroline. I blame #SLU. @StLawrenceU My pre-orders of Ugly Love by @colleenhoover and Opposition by @JLArmentrout have been delayed. Someone hates me. I'm being tortured. What are the chances Barnes and Noble would already have copies if Opposition or Ugly Love out?  It's a 20 minute drive. Guess I'm going to have to read Delirium next so I can watch this show. Trying to paint my nails while watching @xtineMAY's book talk on COHF was probably the biggest mistake I've made in months. Too many laughs! Just realized all my youtube messages/notifications were going to my spam folder. So sad. Why did I not know there was a new Colleen Hoover book coming out? I can now get out of the book hangover from Maybe Someday.
