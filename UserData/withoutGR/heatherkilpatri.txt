Let us remember: Many movements have been in the name of a religion or cause that had some violence, even Christianity. @iJesseWilliams #BLM Let us all be aware: Yes, of course there are violent extremists, but they DO NOT represent the movement on the whole. @iJesseWilliams #BLM Let me be clear as day: Black Lives Matter means that all blacks lives are equal to the value of another person's life. @iJesseWilliams #BLM @apar1969 @JeffErick1234 @iJesseWilliams All movements, religions, and countries have extremists that abuse movements with good intentions. @apar1969 @JeffErick1234 @iJesseWilliams Those are vigilantes who do not represent the BLM movement on the whole. @Stevefins86 @JeffErick1234 @iJesseWilliams No I do mean ALL Black Lives matter and don't preclude any black person from my statement. @TeamHudson11 @JeffErick1234 @iJesseWilliams Not everyone does believe what you're saying. Some people still don't see blacks as equal. #BLM @JeffErick1234 @iJesseWilliams Sometimes it turns to violence and that sucks.
