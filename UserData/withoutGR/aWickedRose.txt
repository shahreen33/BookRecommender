That's how we got Trump in the first place. In short, in order to still be worried about Hillary's emails and ignorant of Trump's dalliances you have to bury your head in the sand. 2. To be completely unaware of Trump's many sexual assault cases that he's settled or wiggled out of. 1. To completely overlook any other president or Sec of State losing emails or making a bad call that caused loss of life. So I see a lot of people saying that what Trump said is creepy but not as bad as what Hillary did. To make this statement you need 2 things: To share or not to share. That is the answer. Fuck this.

Why am I up like my kid won't be coming for me at the crack of dawn? @SheSeauxSaditty *raises hand pitifully* Hydration is important. Got to get rid of these frequent headaches. Doc showcases compassion and the world definitely needs more of that. #RenewDocMcStuffins Doc McStuffins is in danger of not being renewed? Dude they just did a big thing about them adopting a sister. They HAVE to keep it! I need a massage. @CruzanChoklate @VanDerek_ I tried to finish but no. nope. nah Eating ice cream and watching Magic Mike XXL. I could be doing other things...but nah. People are drunk already. Fun times are fun. Jersey Mikes doesn't open for another 30 minutes but I'm hungry now. #firstworldproblems #stayratchetTwitter @morphowings MN to visit his family. I'd have gone but...work. :( Taking hubby and kiddo to the airport. Dying a little inside. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassss bitch! @thatonequeen #DragRace #activistqueen #giftingqueen @thatonequeen is a winner for sure. I'm so serious about throwing shit if she doesn't win. #DragRace #TeamBob Shady from the cradle Bob. I love you. #DragRace And now Bob is gonna cry. And rightfully so. It's Carol Channing. #DragRace If Bob the Drag Queen doesn't win I might throw shit. #DragRace Robby Turner looks like someone I went to high school with. #notaread #morelikenostalgia everytime I see a handicap tagged vehicle w/ damage I wonder "are you good to drive? honestly?"

Have you SEEN @thatonequeen #BobisMagic #DragRace @morphowings Yes Those eyebrows on Derrick Berry....she just looked perpetually surprised. And not in a good way. #DragRace Can we have like a history component to the auditions? I'm so tired of these Queens not knowing basic pop culture or history. #dragrace "Not all those who wander are lost" - JRR Tolkien #SuperSoulSunday Birdman dipped into that white before he went to that interview man.

And tired. I'm so so very tired. RT @DiggsWayne: James Brown's gone.  MJ is gone.  Bowie and Prince in the same year.  My musical childhood is dead.  I'm really devastated. Diamonds and Pearls is the first Prince song that touched my soul. I was like "THAT is what love is supposed to be". Prince and my husband are the only good things I've ever gotten out of Minnesota. And sometimes my husband really irks my soul. @muzeness You shut your mouth!  Knock on wood, throw some salt over your shoulder! RT @StigAbell: Eric Clapton was asked about how it felt to be the world's best guitarist.  His response: "I don't know. Ask Prince".

Marriage is the most frustrating and simultaneously exhilarating thing I've ever done with my life. Godfuckingdamnit Acid Betty show some humility! $20 says you'd be loving Snatch Game if you won! #DragRace I am so in love with @ThorgyThor 's hair and out of drag look. Love love love. @JHatesSports *cackles* I need Carson to wear a wig and go Snatch Game as Nancy Grace. #DragRace No one is gonna do "Music" Madonna? Really? #DragRace It's not Betty aesthetic that turns people off. It's really not. Sharon Needles does ghouly and alternative but she's a sweetheart so. SO. See Bob did bitches a favor and played off of the other characters. #DragRace Derrick's shady grin was great. I live. #DragRace No one will ever top Pandora Boxx's Carol Channing. Ever. In Life.

I really do. #countryqueensdoitbig #DragRace I dunno how I feel about Kim Chi doing a fake character that isn't established. It's funny though. #DragRace Oh these girls came to PLAY. #DragRace Acid Betty's face is a little scary. #DragRace That contour is on point @ThorgyThor !! #DragRace Doing a male character for Snatch Game is always risky @ThorgyThor Biting my nails in anticipation! #DragRace Rupaul would be fine with seeing Brittney from Derek if he made her REALLY funny.

This is what you get when your toddler has a 10pm bedtime. Oh @thatonequeen Jinx won with Edie Beale. Obscure or not, Mama Ru loves her culture now. #DragRace Snatch Game Snatch Game it's time for fucking Snatch Game! #DragRace Zach Braff is really cute. Yes I'm watching Scrubs.

I kinda want to light Anika on fire. Like...really though. #Empire The fuck was Cookie wearing? #Empire I'm here for this Chasing Destiny show. I think a solid girl group could be fun these days. Or I just miss the 90s. The convo between Cookie and Jamal just now was very honest. #Empire @steenfox ...I don't know how I feel about this. Tom Hiddleston is a gorgeous man. I'd like to sit in his lap and drink beer while he plays the spoons. Eh. @thatonequeen isn't wrong. The feedback was kinda confusing. B-52s are cheesy as hell and they sounded very B-52. Jesus loves the kids and fresh groceries. I'm easily irritated today. But I have to interact with people. This won't end well. @thatonequeen Backhanded compliment is backhanded. @wtfrain @TackyJackie_ sounds super doable. I have horrible time management skills. And I don't know how to fix it. But it needs fixing. Fuck I feel stuck.

RT @CarsonKressley: And the #broncos!!!  Glad they won - they are like a horse.  And a horse is like a unicorn.  So basically the unicorns … RT @Cat_echisms: The man who has been "woo-ing" since the beginning of the game, I hate you. #SuperBowl #WooMan Whyyyyyyyyyyy are we kicking a 44 yd FG? Beautifully and masterfully done. Bruno is giving me old school life. I know he can perform it w/o Ronson but why? AH! Mark Ronson! We are diamonds taking shape! OMG they're doing classic Coldplay. So many memories in all of these songs. Pepsi is such garbage but I love Jonell Monae for that. How did Michael and Son get Mike Tyson for a commercial?!?! What is life right now?! CBS DOES have a good amount of fucking amazing programming. Hey @Panthers y'all need some of that glue from the Lil' Giants movie or nah? #TheImportantQuestions https://t.co/mXXF5jMlLX Gary Sinise is back on tv and that's cool BUT remember Criminal Minds with Forrest Whittaker?

OMFG Ryan Reynolds EVERYWHERE! https://t.co/3aCZPEXi42 @beauty_jackson They are NOT prepared for today. Like not even a little bit. I also need to find out if Chris Martin is still single. This is probably the closest I'm gonna get to Coldplay this year so I need it to be GOOD. RT @MaternallyDamnd: Please clarify how many Hyundais I have to purchase in order to get that many Ryan Reynolds? #sb50 @MattLiasse No. Cosby ended up being a lecherous asshole.

What WAS that Ryan Reynolds commercial for? https://t.co/CmP4Gv4f8R @thewayoftheid Tell him to walk right back out with that Fucking hell Ryan Reynolds is so damn hot.

RT @Mr__Harlem: The panthers bandwagon sitting waiting to dab like https://t.co/6ILBpghxXI What do we need with another Bourne movie? They didn't have to focus on Peyton's hairline like that. We know he's old. @CruzanChoklate @MorganDeBaun Dew and juice sounds like death. Don't care how you market it. @Hey_BlackGirl Patriots. Which is why I need Cam to get it together and reign these horses in. At least Gaga came out and served American realness. Slay Mother Monster SLAY! So Carolina wasn't prepared for how hungry these Broncos were gonna be for a SB win for Papa Peyton's last season. Idiots. I know all Canadians don't fit the dorky stereotype. But uhm...someone is responsible for this Caillou shit. And they should pay. Good for her. I'm thinking the Superbowl 50 halftime show is the closest I'm gonna get to Coldplay this year. So I guess Beyonce released something. @Mightashwell No one lived in fear of CPS back then. And folks would be creative as fuck to get a point across. @Mightashwell Oh my damn. She never did the taxes did she? @Mightashwell She's running around making drops so he can hoe out with the mistress??!?! @Mightashwell Now I'm intrigued. Curses! I have a blood orange mimosa. I wish the prosecco was rum. PrimeNOW is now in my neck of the woods. I'm about to save so much gas. Which I will spend on random shit. I don't want to hear about how telling that story changed Zola's life. That's not movie worthy. The actual shenanigans? THAT'S the movie. @aaronkfoley @thejournalista Pretty much. If they're telling the backstory honestly I don't want to see it. Tony Shaloub is in a tub with two Pomeranians. @ggchanel I feel like that's something I read somewhere. @ggchanel Don't most sex workers use a fake name? My kid is trying all of my patience. All. Of.

It's Ray Rice all over again. @NerdLifeThuggin Well she obviously wasn't shit. @NerdLifeThuggin This is why I follow you. I would love to see Anna Faris as Jessica. I think Megan Good would have made a great Zola BUT she's all saved now. @wtfrain Something! @BlackGirlNerds @thedailybeast The Oscars lack of diversity is certainly problematic but I would say the SAG Awards mean more. Angelina is OBSESSED with this new Floogals show. I need them to come out with a DVD like yesterday. Parkinson's is really rough. I'm glad Maurice is at peace now. #EWF @CocoaGoddess Also wondering if it's going to be about the actual saga or the fallout associated with her sharing it. Very curious. @CocoaGoddess Since it's based on the Rolling Stone article about the tweets I'm curious as to whether or not she's gonna profit. I want to read the Rolling Stone article. I think the movie is gonna end up being less about the actual saga and more her sharing it. @ashleyheff Silver lining @CocoaGoddess Variety ran a story. @wtfrain Like....what even? Fuck where's MY goddamned movie?! @Joe_Schmucc I wonder if she sold the rights to her story when she did the Rolling Stone article. @Joe_Schmucc Sure as shit hopes so. Although the title is misleading they're basing it on the Rolling Stone article about the tweets. @CocoaGoddess It gets worse. James Franco is directing a movie about the RS article about the Zola tweets. @wtfrain Do you see this shit? https://t.co/bRVyT3ei8O Is the chick who made up/lived the Zola saga getting a check though? That's the real question. @CruzanChoklate That makes a LOT of sense. You're so smart. @Joe_Schmucc You ain't lyin. The answers I have seen to this so far....I just...we lead different lives  https://t.co/DpXNbsCZXU @SimplyBerry Is this real life? @Smooth_Orator Ask a question.

For sure. @CajunPeachy The kind of responses you expect to get on Twitter are something like "I crapped myself in front of my inlaws" or something+ @danieltosh I Need Help @ladyw87 No. No I would not. This commercial about a super bowl party from Kmart is pretty nice. Still won't shop there but yeah. I hate my job. I mean like really really hate my job. Everything doesn't have to make sense. Sometimes you just gotta yell your head off and say fuck it. @kanyewest says what he feels when he feels it and I'm here for it. #GeminiNation I should be painting furniture. Instead I'm just sitting and resting. I hate the cold. My kid is still having the time of her life without me. Torn between pride and wounded jealousy @morphowings he stopped talking and just let me be grouchy Slept like shit. Wanted to call out. Might go early. Maybe I'm just surly because my baby is gone but I'm ready to slap the taste out of my husband's mouth. 30 Rock is still awesome. What the fucking fuck is going on with my dammed computer?

In September. #lieshetells @mamasnark no worries. Mom works in home health if you have questions @mamasnark They should list frequency. You'd want the director of the skilled care dept. Also you could call the PCP and ask what freq, @mamasnark Nevermind I scrolled the time line. Call the agency (not the nurse directly) and ask for the dr's order for your mom. @mamasnark are you dealing with a home health agency? I want some fries. I don't need them but I want them, @CocoaGoddess @dimpleshudson @rosebudstar I swore I answered this. 1.5 mins? Enough for it to be dry to the touch. Might also sleep in the armchair.

Won't post no more nudes. #catfish And as a milspouse I'll be the first to tell you internet bullies ain't nothin'. Typical they're sad lonely bitches w/ failing marriages. Why are people hooking up folks with their FAMILY when they haven't met these people? That's not a good sister. #catfish RT @Ladidahdi: "I love her...til I find out she's fat." - everybody on Catfish ever.

Too depressed to do anything else. I'm playing bingo today. Because there's a 40 y/o inside who wants to come out and play. @wtfrain She needs the D. @CocoaGoddess Aaaaaand now I have to make a store to the run. We have to watch #AgentsofSHEILD tomorrow. I hope they killed Ward. #sorrynotsorry All caught up on Grey's. The covers of classic 80s and 90s songs are killing my feelings. All weepy everything. Freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want to people. And THEIR freedom of speech means they can cuss you out. #fairnessbitch RT @buonasahra: Do people honestly think that freedom of speech means people can say whatever they want with no consequences? @KaeStarrz I am what I am. I need a secretary. Short skirt not optional. Then I remembered there's a whole stack of appt reminder cards in my fucking wallet in the fucking car. #damndamndamn I went through and put all of my social obligations and most of my softball games on my Google Calendar and felt awesome. @mamasnark That sounds like a bucket of no with a side of WTF. What is even going on with school right now. I just...I dunno. I need a better system. I'm going to bed. Before midnight. Because I'm a human being and I need rest and that's okay.

What the fuck man? @nay_nay84 @CruzanChoklate And I never said it wasn't bad ass to do what you do. It's more about clarity than anything. @nay_nay84 @CruzanChoklate Single would apply to ur relationship status if you want to b technical. I never said you didn't do it on ur own @nay_nay84 @CruzanChoklate Solo is just a more accurate term. @nay_nay84 @CruzanChoklate He is still involved. He can still have talks with the kids and provide guidance when they're older. @nay_nay84 @CruzanChoklate But he still sees them. Every other weekend. Which is actually pretty frequent when you think about it. @CruzanChoklate You are a SOLO parent, not a single parent. @CruzanChoklate And that's only if you're actually in a relationship. If you parent your child by yourself but you're involved with some1 @CruzanChoklate Not if the other parent still gets visitation. If the other parent does nothing but cut a check THEN you're a single parent Donuts for brekkie. Milk in a wine glass because I'm the only one who can run the dishwasher apparently.
