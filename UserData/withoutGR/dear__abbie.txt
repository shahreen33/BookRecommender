So even if just a few donate you're still up As @ArianaGrande just proved by escaping before she was cut free.

Anyone else on that page? She's just falling flat, to me? #HairsprayLive Ok, the stage cam during the commercials is pretty dang neat. #HairsprayLive @DarrenCriss as the backstage host person &gt; Mario Lopez (although really, is a backstage host necessary to this?).#HairsprayLive Is this live audience not mic-ed?

I love that Robby and his brothers all have the same haircut. @stampepk "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" AAAHHH. AAAAHHHHHH. I AM ALL ABOUT THIS! https://t.co/FdQD9v8MRM .@gailcarriger Sign me up!

I am 150% pro-@AnnaKendrick47 For Squirrel Girl. She would be SO GREAT which is exactly what Doreen Green deserves. I want a @DowntonAbbey spin-off about Lady Edith's magazine. Guess who was right? THIS LADY. They're both sticking around. #TheBachelorette She's gonna keep them both for an extra week, I bet. I don't think she'll send them both home. #TheBachelorette And Jordan got the second. Just James and Alex left. PICK JAMES. PICK JAMESSSS. PICK JAMESSSSSSSSSS. #TheBachelorette I am SHOCKED that Robby got the first rose of the ceremony. #TheBachelorette I enjoy that all of these guys except Alex are rocking a pompadour. #TheBachelorette I'm excited to see what the drama at the rose ceremony is about. Does she kick everyone out? Is this secretly the finale? #TheBachelorette THIS PROTRACTED 'DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA' SEQUENCE IS EVERYTHING I'VE WANTED IN THIS SHOW. #TheBachelorette So Derek said "I hope u find 4ever" but I thought he said "Goodbye 4ever" which = exactly what I'd say in that situation #TheBachelorette OOOH PLOT TWIST. Chase is staying, Derek's going home! I definitely didn't expect that. #TheBachelorette "I wish I'd told Ben how I felt when I started feeling it." -Jojo. Implied subtext "Cuz then I'd be w/ him &amp; not here rn. #TheBachelorette Also that shot of Derek sitting alone at the table with all of the food. I'd definitely be eating without them. #TheBachelorette Chase is stressin' himself out too much. He's getting defensive. I think I called it right. He's goin' home. #TheBachelorette @hulu_support It's working again! It was just buffering a lot. I think it was my Internet speed. :) Thanks for reaching out! Great service! Do you think the producers planned the light vs. dark motif in Derek and Chase's outfits? #TheBachelorette Derek says almost as many cheesy and terrible things as Daniel did. Almost. #TheBachelorette I'm jealous of all this tango dancing. It's SO FUN. I want to do that! #TheBachelorette "I think Chase has good reason to be unnerved because my connection w/ Jojo is really obvious." -Derek. Keep dreaming, kid. #TheBachelorette (I wish I'd had room for a giant DRAMAAAAA in that last tweet.) #TheBachelorette James threw Jordan under the bus for being entitled &amp; basically Jordan said in his talking head they're not friends anymore #TheBachelorette Jordan: *aggressively swishes wine glass* #TheBachelorette (Side note: I'm almost to my 2000th tweet! Prepare yourselves.) If I were 1 of these guys, I don't think I'd spend my 1-on-1 trashing other guys. I'd just try to show how great I am. #TheBachelorette And then @chrisbharrison could say, "For the first time in #TheBachelorette history, she's marrying FIVE OF THE CONTESTANTS!" I just want Jojo to ask, "How would you all feel about being brother-husbands?" #TheBachelorette This penalty kickoff is hilarious. Robby trying to payoff the goalie is maybe the best thing that's happened on this show. #TheBachelorette "These are my boyfriends! All of them!" -Jojo #TheBachelorette All of these guys on this group date are my favorites of the guys who remain. #TheBachelorette Earlier question answered - no date rose, you go home. #TheBachelorette I'd never want to be on this show. You basically have to break up with a bunch of guys every week. I hate confrontation. #TheBachelorette I also won't miss Wells. Just sayin'. Also I feel like I'd just ignore the date rose if I didn't want to give it out...lol. #TheBachelorette I don't really like either Chase or whoever that other guy is. I won't miss whatever one of them goes home on the 2-on-1. #TheBachelorette That mansion is gorgeous. Can I live there? Is it for sale and also deceptively inexpensive maybe? #TheBachelorette #TheBachelorette question: Do the guys HAVE to get a rose on 1-on-1 dates to stay? Or does it just guarantee they're safe at the ceremony? Omg that awkward high-five to weird cheek kiss. It hurt to watch. #TheBachelorette COME ON, WELLS. THERE IS NO PERFECT MOMENT. JUST DO ITTTTT. #TheBachelorette That glass bottomed pool thing looks super cool. I want to know more about what that is. #TheBachelorette (This is the most stilted #TheBachelorette live-tweet ever. I think my Internet is acting up - @hulu keeps cutting out on me.) Wells just seems so much younger than all the rest of the guys. I don't think he is, though? Anyone out there know? #TheBachelorette Ahaha everyone making Wells stress over having not kissed Jojo and her basically calling that out on his date card. #TheBachelorette I'm putting my money on Chase - Is that his name? The Jordan lookalike? - going home on the 2-on-1. #TheBachelorette TWIST: There's gonna be a second 2-on-1 date for the FIRST TIME EVERRRR. DRAMA. #TheBachelorette RT @SoFetchDailySFD: We're making So Fetch happen one post at a time. Check out the best of entertainment, lifestyle &amp; humor https://t.co/l… (But really, gorgeous.

I'll miss Evan's unabashed normal-ness. #TheBachelorette .@KittenMcKay He's gotten like zero screen time. He can't be sticking around much longer if he stays tonight. .@KittenMcKay No clue! I forgot he existed until this episode. I just learned his name about 20 minutes ago. Maybe Vinny instead of either Evan or Wells. Not sure. What do you think? We have so many commercials to discuss during! #TheBachelorette Wells, Evan and Grant are going home. That's my bet. #TheBachelorette .@Ginger_Clark RIGHT?! He and Jordan are basically doppelgangers, and for a while I thought Jordan was just EVERYWHERE all at once. I don't have DVR. Can someone rewind to fact-check whether Derek actually said "We all.."? I honestly wasn't paying attn. #TheBachelorette Evan and James T. have no enemies now that Chad is gone. They're both just purely likeable people. #TheBachelorette Evan - ever the voice of reason. #TheBachelorette (Robby also has his tight pants on.) #TheBachelorette https://t.co/CqbdCuqzAt Annndddd Robby wins the race to be the first one to say, "I love you." And Jojo says, "Aww, thanks!" #TheBachelorette At the end, does Jojo propose to someone? Or do two guys propose to her and she has to turn one down? #TheBachelorette @BrewCrewBlue No guarantees. &lt;3 I missed a bunch of context &amp; only heard "Robby is an Olympic swimmer &amp; that's something I think about a lot re: marriage." #TheBachelorette I'm significantly more attracted to that sandwich than I am to Robby. #truelife #TheBachelorette RT @enews: Freshman year vs. Senior year.  #TheBachelorette https://t.co/QjAcAuZaTQ OH WAIT THAT'S DEREK. Either way. Out of context quotes. #TheBachelorette They totally edited that sound bite from James F. out of context for the teasers. #TheBachelorette rt444tttttttttttedfc #TheBachelorette #TweetsFromMyCat Vinny has his tight pants on. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/59hBAaz4Sb I envy these guys their spa day. Also, did Jordan just eat his eye cucumber? I'm dying. #TheBachelorette Wells looks like one of those people who laughs/smiles at inappropriate moments. #TheBachelorette Oh my god, this poor woman. I'm seriously so upset/frustrated on her behalf. #TheBachelorette "I feel so happy. Nothing could change this." -Jojo PLOT TWIST. #TheBachelorette Obvs I haven't lived it, but idk if I'd let a gossip mag article w/ an angry ex as source sway me as much as these guys. #TheBachelorette When did Jojo have a chance to meet Jordan's ex? If not during filming, why did their relationship come up? #TheBachelorette Libel. It's libel when it's in print, Alex. Not slander. Get it right. #TheBachelorette I think I've asked this, but do you get paid to be a Bachelor/#TheBachelorette contestant? If not, how do all these ppl afford to go on?! (2/2) That way, the producers would have plenty of drama-filled footage to choose from when editing a plot together! #TheBachelorette If I were a contestant on one of these shows, I'd make sure to say I didn't trust someone in every talking head (1/2). #TheBachelorette Jordan's cat-that-ate-the-canary grin when they announce his 1-on-1. #TheBachelorette (also, glanced down &amp; thought he walked out in boxers) Is she going to get #zika? Is that what's making her sick to her stomach &amp; at least one of the guys question their future? #TheBachelorette Ugh, what a hideous tropical location. Must be terrible to have to stay there. #TheBachelorette .@andimJULIE https://t.co/RTq0nGpo0A I'm SO CURIOUS what this heavily-alluded-to drama is going to be! (Turns out I'm exactly the demographic for this show.) #TheBachelorette "I'd have a better chance of getting struck by lightning....while...........shaving...my...face......" -Daniel. #TheBachelorette "If this was based solely on looks, obviously I'd still be there. I know I'm a great catch." -Daniel #TheBachelorette Also #TeamAnyoneButDaniel #TheBachelorette YAAASSSSSSS #TeamEvan #TheBachelorette Rose ceremonies would be a lot more interesting if they were announced from most to least favorite like Top Model results. #TheBachelorette I hope she sends Daniel home. I don't know why she didn't right off the bat in the first episode. #TheBachelorette .@tanyacontois I like him! I think he's just too shy/not bold enough to compete. He needs to stop letting himself get overshadowed. Ohhh, Evan, noooooo, Evan. I have a feeling you're going home, buddy. You missed your shot! #TheBachelorette They're not wrong, Evan. You can't just sit back and wait when Jordan is making out with her on the other side of the wall. #TheBachelorette I thought he was just going to end that with "I'm falling for you...I mean, my heart beats." Full stop. #TheBachelorette I like that Daniel's occupation is "Canadian." I wish that was my occupation. Doesn't seem like much work. #TheBachelorette Who is this guy? Maybe I don't know all of these people. Also, is it just me, or is that not the first poem he's written? #TheBachelorette And that guy. Robby. I always forget that guy. #TheBachelorette Except Chase. I'm never going to remember Chase. I'm always gonna think he's Jordan. #TheBachelorette This crowd has winnowed out a lot. I know almost everyone's names now! #TheBachelorette OMG OMG OMG CHAD AS BACHELOR IN PARADISE THOSE POOR LADIES I'M SO EXCITED. #TheBachelorInParadise @Refinery29 The fireworks and chanting were my favorite parts of that! Like some weird, testosterone-fueled ritual. Ahahaha I love how happy they all are celebrating Alex. The literal fireworks are ridiculous. #TheBachelorette #SlayerOfTheDragon I was just going to say "Do you think Chad just isn't going to ever let go of vice grip on Jordan's hand?" #TheBachelorette "I hope Chad's not here for his protein powder, or we're all gonna be toast." -Evan, being astute as usual. #TheBachelorette Omg I love that they used a cheesy iMovie effect to make Chad walking through the forest look like sasquatch footage. #TheBachelorette "The drama continues on #TheBachelorette" is maybe the most pointless/redundant sentence ever because duh. I am SO READY for #TheBachelorette and to see how Chad's crazy serial-killer antics play out.

BYE CHAD. #TheBachelorette #TheBachelorette https://t.co/FaYQdbZ4m6 Jojo trying to rationalize Chad's aggressive and abusive behavior breaks my heart. #TheBachelorette Alex's lower-third should be "Owns American Flag Socks." #TheBachelorette This Chad + Alex + Jojo date has to be a device from the producers. It HAS TO BE. #TheBachelorette Is Jordan on both teams for this football game? I keep looking away and his jersey changes colors. #TheBachelorette "I spell win E-V-A-N." Cheesiest thing anyone has maybe ever said on this show. #TheBachelorette I like that they blur out the blood on James T.'s head bandage but on non-reality TV shows there's gratuitous fake blood. #TheBachelorette Do the producers feed these guys questions to ask each other? Or do these very specific topics just naturally come up? #TheBachelorette James T. ignoring medical advice to keep competing in this date/challenge thing is hilarious and also ridiculous. #TheBachelorette Ugh Vinnie just spoke in third person. That should be an instant disqualification. #TheBachelorette I wish one of these guys would be like "I don't know who this football guy is..." #TheBachelorette Also, slow dancing/making out in front of hundreds of people is the absolute last thing I'd want to do on a date. #TheBachelorette I don't know what band this is on Luke &amp; Jojo's date, but a kid in the crowd looks ESPECIALLY PUMPED to be on the bkgrd of #TheBachelorette "Were there things that haunted you when you came back from the Army?" Super sensitive question to ask a former soldier... #TheBachelorette Vinnie is the Justin Timberlake lookalike I'm pretty sure wasn't on the show until yesterday. #TheBachelorette Do you have to pass a health inspection to be on #TheBachelorette? Just seems like a hotbed for passing communicable diseases. I wish I had that hot tub. #TheBachelorette This resort in Pennsylvania looks GORGEOUS. I never would've thought that Pennsylvania even had resorts... #TheBachelorette Alright, finally have time to finish Week 3, Pt. 2 of #TheBachelorette. LET'S GO! Won a copy of @ladyjanies new book, got to hang out with my sis and got to watch most of the last two eps of #TheBachelorette. Good day! That moment TWO contestants from #TheBachelorette like a ton of your tweets. Thanks, @jamesjfuertes and @mrcbishop!! https://t.co/piKbOYhYQW SERIOUSLY!? SERIOUSLY!??! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!?!? HOW COULD YOU PICK CHAD OVER #PRINCALI?! #TheBachelorette Took me way longer than it should've to realized the terrible necklaces all the guys were wearing are their mics.... #TheBachelorette I'd like a #MakingAMurderer-style documentary investigating alleged conspiracy re: everyone making Chad look like a psycho #TheBachelorette That moment a contestant from #TheBachelorette likes a ton of your tweets. Thanks, @jamesjfuertes! https://t.co/TcxohiEeE8 I wish they'd update Chad's lower-third to "Dark Storm Cloud" and everyone else's with things other people say about them. #TheBachelorette This was my favorite part of this episode: https://t.co/XFBrhCEntS #TheBachelorette I feel like Daniel = double agent. Pretends to be Chad's friend but actually confronts him about things for the other guys. #TheBachelorette James and Jojo are SO ADORABLE. Just marry each other already! #TheBachelorette I'd never recommend taking life advice from Daniel, but he actually makes sense re: how Chad needs to be more level-headed. #TheBachelorette I like that James had to take off his suspenders for their swing dance lesson. #TheBachelorette Ok, I love this old-time-y themed date. I would do it just for the clothes. Also ballroom dance is SO FUN. #TheBachelorette Also, all of these guys have the same quilted leather jacket. #TheBachelorette I really dislike Chad, but his facial expressions are going to make some amazing reaction GIFs. #TheBachelorette Awww, Evan is so happy! It's adorable! I ship it. #TheBachelorette I appreciate that Evan butts into Chad's one-on-one time JUST LIKE CHAD barges in on everyone else's and Chad is a big baby #TheBachelorette Who is this Justin Timberlake look-alike guy who's interrogating Chad? #TheBachelorette "I feel like everyone is conspiring to make me look like a jerk BUT I'M A COOL GUY, GUYS." -Chad #TheBachelorette Jordan needs stronger hair gel. He's always got one strand that's flopping out of place. #TheBachelorette UGH EFFING CHAD MAN. What a scary creep. #TheBachelorette My stomach is literally in knots for Evan. Chad is a nut case. #TheBachelorette I hope Dan gets absolutely trashed again like he did in the first episode. #TheBachelorette This group date seems SO AWKWARD. And I'm so glad for that. #TheBachelorette ALIIIIIIIIIII. I'm glad he's finally getting some camera time. #PrinceAli #TheBachelorette A bunch of guys in t-shirts and jeans riding in a limo just seems incongruous. #TheBachelorette This private concert thing is super adorable. Also, I appreciate that Chase is just a normal person. #TheBachelorette It bothers me that Jojo has been in 3 different outfits so far on this one date, and they aren't even done w/ the yoga yet. #TheBachelorette "If Chad &amp; Daniel dont find love w/ Jojo after this, I feel like they might ride off into the sunset together" Evan gets it #TheBachelorette "How long have you two been intimate?" *crickets* #TheBachelorette CHASE. That's the guy I keep getting mixed up with Jordan. They look IDENTICAL. Perhaps long-lost twins? #TheBachelorette "Chad's leftover meat plates" is what I feel like Chad calls his exgirlfriends. #TheBachelorette But it looks like it's going to be SUPER DRAMA FILLED which I'm looking forward to. #TheBachelorette Finally watching this week's #TheBachelorette. I feel like tweeting it not-live isn't going to be as fun. :/ Faith's life takes a 180 when cute guy @ the bar has a paranormal secret &amp; her dreams literally come true in the worst possible way #PitMad Faith was an average girl - until the ppl she dreamed of started turning up dead and the cute guy at the bar wasn't all he seemed. #PitMad I just realized I would kind of love @JodieSweetin as Carol Danvers in the Captain Marvel movie. 1.

It's TOO much!! #TheBachelorette Do we have to hear Chad's snarky comments on all of the rose recipients? This is obnoxious. #TheBachelorette Chad: "GUYS I FOUND MORE LUNCH MEAT!" #TheBachelorette #PrinceAli trying to calm things down. #TheBachelorette FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT. #TheBachelorette RT @jenniferweiner: Manly manly-man Chad just dropped a MUSICAL THEATER reference. I'm perplexed! #TheBachelorette #HamforBach Chad: "I'm not here to make friends." Oh thank God, I was starting to think no one was gonna say it. #TheBachelorette And now we know Chad likes West Side Story. Can we consider that his one redeeming quality? #TheBachelorette "Every minute Chad is here takes away a minute from someone else." THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS SHOW, GUYS. Did you not know? #TheBachelorette It doesn't matter if Jojo doesn't pick Dan or Chad. They found each other. #bromance #TheBachelorette Are they TP-ing the set?! I want to do that! That sounds so fun! #TheBachelorette RT @jenniferweiner: "I don't know if he's here to find love, or if he's here for the free food." Hey, maybe he loves the free food! #TheBac… RT @nprmonkeysee: @jenniferweiner I can't tell you how much more respect I would have for Chad if this were a long con for free food. RT @jenniferweiner: You never, ever see anyone eating on this show. Not even on the dinner dates. Fun to see some old-school face-stuffing!… If the camera wasn't on him, Chad would totally eat that floor meat. #TheBachelorette Are they going to explain how this guy is making this snow happen? Is he magic? Is Elsa his mom? #TheBachelorette "It just seems odd that you'd be sneaky &amp; figure out a way to spend more time with her." Isn't that the point of this show? #TheBachelorette I guess I don't understand why they're so worked up just because Chad conned an extra 10 minutes alone with Jojo? #TheBachelorette Chad: Keeping camera guys on their toes since 2016. #TheBachelorette RT @Refinery29: I'm not Abs McGee, but I still got a rose! #TheBachelorette Chad: After this 10 minute convo, I have feelings - totally not the same ones I gave the other guys crap about earlier. #TheBachelorette That "coin dropping in water" sound was totally added in post. #TheBachelorette Chad re: why he hasn't dated recently: "My thought was someday I'm going to be on #TheBachelorette and I need to have a lot of money." Does Chad not know that thinking about things before you say them is a normal human trait? #TheBachelorette Awwww James. That speech thing was adorable. #TheBachelorette Do the guys have to put on jackets at the end of a date so Jojo has somewhere to potentially clip a rose? #TheBachelorette The moment when Chad actually makes sense. They really *don't* know anything about Jojo yet. #TheBachelorette Alex does seem like a nice guy. I'm pretending Chad's not on that list, And James seems nice, too. #TheBachelorette Live-tweeting #TheBachelorette makes me nostalgic for when I would write long emails with movie commentary for my friends in junior high. Jojo: "It's almost like everyone doesn't like Chad &amp; there's probably a good reason that I won't see for another 3 eps." #TheBachelorette I love that everyone is like "Yeah, Chad. Chad should go home. BYE CHAD." #TheBachelorette Chad: *HUGE DRAMATIC EYE ROLL* Another good lower-third title for him... #TheBachelorette These touchdown dances are maybe my favorite part of television ever. #TheBachelorette "Superdouche" would be a good lower-third title for Chad instead of Luxury Real Estate Agent. #TheBachelorette .@jenniferweiner That's what his lower-third shoudl say instead of "Luxury Real Estate Agent." I'm glad Derek got a rose. He seems like an actual normal human being. #TheBachelorette Jojo's eyelashes are distracting me. THEY ARE HUGE. #TheBachelorette @DanniRieckhoff Who was the one who almost cried because he didn't get picked then?! Why do they all have the same haircut?!? Also POOR JORDAN. Right? Was that Jordan who has no date and was sad? They honestly all look the same. #TheBachelorette "You've gone a full life without seeing Jojo! You can't wait 1 day?" Like you would "chill" if you didn't get picked, Chad. #TheBachelorette I'm seriously looking forward to watching this Dan/Chad bromance unfold. #TheBachelorette Also this Dan + Chad team-up is something I'm looking forward to. They're going to be bosom buddies, I can just tell. #TheBachelorette Chad: I'm actually the nice guys and the nice guys are really the jerks because girls don't like me and I need an excuse. #TheBachelorette Also, they are not making choices together. Derek is picking and Jojo is saying things half a second behind him. #TheBachelorette That "South" pilot looked so disappointed that he didn't get picked. Someone give that guy a rose! #TheBachelorette Can the producers make her keep ppl? No way is Chad getting kicked off already, right? But she can't POSSIBLY like him IRL. #TheBachelorette UGH JOJO NOOOOOO. #TeamNotWells #TheBachelorette They should turn down their mics when they're making out so we don't have to hear their gross spit noises. #TheBachelorette I am so opposed to Wells. He honestly bothers me almost as much as Chad. #TheBachelorette UGH NO JOJO. WELLS IS A WHINY BABY. HE DID NOT ALMOST DIE. HE GOT TIRED AND MAYBE OVERHEATED. #TheBachelorette Who is Derek? I feel like we've never seen this guy before. #TheBachelorette @ConsumerReports says 15 protein powders/drinks tested + for arsenic, cadmium &amp; lead. This could explain a lot re: Chad #TheBachelorette #TheBachelorette episode summary so far: Chad is a douche. Wells is a whiny baby. Grant is the best firefighter (who would've guessed?!). Jojo: He saved me! Remaining Guys: *halfhearted clapping* #TheBachelorette I hope Grant wins this challenge thing. Although I don't actually mind the other guy. #TheBachelorette OMG this song is adorable. Ahahaha. Bonus points for the left-behind-and-not-Chad guys. #TheBachelorette "Me almost dying..." Come on, Radio DJ Guy. You did not almost die. Gimme a break! #TheBachelorette Also, I don't get how this is a date? Do The Bachelor/Bachelorette dates usually involve feats of strength? #TheBachelorette I hope real firefighters appreciate seeing these guys attempting their jobs. Except Grant. Grant knows what he's doing. #TheBachelorette "Meathead to the max!" is my new motto. #TheBachelorette That is A LOT of protein powder. #TheBachelorette Chad was a car dealer. THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE SENSE! #TheBachelorette I like that all of these guys are just like "HAHA that limo is on fire!" and barely concerned that Jojo might be in it. #TheBachelorette \ I hope Tiny Marine and Douche Bag Chad fight. #TheBachelorette I've got salt water taffy and it's #TheBachelorette night.

Also verde chicken but that's in a non-beeping crock pot. @DanniRieckhoff @chrisbharrison Why didn't I know this?! We should simultaneously live-tweet next week!!! Well, that was a fun two hours! I may have to watch again next week... #TheBachelorette My crock pot started beeping and I missed Underwear Dan getting the final rose! #TheBachelorette How many roses vs. how many guys? How many weirdos is she going to be forced to keep? I don't know this math! #TheBachelorette THANK GOD. #PrinceAli #TheBachelorette Ugh. Robby is my least favorite. What a bitter, unpleasant man. #TheBachelorette If #PrinceAli doesn't get a rose, I AM DONE. #TheBachelorette Like 8 of these guys look like Jordan and I keep wondering why he looks so stressed if he already got a rose. #TheBachelorette "So, for a long time...the producers have been planning to pay me to come here and throw a wrench in things." #TheBachelorette @allysonkate BUT WHO IS JAKE?! I'm new here!! I don't know these people!!! @jenniferweiner Who is he?! I have no frame of reference for this!! RT @Millsy11374: Aaron Rodgers is like "Not the first impression rose!!!  It's a curse like the Madden cover you'll never be on LOSER!!!" #… Ok, who is that guy? Can someone fill me in? #TheBachelorette OOOH BONUS BACHELOR. Who will it be?! #TheBachelorette "Sorry, I'm contractually obligated to walk past everyone before I can hand out this rose." #TheBachelorette Does the "First Impression Rose" really give you any competitive advantage besides knowing your fate before everyone else? #TheBachelorette From now on, Ali = #PrinceAli because obviously. #TheBachelorette When do we get to meet The Bonus Bachelor? #TheBachelorette What I'm learning from the #TheBachelorette commercials is that game shows are back. RT @enews: That escalated quickly, eh? #TheBachelorette https://t.co/wECXnOlqcb They're drunk bro bffs. Also, why is Dan just standing 90% naked in the hallway? #TheBachelorette This drunk guy montage is my favorite thing. Aahahahaha. #TheBachelorette "Are you wearing a thong?" "No, this is male underwear!" This guyyyy. Ugh. It hurts to watch! #TheBachelorette "Erectile Dysfunction Specialist" BAHAHAHAHAHHAHA. I'm twelve. #TheBachelorette .@jenniferweiner That was so painful to watch! Foreshadowing: That teddy bear is actually a nanny cam. #TheBachelorette "I'm financially ready to take the next step." Read: "I make a lot of money. Please be impressed by my money." #TheBachelorette "Six is greater than one!" @flonase has your back if you never figured out the greater/less than symbols. #TheBachelorette Also, can we all take a sec to discuss how AMAZING the #BeautyAndTheBeast movie is going to be!? &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 #TheBachelorette Per my BFF who does not have Twitter: "I wish someone would give @chrisbharrison a rose. Just once." #TheBachelorette (Also, they totally all said "Kiss". No one is fooled, dude!) #TheBachelorette Cootie catcher!!! I remember doing a lot of those as a 12-year-old... #TheBachelorette I'm calling it now. She's gonna marry Jordan. #TheBachelorette Wait wait wait. Did that guy say something about Harry Potter? If so, he's my favorite so far. ##TheBachelorette "You better be able to do a push-up with a girl sitting on you!" What kind of weird standard is that?! #TheBachelorette .@tanyacontois I feel like I need flashcards or something. #TheBachelorette #TheBachelorette veterans: At what point is it finally easy to remember who is who? "And I swear...that I hate whoever brought all those guys." AHAHAHA. #TheBachelorette Did he bring a barbershop quartet?! That guy should win. #TheBachelorette "I wanna be your Man Crush Monday." Possibly the cheesiest line yet. #TheBachelorette "Hipster" is a profession now? I know a handful of people who would probably like to know that. #TheBachelorette I'm so glad she made a "blue balls" comment. That's all I wanted in this show. #TheBachelorette Santa should not lean that close to the fire. His beard doesn't look flame retardant. #TheBachelorette Seriously, though. They all wish they had a gimmick as strong as The Kilt. #TheBachelorette When on a dating competition show, ALWAYS MARRY SANTA. #liferules #TheBachelorette All of these guys are like, "I CAN'T COMPETE WITH A KILT. WHY DIDN'T I WEAR A KILT?!" #TheBachelorette James Taylor's song thing was super cute. #TheBachelorette UGH. That bit was SO CHEESY AND TERRIBLE. DON'T PICK HIM, Jojo!!! #TheBachelorette Also I keep wondering why she doesn't introduce herself back and then I remember they already know everything about her. #TheBachelorette Did he bring twist-top wine? #TheBachelorette Did these guys get like a dossier on Jojo beforehand or something? Or just making assumptions based on her Facebook? #TheBachelorette @jenniferweiner These are the burning questions we all need answers to! RT @jenniferweiner: I have more Evan questions. Did he bring testosterone to the house? Will he inject the guys who are nice to him? #TheBa… RT @jenniferweiner: So Evan is a...doctor? Don't you have to be a doctor to give men testosterone? Or is he like a back-alley butt implant… This teaser is making me so excited to see these guys all meet each other. Hi-jinks will ensue! Fun will be had by all! #TheBachelorette "Hi, I'm the Obligatory 'Country Boy' Contestant." #TheBachelorette I'm so glad @jenniferweiner is noting all of these guys' names because I have missed every single one. #TheBachelorette RT @jenniferweiner: Jordan says he's a "former NFL quarterback." @bsyken says he got cut from 3 teams in 1 year. Just keeping it real, Jord… The Bachelor Superfan guy rehearsing his reactions is THE FUNNIEST THING. #TheBachelorette RT @waytoodetailed: "I hope Jojo is the one that lights my fire," says this firefighter who now can never go back to the station ever again… Oh heyyyy, Aaron Rodgers' brother! #TheBachelorette This guy looks like an off-brand @Trevornoah. #TheBachelorette Can someone give me a quick rundown on who the bachelorette is? I have no frame of reference! #TheBachelorette RT @waytoodetailed: THAT'S what Reddi Whip got for integrated branding with #TheBachelorette? That cannot be what they had in mind. This girl seems super nice. I wish she wasn't acting like "Welp, didn't meet anyone on #TheBachelorette. Better go join a convent." @BrewCrewBlue That's why I took the TV antenna to the other room! I WANT THAT CAR. Can I have that car? That's a really cool car. #TheBachelorette Aannnd we're finally good to go! Did I miss anything? I don't really know what to expect!

Thanks for putting up with this! #PeterPanLive I don't believe any mom would be like, "Sure, kid. Go with this guy to a foreign land where I almost died a handful of times." #PeterpanLive Minnie Driver looks great as a blonde. #PeterPanLive "I'll never lock the window, Peter! I promise!" https://t.co/zHdohKfOYw #PeterPanLive "Can we adopt these 15 other kids who just appeared on our doorstep!" "Sure, why not. This is a normal thing that happens." #PeterPanLive "OH! My children just appeared through the window! I'm so relieved they're back that I won't even question this!" #PeterPanLive Okay, you would think if Mrs. Darling realized her kids were missing, she'd contact the authorities. Right? #PeterPanLive Do you think Christian Borle also played the crocodile? Because I kind of do. #PeterPanLive Captain Hook is officially evil for throwing Michael's teddy bear overboard. #PeterPanLive Someone should tell Wendy that she just killed her own father. Also that her father had a secret double life as a pirate. #PeterPanLive When did Tiger Lily's tribesmen get here?! This is madness! MADNESS!! #PeterPanLive Wait. Did the pirates kidnap Wendy because they all wanted a mother? She's like, 20 years younger than any of them. #PeterPanLive *Screams of agony* Hook: Hey pirate #4, go see what happened to the previous three pirates. You're a lamb. #PeterPanLive Hooks Last Will and Testament: Just tell everyone I was the best. Kthxbye. #PeterPanLive Oh my gosh. Breaking the fourth wall. The fact that this is TV makes this a bit embarrassing. #PeterPanLive It's an ages-old theater trick to say names of fruits and veggies while pretending to talk in the background of scenes. #PeterPanLive I wonder if the mics were on longer than they were supposed to be? I clearly heard one of the pirates just repeating the word "Banana." Why would you let the youngest kids stand in the back of the line? Geeze, guys. It's like you didn't plan at all! #PeterPanLive And then we learn that Peter's parents replaced him with another kid after he ran away. #PeterPanLive Does Mrs. Darling think her children have all been kidnapped or something? That's pretty inconsiderate of Wendy/Michael/John. #PeterPanLive Was the song after Tiger Lily rescues Peter formerly the very racist "Ugg A Wugg"? I have no frame of reference for this. #PeterPanLive Tiger Lily: Peter Pan, my sun and stars. #GameOfNeverland #PeterPanLive @ByZachHicks Nope, I DVR-ed it and am just now getting around to watching it. So I guess I should be saying #PeterPanUnLive That time Captain Hook announces he "spoiled his hose" after Peter scared him. #PeterPanLive Are Hook's lines of song traditionally just spoken? Or is that a special modification for this production? #realquestions #PeterPanLive That time Captain Hook played 20 questions with #PeterPan. #PeterPanLive I didn't know the actress who plays Wendy is a #Wisconsin native! I like her even more now. #PeterPanLive Finally, Wendy gets her own song. Even though it's about her being awkwardly in love with Peter. #PeterPanLive Poor Wendy. No one takes her seriously. The struggle is real. #PeterPanLive Those were some pretty conveniently located textbooks considering how surprised the Lost Boys were about having school. #PeterPanLive Is Christian Borle wearing a muscle suit? His arms do not look natural. #PeterPanLive Wendy's synopsis of the end of Hamlet = my new favorite thing. "Everyone died...but the rest of them lived happily ever after! #PeterPanLive Also, these kids have very high maternal expectations for this 13-year-old girl. #PeterPanLIve I think the song "Wendy" should be the new "Clean up, clean up, everybody do your share." #PeterPanLive Wendy: Hey Peter. I think I like you. Let's make out. Peter: Sorry. I see you as more of a mother figure... #PeterPanLive Tinkerbell is a murderous little fiend. What a jerk! #PeterPanLive I keep forgetting I can fast-forward through commercials. The miracle of DVR! #PeterPanLive Every so often, Christopher Walken has this look on his face like, "How did I get here? Why am I dancing?! What's going on?!" #PeterPanLive I never realized Hook was such a sensitive guy. He's got a lot of feelings. He just wants to be a fancy gentleman of leisure. #PeterPanLive Captain Hook can't seem to decide if he's British or German. #PeterPanLive I'm a big fan of Hook's frilly pink parasol. #PeterPanLive These are some pretty jolly pirates They seem to enjoy a good song and dance. #PeterPanLive Oh gosh. Christopher Walken's flirtatious dance moves. This is pretty marvelous. #PeterPanLive Wait. Is Smee also Christian Borle?! Bahahahaha. That's amazing. #PeterPanLive Captain Hook's beauty mark game is on point. Same with Smee's eyeliner. #PeterPanLive OH IT'S CHRISTOPHER WALKEN TIME!!! #PeterPanLive If I were Wendy, during the flying scene I'd be nervous that anyone looking out their window in London would see my underwear. #PeterPanLive Michael is my favorite. "Think happy thoughts." "CANDY!!!!" #priorities #PeterPanLive John and Michael sure do love to shout "FLYING!" a lot. #PeterPanLive "Sure, I'd be happy to be the mother figure for a bunch of boys my own age." -Wendy Darling #PeterPanLive Tinkerbell, harassing Peter's girlfriends since 1911. #PeterPanLive "We just met five minutes ago, but you sang me a song about how into yourself you are. Let's make out." #EagerWendy #PeterPanLive Alison Williams has a good voice, guys. I'm pretty pleased with that casting choice. #PeterPanLive "As you wish." Peter Pan channeling Westley from #ThePrincessBride. #PeterPanLive "Oh, a strange boy is in my bedroom? He's probably normal. We'll just hang out. Don't mind the dead maid in the closet." #PeterPanLive "Boy, why are you crying?" "I wasn't crying." He really wasn't, Wendy. Leave the kid alone. #PeterPanLive Oh come on. You can't cheat with a CGI Tinkerbell in a live production. #PeterPanLive Ugh. Mrs. Darling's dress is gorgeous. I wish clothes like that were still a common thing. #PeterPanLive And I love that #ChristianBorle is in all of @nbc's live productions. I still miss him on @NBCSmash. #PeterPanLive Wendy is clearly 20 years older than her brothers. But I'm glad they used a real dog for Nana. #PeterPanLIve I've never seen the stage version, so I have nothing to compare this to. #PeterPanLive They're lucky to have a whole TV set instead of a typical stage. As cheesy as this will probably be, at least it'll look great #peterpanlive I know I'm a bit late to this party, but I DVR-ed #PeterPanLive and will be live-tweeting as I watch it tonight.

I feel the many writings of @megcabot have adequately prepared me for this. Mrs. Bennett's outrageous hat returns!! I can die happy now. I didn't know they had pool tables in the early 19th century!! I think Jane just passed out on her dinner. I also think that Miss Bingley's friend is wearing a lampshade as a hat. Mrs. Bennett is the world's greatest schemer. She would probably make a fantastic con artist. I wish I was in this movie simply because of the hats. SO MANY GIANT FEATHERS. I'm sure they look great on everyone! Mary Bennett - being a party pooper since 1811. He say's your not handsome enough to tempt him? That's a deal breaker, ladies! #30RockmeetsPrideandPrejudice Bingley's sister is a first-class wench.

In the past few days, I've knitted about 1/3 of my very first scarf. #knittingisawesome Gettin' my Nerdfighter on! #brothers2point0 I'm pretty sure Gary Sinise would make an awesome cowboy. I've never experienced the joys of shark week before. New thing to add to my ever-growing bucket list? I think yes. Giant centipede hair beasts in my shower are NOT OKAY. #holycrapthatgavemeafreakingheartattack happy birthday #harrypotter! the swell season on jimmy kimmel after seeing the sorcerers apprentice? looovvvveeeee. @nerimon "Cheeky whiff" is probably the best phrase I've ever heard. Makeover shows = my guilty pleasure. Especially when they are also dating shows and the girl gets the guy. #PlainJane This week an abundance of unknown boys have added me on facebook: 2 of them are at college with me this year, the rest are 15 yr olds. Wtf? I have worked during literally every tornado watch we've had this year. Awesome. never mind. i lied. oops. the swell season on jimmy kimmel?!?! best ever!! #glenhansard #fangirl I'm pretty sure the 90's has almost every other generation beat for best mainstream music. Thoughts? Met a cute bike boy today. And got called for jury duty in August. My life is sooooo eventful. Hah. bought a cd of a band i never heard of because it had a pretty title. the music is wonderful. best impulse buy ever. #Wakey!Wakey! @mikelombardo big comfy couch rocked! i loved the dust bunnies that lived under the couch. definitely the best. i fail at twitter. Estne volumen in toga, an solum tibi libet me videre? (Latin for: Is there a scroll in your toga, or are you just happy to see me?) @Emryal they call them "crisps". :) Snow in May is not acceptable weather. :( http://twitpic.com/1m4de3 RT @hayleyghoover: The whole leggings-that-look-like-jeans thing would be a great idea if *anyone* were incapable of noticing that they  ... I love warm rain! One hour of sleep is definitely not enough hours of sleep. #exhausted Thanks to "The Blair Witch Project", I would be perfectly content to never set foot in a woods at night ever again. Im a pro at getting odd medical ailments. Current one: fish bone lodged in my throat. Faaaannnntastic. School, then walk-in clinic to make sure this weirdness in my throat isn't anthrax (just kidding...well, about the anthrax part, anyway). I really hope that volcano in Iceland doesn't cause another ice age. That would majorly interfere with my plan to become a mermaid one day. Watching the news. A under a monk's name it said "Expert on clerical celibacy." Well....duh. #CBSnews I got rear-ended today by a giant red truck on my way out of school. Thankfully my tiny little car is actually a tank in disguise. Hollow chocolate bunnies are not quite as satisfying. :/ Have you heard? The bird is the word! Pretty sure that there are more country songs about tractors and Jesus than there are rap songs about sex and drugs. All I need is proof... First flat tire in the school parking lot. Off to kwik trip for a refilling adventure! There is snow. On my car. Cool in december, just plain frigid in april. My car mysteriously smells like paint or permanant marker...? feels like a rockstar. Hung out with some awesome elementary school kids today and talked to them about #journalism. Sehr gut! managed to completely eff up her laptop. Yay for friends who know computer stuff. #technologyfail "I dont want bunny ears. I'm not a bunny. I'm a beaver...a beaver without a tail." 4-year-old cousins make me smile. :) wants to go ice skating suuuuuuper bad. is pretty sure Nickelback covering "Use Somebody" by Kings of Leon is the worst thing to happen to music ever. Nitwit, blubber, oddment, tweak. watched a bunch of movies today. couples retreat = mediocre. serious moonlight = seriously strange. time travelers wife = love personified. I used the self check-out at Pick 'N Save today. It was magical. my eye has officially been twitching for 24 hours. NOT COOL!!! wrote a pretty kick ass editorial for the upcoming issue of The Jet. :) http://twitdraw.com/habppj soooooo bored #twitdraw I'm freezing. Is it summer yet? poppysmic (pa'pee'smik): n. the sound produced by smacking one's lips. How do I loathe AP Lit homework? Let me count the ways... Just finished watching Ghost Cat. Turned out to be a kids movie, not a cheesy horror movie like I thought. Definitely still cheesy, though. i have zero idea why i'm doing this. laaaaaaaammmee. :/
