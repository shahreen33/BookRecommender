I am sad. Ray Harryhausen passed away today. Best memory: meeting Ray at ComicCon &amp; watching Ira have a fun extended conversation with him. Popcorn made.

I think I might go for 50 stories until going sedentary. 4:16pm... 14,030 steps, 6.13 miles, and 37 stories (oops). I think I am going to go for 16k! 3:38pm...at 13,046 steps, 5.7 miles, and 37 stories. I am going for 14k! 2:46pm... at 12,080 steps, 5.28 miles, and 35 stories.

If you seek a lusty gingerale, do not fly AirTran. You have been warned. Flying to Atlanta (the big peach?). Using Gogo for 1st time. Overpriced but my heart is set on cleaning out my inbox. Landing in 3.5 hours. Packing for trip to Atlanta tomorrow. Of course 405 south will be closed so I will go to LAX via PCH - which is pretty. In Simi Valley DQ with my banana split for the year. Next up, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Then more Sleeping Dogs I'm old school. I'll find aDairy Queen b/c they do it straight up. No frou-frou stuff like giving you a choice of ice cream or toppings. It is National Banana Split Day today (Kermit cheer!) It is every citizen's duty to do their part in supporting the banana split industry. I have officially become obsessed with Sleeping Dogs (sorry Drake!) and a lot of it it just so I can listen to the Softly radio station. Back in LA! Pondering evening of Rifftrax or Sleeping Dogs. It's great to be home. Met Jane Goodall last nght. The woman deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. Amazing person. What an inspiration. Did marathon viewing of L.A. Complex. First Canadians make more than us, and now they're out soapin' us in LA. Yet they remain so adorable.

Pondering what kind of snacks are appropriate for Curiosity's landing. A little over 6 hours. Woo-hoo. Can't wait. ComicCon, is this how you treat people who've supported you literally for decades? I am disappointed. This is crazy. My rant is done. Now, I am shut out. Why sell so few? I see way more than 10K at preview night at ComicCon - it's as packed as Saturday the busiest day.... ...the 4 day w/preview night was sold out. I could only get 4 individual day. I've got 4 day w/preview night for about 20 years no problem.. ComicCon you have greatly disappointed me after 20 years plus. I was #13491 when the pre-reg opened. When I got to buy (to be con't.)... In virtual line to purchase ComicCon 2013 tickets. Am in line #9741 -processing the line at 600 every 2 minutes. About 32 minutes more to go At SFO airport and am drinking what may be the world's worst chai latte. My faith in world civilization has gone down a few points. At LAX on way to Oakland CA. Will explore San Francisco a little this afternoon. Wow. I never saw that coming, especially the salute to the NHS. The Olympic Opening Ceremony was definitely different. The ribs were great. Plan for today: order ribs from Famous Dave's and watch the BBC coverage of the Opening Ceremonies. And maybe do some laundry &amp; kitchen work After visiting the USS Iowa we went to Dark Knight Rise. I had problems with the middle but the ending was wonderful We saw the Midway Aircraft Carrier before ComiCon. Today we are seeing the USS Iowa in San Pedro, then dinner and a play. Live theater rocks Goodbye #comiccon 2012. The anticipation of comiccon 2013 now begins... I am a very  tired puppy and there's still 90 minutes left of #comiccon. I am not holding up my end of the geek bargain Aquabats Supershow panel!!!! Brought only  4 pieces of chocolate with me today. Is it 2 early  2 eat 1? I just survived a 2 hr line. But the day  will be long..decisions Accidentally found myself at Power Rangers panel. Made a pledge not to watch Power Rangers. Tarzan panel was outstanding. I have made a pledge to reread both Tarzan and John Carter series Got into the 100 year anniversary of Tarzan &amp; John Carter panel. Things are looking up. Drat! Line too long. Thwarted 1st panel. Hope not a bad sign. Also, already lost Ira. Doing Battlestar Galactica panel 1st this morning, then Stan Lee. At least I am going to try! #comiccon Revolution was best one so far but it reminds me too much of FlashForward. Next is Cult and it looks like it will be unpleasant as Follower Follower - incredibly unpleasant show about a pretentious serial killer. Next Revolution. Arrow highpoint - some nice parkeur. Ollie's parents are both nutjobs and I think Ollie himself is a serial killer. Next is Following. 666 Park Avenue highlights - Beethoven's 7th and guy getting sucked into the wall #comiccon. Next up Arrow 666 Park Avenue is first Just finished annual Comic Con Mongolian BBQ ritual. Returning to Convention Center to watch five TV pilots. #comiccon Will be in Denver this week. Plane lands at noonish local time. Not on plane yet but already exhausted. O march of time, you can be annoying Birthday activities begin! First, tea &amp; cupcake - then drive to Arizona! Tomorrow - take the day to read a book and maybe see Battleship. The best thing about removing a wisdom tooth? Chocolate pudding! The worst? A headache. :( Happy Saturday all! I got into the Senior Management Readiness Program at work. It's a year long &amp; I'll do leadership courses, details, &amp; keep managing my group Yes pathetic, but very entertaining...the highlight of my week is now 6pm-9pm Sundays - Mad Men, The Killing, and Game of Thrones. Leaving Jacksonville FL tomorrow. Hope to avoid storm. Nearing the end of 1st week in Jacksonville FL (aka Jax to those in the know), and I have already given up on finding an adequate chai latte In 14 minutes an incredible trifecta: 2 hrs The Killing, 1 hr Mad Men, & 1 hr Game of Thrones. All new eps! Can it get any better? Not often 2 hours into Uncharted 2 - doesn't appear to be as fun as Uncharted 1 Drake's Fortune. I hope this game livens up or else not so fun weekend Just finished Uncharted Drake's Fortune. Found 25 out of 60 treaures. Ending was traumatizing. I do not want to go back to find more treaure James Cameron reaches an all time low &amp; Mad Men might reach an all time high. Now I know how extremophiles feel. @MadMen @JimCameron At Part 15 of Uncharted Drake's Fortune &amp; the game's become sadly predictable. Luckily Mad Men in a little over two hours. Can you dig it? Finally found Elena! Those coconut chocolae chip cookies did their job. But who the heck is Eddy? I need more coconut chocolate cookies!!!!! 4 hrs later Drake's still running around an island getting shot at &amp; looking for Elena. Time to break out the coconut chocolate chip cookies Told Ira if he got only A's he'd get a PS3. He did it so we're in a Drakeathon. 1st time bribery has ever worked on him! it's a game changer Tea has been put on, the brownies are ready, and the weekend laundry is in the wash cycle! The Drake-athon at Casa Taborn is about to begin. Will begin my first Uncharted Drake's Fortune weekend in less than 2 hours. This has been an intense month so far. I need some serious R&amp;R. Looking to hunt and gather me some corned beef and cabbage when that sun sets! Went out of the room to get some strawberry crush & when I returned I discovered I had missed the muppets. The  #oscars is a harsh mistress Best thing is the band. I want to adopt them. #oscars @MythPhD The other movies I saw were very labored in parts, but Midnight flowed thru out & I was expecting Midnight to be the most labored! And the winner is.. definitely Midnight in Paris - it was delightful, witty, clever, and very canny. Did I mention it's hilarious in parts? The Artist was quite fun. Main actor very charismatic. And happy ending is a plus with this bunch of films. Now on to Woody Allen land. Still traumatized by the dinner. It was truly bad. Waiting for The Artist. Ending with Woody Allen is starting to look better and better Extremely Loud was intense but very slow. The Help, sadly, stays in the lead. On my 1 hour dinner break where I am having some amazingly bad terayaki. And this is comling from a food insensitive person Next is Extremely Loud. So far Hugo as fan fiction vs Help's racism as character flaw -- Help wins Got my popcorn! The help starts in two minutes. Hugo was all about the Georges. About to start 12 hr movie marathon. Hugo is first. I was advised to do popcorn during the 2nd movie. Ira's birthday today. Making a cake now. Later we will watch a 5 movie marathon of Oscar nominated films 11am-11pm. What a way to celebrate! It's February! The Godzillathon will resume. We'll be entering the Kid Zone so we might not burn through the movies as we did in January. At Xena Con watching fantasy series ender by Katherine Fugate Godzilla marathon continues tonight with Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. Have to work tomorrow so no Astro-Monster second feature. Sigh. Took a Godzilla break and went to Universal Studios. Went on the Jurassic Park ride. No Godzilla, but dinosaurs are still cool.  Happy 2012! Next up is King King vs. Godzilla. After that is Mothra vs. Godzilla. But before we visit with King Kong, we must have some hot cocoa. Godzilla marathon has began at Casa Taborn. Gojira down & Godzilla Raids Again next. This is turning out to be the best new year's eve ever. Last quarter of 2011 resolution: Do the New 52. Know what I am talking about? Give yourself 1000 bonus points. Know not? You are very lucky. I am now a certified DiSC trainer. I hope to use this power for good and not for evil. Information I wish I couould send now to myself in the past: Never do asian food at the Austin airport. Will be leaving for Austin, TX tomorrow. I willl start my new adventure as a personality test intrepretator (or however it is spelled). 1st free t-shirt of con: Game of Thrones. Now I feel obliged to watch the show. Curse you product placement! I have been Shatnerized Actually got into Ballroom 20. I am in shock. 2.5 hours to the beginning of the family trek to Comic Con! I guess I had better start packing. Comic Con trek begins in 40 hours! At Ben Gurion Airport waiting on plane. Free wi-fi blocks Daily Show but not Colbert. What's up with that? Looking forward to 15+ hr flight Last day of pilgrimage. Tomorrow the Tel Aviv adventure starts. Pilgrimage is like bootcamp, but in a good way. I am sending this from the PRC (Pilgrim Reception Center). Woo-hoo! For 30 years I've dreamt of walking all 18 terraces & circumabulating the Shrine of the Bab/Abdu'l-Baha & I did it all my 1st day in Haifa Day two of Pilgrimage over and still have seven more days. I have seen and done so much I cannot imagine what more is to come. El Al lost one of my bags, but they found it in New York! Should get the bag Monday morning, I hope. Anyways, off to 1st Israeli breakfast I got The Healthy Mind on the The Are You a Psychopath? Test at OkCupid. http://t.co/yEo6ruR via @OkCupid I am now living in a world with no more new Smallvilles. A ten year addiction is hard to kick. Watching last eight minutes again & again.... Got back from Atlas Shrugged. They SciFi'd it up by making it 5 years in the future, but it still gave me massive flash back to junior high. My dilemma...stay up 45 more minutes and then stay up a further 60 minutes to watch Jonathan Kent beat the heck out of Clark OR read a book. Woo hoo! The California Science Center will get the Space Shuttle Endeavor. Ira and I were hoping for Discovery, but Endeavor's just as good Just discovered comixology.com. It's what I've been looking for. Heck, had I been younger, I may have created it myself. I'm in comic heaven Having a Smallville marathon - just got thru Season 2 & spotted some season 3 episodes. Later today, my first Puppy Bowl. 2011 is ok so far. About to start Doctor Whopalooza - proms, confidentials, then the actual show. If I don't make it out alive, it's ok, it's a good way to go. Last night I played Battlestar Galactica board game for 6 hours; was sleeper cyclon; found out I'm not a good cyclon; colonists got to earth Rootbeer, pizza, and a Monkey Island marathon!! Smallville - I am both saddened and relieved that this is its final season. And the best news yet - Chloe is finally joining the comic book. Leaving for Texas in 7 hours - haven't even started packing. Will be there for two weeks; then Tampa week; then back to Texas, but with Ira Took two hours to go 18 miles tonight. But it's okay, because Ira and I are going to play It Came from the Desert, an old PC game from 1989! I will be working in the Dallas/Ft Worth area over the next two months. I think it's only Houston that gets the hurricanes, right? Back from August travels. Goal was to read Voyager book. Didn't even get to Uranus. Have 4 more days to get the the bow shock - wish me luck Anaheim for a wk starting @ 5:15am w/Ira in tow. Doing job stuff during the day while Ira explores the wonders of Orange County. Will be fun Had a great weekend with relatives from Michigan. Made me ponder what it'd be like if I had more guests. Become social & all. Just a thought Got back from Kentucky Friday; going to the Hollywood Bowl tonight; going to Anaheim on Monday. The August of Constant Travel is almost over Will be in Florence KY this week for dayjob stuff. Still reading "Voyager" by Pyne. On pg 102.

Wonder if he mentions Vger? Survived ComicCon. Need sleep. Now. Comic Con bound in an hour or so! I have successfully lived through an entire cycle of the Ring of the Nibelungen. What's next? Perhaps tackling Proust, even if it is scary Anyone in the west San Fernando Valley area interested in being my Bollywood buddy? I want to see Raavan, preferably not alone. Anyone game? Just got back from Die Walkure. First act was too minimalist for my tastes, but the third act made up for it. Only two more to go - yowzah!! Just saw Das Rheingold & I feel too teutonic for my own good. Was afraid I'd hate the production, but it worked for me. Loge stole the show. RT @StephenAtHome: in honor of oil-soaked birds, 'tweets' are now 'gurgles. http://bit.ly/cIhZNf I just found out that I will be going on Pilgrimage in 2011. Does anyone have any suggestions when is a good time to go to Israel? I just ran 1.93 miles in 10 minutes. Well, 1.93 WiiFit miles in 10 WiiFit minutes.  Those numbers do not give me confidence in its accuracy. 2 weeks into WiiFitland & I've done my 1st lap around the island in 9.5 min. One weird thing - my lead runner tripped someone running! Huh? Birthday weekend con't. Today's agenda: hike in Las Virgenes Open Space, lunch at whatever is open, helping a pal back up cpu, & more cake. Birthday weekend con't. Ira got me a Wii Fit; heartened that my Wii Fit age is 38--what a great present! Have cake, will begin Lost marathon I forgot to mention, on the way to Starbuck's I'll listen to the new CD I just got, "Day & Age" by The Killers (2 yrs old, but catching up) Birthday weekend continues. Usually I go to starbucks only when traveling, but I am going this morning! I am indeed master of the universe. Birthday weekend continues. Just expanded it to birthday MONTH by buying tickets to the LA Opera's performance of The Ring. Am I crazy? YES! Birthday weekend festivities start now -- should I start the Lost marathon or Damages marathon? Or just cut straight to the cake? Decisions! I got all excited about watching Smallville this weekend when cold reality hit - I had already watched its season ender. I was disappointed. Woo hoo! The weekend has begun! Tonight is pizza and MST3K night and tomorrow morning is Smallville, Sea Patrol, and a lot of mindumbing tv! Took my mother to the Craig Ferguson show today. We made it on camera a couple of times (mostly mom). Ira was there too. Check it out tonite Back from my first visit to Tampa, will return in late September. Looks like I have at least four weeks where I won't have to fly somewhere. Flying to Tampa, pick up at 5am. Luckily, I rested up from Florence KY *just* last week. I'm actually looking forward to a week of meetings. Just flew back from kentucky and boy, are my arms tired. Packing for Kentucky trip. Tried something different for this trip - did laundry the night before! Now pondering various breakfast choices.. Busy fortnight ahead. In Kentucky wk of 19th & Florida wk of 26th. Since for work will not be taking personal laptop (hate to travel with 2) I forgot whether I mentioned this already, but Ira got a job with census! His training starts the week of April 26th. A great first real job I have girded my loins and popped the corn. I am going to watch Meteor Apocalypse and SURVIVE (I hope) Mystery Science Theater 3000 night was so successful last night that I like totally forgot about Smallville. Making cocoa before watching. Finally wrest free of the New Yorker but they offered me a deal I couldn't refuse. Will I be strong enough to be New Yorker free in two yrs? Looks like the rabbits at Casa Taborn had a party last night. I saw more rabbit pellets than any human should see when I got the paper today I took a week off to have a cold but the cold does not seem to have gotten the message. Why can't we have exorcism for colds? Cold...begone! I watched all of the Philanthropist but fell asleep 20 minutes before the end of the last episode. Stumped as to how this show got to air... Came home totally exhausted and wasted from work; felt like assuming a fetal position; then remembered new Smallville tonight! I live again Leaving for Seattle in about an hour. The cruise has left me muy tired. I am looking forward to May when I can have a little breathing room. Just got back from Mexico. I have one day before flying to Seattle. I have an urge for peanut-butter cookies. Going to try travelling light. While looking thru an old box I came across a large squid plushy. I'm now closer to realizing my dream of remaking Mega Shark vs Giant Squid Leaving for Mexico tomorrow. Cabo on Tuesday, Mazatlan on Wednesday, Puerto Vallarta on Thursday. Return Sunday. Then to Seattle on Tuesday. Did my taxes two weeks ago. Just finished up with Ira's. Because he's being taxed at my rate (the dangers of living with mom) he's hurting. wants to read Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theor... by David Aaronovitch - Today I saw two gray whales "date"; was in the middle of a pod of hundreds of dolphins; saw some orcas; & yes, sea lions were involved too. Wind has died down...the whale watching expedition may actually transpire. I was suspecting another cancellation with the winds this morning Clock has changed; now sunrise is 7am-ish & sunset 7pm-ish. This is the dark time of the Fast. But I have whales to look forward to.I hope. Whale trip cancelled again-winds are too strong. Will try again tomorrow. Must find camera. Only thing keeping me going is Smalville renewal Smallville still renewed :)  -but whale watching cancelled :( -company refunded price & we rescheduled :)  -& company comped our tickets :) Smallville renewed for a tenth season & tomorrow I watch some whales on a boat somewhere off of Malibu. Can life get any better? Perhaps ... Got back from Philly an hour so ago. I feel like I am of the living dead, but too tired to go to bed just yet. Lots more to do this weekend. Flying to Philly on Sunday. Ira will be coming along. While I'm in meetings he'll be communing with our nation's past & future. I'm jazzed. Had massive computer breakdowns (two laptops & desktop) all at the same time. Have been online sporadically, but I think I might be back on. Following the NORAD Santa Tracker at http://www.noradsanta.org/  It's totally surreal. Dinner's here & Rudolph viewing in t-minus 6 hours... I am skipping the walk today. It is 36 degrees, there is a frost/freeze alert, and I do not have the proper outerwear. Yeah, I know...WIMP!! It's another pizza and mothra night at Casa Taborn. Tomorrow I con't catching up on 5 mo of neglect. Did the smog test today. Tomorrow, DMV! I ate all the cinnamon chip bread before Ira coud have some. He is heartbroken. I feel such guilt. Any ideas how I could make it up to him? Just finished 5 month non-stop project at work. Head hit pillow last night at 9pm & I awoke 7am. I've not slept 10 hours straight in decades Running late. Chilly 42°. Watching last night's FastForward. Originally thought it was lame but compared to V, this show's brilliant. Bummed I'm ba-ack! It's 63°; No sweatshirt for me. I've Crash to watch; 2 mi of turf beckon me to tread upon it. It already feels like a new month, Running late as usual. It's 64°, can you dig it? Walked a mile at work yesterday at lunch. Call me a walkin crazy person. I need a pedometer 60 degrees this morning! Yes, I said 60 degF!!! Anyways, off to the walk. Today is Friday Night Lights - I am not into football but love FNL 42 degrees; running late for the walk AGAIN; I have no idea what I will watch this morning, I guess i will go with whatever catches my fancy I'm incredibly late for my walk (bad Kym); it's 42 deg (brrrr), but I'm doing Smallville & it's what Lois did when she was missing. Woo-wee! Mothrathon begins in 60 minutes. It's widescreen but sadly dubbed. Promotes itself as "cosmic adventure of color and fantasy." I'm so there. Big night at Rancho Taborn tonight! BIrth of Mothra I/II & pizza! Anticipation is getting. too. intense. Neither Ira nor I've seen it before 48 degrees; not too cold but not just sweatshirt weather. This morning's viewing list includes Flashforward. Haven't made up mind about it. G'day all! It's 61 degrees-only a sweatshirt needed this morning. Tried 2 Melrose Places yesterday-not successful. Friday Night Lights today Morning walk! It's a crispy 43 degrees. Double dose of Melrose Place this morntide. Never watched the original, not to sure about the remake Prepping for walk. Temperature's 49 degrees. I'll still need gloves. It's a Doctor Who morning! Only 2 mi today because busy day ahead of me Prepping for morning walk. Temperature's 46 degrees. I've decided on a medical theme this morning: Mercy and Trauma; & I have gloves! Ciao!! Didn't set the alarm; got up an or so hour ago. I have much work to do today so it looks like no walk for me on this beautiful crisp morning Just got back from an amazing They Might Be Giants Concert at UCLA. It's 12:30am & there is no way I am getting up at 4am to walk two miles! After the 3rd mile, I went for one more. Watched Smallville & SGU. Smallville: Wonder Twins & all knocked it out of the park. SGU, too arty 3 days ago I expanded my morning walk from 2 miles to 3. I am not sure if I am getting any extra benefit, but I now watch more genre shows!! It's Smallville Night & not with just one Wonder Twin, but two! I'm tired today so I may have to wait until tomorrow morning to be Twinized! Yeah, morning walk. Get's kinda repetitious, I know. But I'm trying to keep active even tho' my inner sloth begs to differ-FlashForward in 5 Just about out the door for the morning walk (yes, I know I'm really late - but cut me some some slack here, it's a Baha'i Holy day today!) About to head out for morning walk - can't watch V because we are watching it tonight (and I am still bitter they moved it from LA to NY)... About to go on my morning walk (& I know, very late); and I'm more excited than I should be; I'm going to watch the season finale of Mad Men Hold the presses! Pam Grier will play Dr. Amanda Waller on Smallville... all they need do now is sign Gina Torres. O, how I love Smallville! @AppleEl - I fear that the Wonder Twins will be the vaccine for any Smallville flu, addiction, or whatever evil that show casts on innocents Found out the Wonder Twins will be on Smallville this Friday. This may be the magic moment that ends my Smallvillian love affair. Stay tuned Done with morning walk. Watched Eastwick in hopes it'd be shock treatment for my Smallville addiction. Was traumatic but sadly didn't work. @thomassimpson Re; Xenafan.com and Whoosh.org - "but I've kept the ligths on". I like that. Thanks, Tom. @lidaverner Re: Whoosh - the site is still up, to be a sort of virtual museum to what was one of the first internet fandom sensations. About to go on my morning walk; I was hoping I could watch Madmen but my DVD recorded from last night is taking too long to convert to AVI!! has reviewed the book American on Purpose - http://bit.ly/tVWe6 has read American on Purpose by Craig Ferguson - http://bit.ly/tVWe6 Watching Smallville: Don't approve of Zod & Tess; fearful of Chloe & Ollie; Lois & Clark inevitable; but think maybe Tess & Lois would work. Why am I happy? Actually, more like not really that concerned. I now have an excuse to travel the life less virtual. Hey, great poem name!!! Laptop died. Desktop has weird glitch where I can get email but not send. Have to hop over to gmail to send. I am actually happy about it. Epiphany time. I've come to terms that I'll never work on Whoosh.org again. I'll keep the site up but I know the passion will never return. 1st rain of Fall 2009!! Last year was 10/04 and 2007 was 09/21. Do I detect a pattern here? Break out the fisherman sweater and hot cocoa!!! Smallville 903: MIght be lamest episode yet! ZOMBIES! Degrassi High did it much better, BUT, Ollie still shirtless and lots of Clois staring Gave blood today so I am on a NutterButter high. I usually use up all 140 characters but it looks like this time I won't-Wait! I did make it Apparently moviefone.com doesn't list all the films playing at theaters; Govinda at the Laemmle in 90 minutes; I am **so** there; thx Narin. Smallville 902: Even Lois noted Tess' "problem" with getting beaten up; Chloe still mad; no Ollie, but maybe because Metallo was shirtless? I am totally bummed because I finally have some free time to watch a movie and not one Indian movie is playing at the Laemmle this weekend!! Primo Smallville premiere: Lois Fu, Oliver shirtless, Tess chose to be tortured again, Chloe’s p.o’d with Clark and all gratuitous of course I finished watching McLeod's Daughters. That's 224 episodes! Took me about three years to get through them all. But I did it! AND LIVED!!!!! Got my extender off today! After a year I can eat again without the fear of choking always looming...Ortho said braces be off by end of year Discovered that Arizona watermelon juice cocktail is sold at the local 7-11. This news totally makes my day. Am fighting the urge for nachos Preparing for Pirate Fest day 2.  I did pan fried noodles yesterday at the fest (yeah, I know), but today I am going to go German sausuage. Went to Pirate Fest in Ojai (actually Lake Casitas but who counts) today & going again tomorrow. Ira purchased pirate garb today for Sunday. Went to Ojai Valley Museum in morning to see the Sergio Aragones exhibit & then later watched Whiteout - not a great film but not bad either I have discovered that Philadelphia is just a huge Ben Franklin theme park where some people live 24/7 Packing for Philly & can't decide if to take personal laptop w/me. Also hope nothing catches on fire in my neck of the woods while I'm gone. Fire contained! Now I can go to sleep. The only news I am getting about the fire is through Twitter. As a joke Ira  suggested looking at Twitter, and there it was. Sheesh. @Chrissy_Lee Yes, there is a fire. It's just west of Parkway Calabasas. The only news I am getting about the fire is through Twitter. As a joke Ira  suggested looking at Twitter, and there it was. Sheesh. I don't get it There's been a wildfire in Calabasas right next to the Las Virgenes exit for an hour now and nothing on TV or the internet Where I am staying at in Orlando is tres expensive so the big event for tonight will be going to Walmart! I have my grocery list all ready!! Leaving for Orlando tomorrow. Ira will be arriving Friday. Saturday we do EPCOT & then Sunday it's lunch w/ an astronaut at the Space Center Finally leaving for ComicCon. Hoping to get there before 5pm. Looking forward to seeing old friends and seeing new stuff. And I am thirsty!! Lots to do this morning before leaving for *COMIC CON*. Yes, I know I am setting myself up for disappointment, but I really need serious R&R has reviewed the book I Can't Think Straight - http://bit.ly/kwZ5T has read I Can't Think Straight by Shamim Sarif - http://bit.ly/kwZ5T I'm going to Comic Con with no internet connection (work or personal) and no work cellphone tomorrow. I'm going to try to make a clean break I've decided my next binge TV watchings will be Rush season 1, Burn Notice season 2, Leverage season 1; & I've started to prep for ComicCon. I am actually taking a lunch break & eating some Tokyo bananas that Ira gave me. They are twinkie-oids with an indescribable banana filling. Ira has successfully returned. First thing he wanted off the plane was an "American breakfast". We hit the airport Dennys and now are home. Ira is in US air space! Currently just into Alaska at 35,000 feet and going 510 knots. What a relief! 3399 miles done, 2894 more miles to go Apparently, Ira's flight left two hours ago. However the trackers have not picked up on it yet. Maybe when the flight gets closer to Alaska? Ira's flight is still delayed. Thunderstorms in Beijing. Put on a pot of tea, found some chocolate. It is going to be a long 12 hours plus. Oops, I meant 12 hours. Want to follow Ira home? He's on Air China 983 Beijing to LAX. Just put flight tracker in google. Some are graphic! Ira's plane in Beijing has been delayed for a few hours. Hopefully he will take off in the next 45 minutes. Then, he'll be home in 11 hours! Finished Harper's Island and what a waste o' time! I am on a quest for a new TV obsession. I am taking suggestions. Maybe Leverage? Cleaner? I am watching Harper's Island. About to start episode 4. I am beginning to think I should have started watching V: The Final Battle instead. Watching V (always go for something resistancy July 4th; last year RiffTrax Independence Day). Metaphors are too clunky but gotta love Diana is reading Hawaii: A Novel by James A.

FYI I do not distinguish between terror and crime @ChrisBoese I thought a terrorist is political (fighting for a cause) and a pirate is economic (trying to make a buck). Getting psyched for five straight uninterrupted work days - might actually get something done this week. Woo-wee! Just got back from Pirate Adventure Dninner Show - not as good as Medieval Times! @ChrisBoese Getting a refund? @ChelSierra I found a program called Replay AV which I use for all my downloading/streaming needs (video & audio).
