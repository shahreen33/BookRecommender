I'm drafting up a new ending and I have barely a clue what I'm putting down. XD Day 3 of #NaNoWriMo2016: 5,024 words written, bringing the total to 15,179. I'm on a roll! #amwriting @markiplier I demand a video compilation of all the attempts Mark makes before he finally makes that shot. :D Day 2 of #NaNoWriMo, and I wrote 5,049 words. My total is now 10,155 words. I'm 1/5 of the way through! My word cushion is soft. #amwriting Time to try one of the books I got from a #BooksAreMyBag event: #TheDeadHouse by #DawnKurtagich.

My brain goes 'if you do 4-5k a day you could do it by Oct 31st'. HOW ABOUT NO!? D: #amwriting Day 26: 3,553 words written. Total now of 52,404 words. I've broken the 50k mark in October. Bring it on, #NaNoWriMo! #amwriting #amediting After a few days' break, I'm back on the writing today.

Not my usual genre but very enjoyable to read! #amreading Got down about 2k on side projects, and 1.5k on the novel before my brain quit on me. At least I got some done! #amwriting #amediting Wrote 2k so far today, but it's been split between several misc. projects. Time to get some work done on the actual novel. #amwriting I should add that, when it comes to writing, quality is better than quantity. 100 good words is better than 5k of rubbish ones. #amwriting Day 21: 5,022 words (a personal best this month), bringing the total to 44,469 words written this month. Nice! #amwriting #amediting This is absolute genius! I want one! But which books would I pick? :o https://t.co/Zd1Ieq4NU2 Day 20: 4,035 words, bringing the total up to 39,447 words.

I hope I can do it. #amwriting I've seen some amazing things on Twitter today.

I've got a six month plan, at the end of which I hope to start submitting to agents again. #amwriting Having a lot of fun putting my #bulletjournal together. I really hope this helps with my writing. #amwriting @markiplier Blame Wilfred Warfstache and his uber-pink moustache. *gasp* This means that moustache is dyed! Scandal alert!

I may have to consider going to this! :D https://t.co/7QCz0msWwY One of these days I may actually write something... :( @MrRayhonda There's a new one? Why have I not heard about this!? When the author's website says the next book in your favourite series is out this year, but Amazon says June 2017... https://t.co/eqalJFKnMu @Salsbod I know nothing of actors/actresses, so I couldn't say. XD Any suggestions? @Salsbod Oh, definitely. It's got serious film potential there, or at least a TV series. :) @Salsbod Yay!

Not seen it myself. #amwriting When you read your story aloud to see if it reads right and hate the sound of your own voice. #amwriting #amediting https://t.co/ulslfyhmpM Point 7 makes me laugh because I am teetotal.

That's minus the new ending, which I'm expecting will be maybe another 20k or so. @HaleySulich That's something I'd definitely consider. I haven't even priced up editing yet, but I know I'd need to save up for it first. @HaleySulich Nice! I'm still editing it myself at the moment and writing a new ending. It hasn't even been beta-read yet. @HaleySulich Definitely want to go for the traditional route. Self-publishing would be a last resort for me. :) @HaleySulich Fantasy series set in a world where the gods are dying and taking their magic with them. :) Worked out what bugs me with my writing. I don't show enough emotion, and I think I still tell more than I show. Better fix that. #amediting When you enjoyed a book so much you're sad it's over and wonder what you're going to do with your life now. #amreading #readersproblems Just finished #TheMuse by @jesskatbee.

I should probably fix that or I'll never finish this novel. #amwriting Been waiting (im)patiently for my glasses to arrive. In the end I tried reverse psychology and said I didn't care anymore, and they arrived! When you just get into the flow of writing... and then have to go to work. D: #amwriting I did not miss it!

When you open the cupboard to find it bare of snacks and you think 'But how can I write without snacks!?' #amwriting #CampNaNoWriMo A first draft is MEANT to be crap. Forget quality; just get your story down. Then you can refine it. #amwriting https://t.co/Dl2DaPWNCj Can't wait to meet one of my favourite authors next week. I won't drop names, but I'm really looking forward to it. :) #amreading Broken the 7k mark. Only aiming for 25k this camp, so I'm not doing too badly. :) #CampNaNoWriMo #amwriting It's more fun to write with friends. On my own it's too easy to slack off. :) #amwriting #CampNaNoWriMo @silvanhistorian Oooh, now that makes it even more intriguing. :D Well, it's time to get cracking! #CampNaNoWriMo #amwriting @silvanhistorian Ooh, I like Keystone as a title. So many questions. What is the 'keystone'? What does it do? So interesting... :D Started today with just 1,214 words. After writing with my cabin, I'm now at 4,681! Great work, my friends! #amwriting #CampNaNoWriMo @poesiedelalune I am so not ready. D: I was going to add that I'd have to be a hermit for a month... but I already am a recluse so that's nothing new! XD How the heck I'll cope with giving up the last two for a month is beyond me. But 'tis a sacrifice I must make! 2/2 If I'm going to make it through #CampNaNo, I'll have to avoid all my vices... like Twitter, YouTube, and my favourite game livestreams. 1/2 Just one more day until #CampNaNo starts, and I'm still not prepared. I'm such a slacker nowadays. @_@ Sometimes you have to learn to just keep your trap shut. Easiest way. :( RT @TheUnNovelist: All #art is a kind of confession. James Baldwin  #amwriting https://t.co/AORblXVmGf Even if I were to re-read my favourites, which would I read? Francesca Haig? Trudi Canavan? Taran Matharu? Too many choices! #amreading Good thing: I want to read. Bad thing: I want to re-read my favourites instead of the book I'm supposed to be reading. #amreading @MrRayhonda Dammit, watching you play this makes me want the game. So I'm downloading the demo right now. -_- I still lament not completing two of my fanfics, but my original projects take up most of my time now. Credit for having the courage to apologise. Making mistakes is one thing: to accept and learn from them is the true lesson. #amwriting So someone plagiarised parts of a fanfic I wrote, and mailed me to apologise and to say they've taken the story down. #amwriting RT @MrRayhonda: Accept everyone for who they are. Don't judge. All that matters is if a person is nice or not. Not their race, religion, ge… Can't wait to see #JessieBurton, author of The Miniaturist and The Muse, next month. Last author I met was my old college tutor. :D This will be me when the Final Fantasy 7 remake comes out. :D https://t.co/lCmzptfqY3 @asexuality I get a virus warning when I try to go on the forum. Are there any issues? When someone calls and asks for 'the word' and you nearly answer with 'THE BIRD IS THE WORD'. #FamilyGuy #wastedopportunity @MrRayhonda You could put a poll up with various games and do a vote. In the end though, play what you want to play. :) Going to re-read book 1 of the Ascendant Kingdoms Saga, Ice Forged, by #GailZMartin. :) #amreading @TaranMatharu1 I've just finished. Loved it. ^^ #amreading Now reading Summoner: Origins by #TaranMatharu. Why I haven't read this sooner I have no idea. :\ #amreading Finished Taste of Darkness by #MariaVSnyder yesterday. A good series in all. I enjoyed it. #amreading @MrRayhonda Happy Birthday! Have a great day! :D @parcelforce Buying an item from Japan to UK and may use EMS (which gives Parcelforce as an operator). Will there be any additional charges? @SooPGabeZach @muyskerm Told ya it would be good. :D Just finished Scent of Magic. Time for a quick break and then it's on to the last book, Taste of Darkness. #MariaVSnyder #amreading Writing what now? I avoid romantic scenes as best I can. #amwriting https://t.co/hE65T3pjX6 Finished Touch of Magic. Now about to start Scent of Magic, also by #MariaVSnyder. #amreading You say 'weird'. I say 'unique'. @Jack_Septic_Eye Who cares about the comments? The most important thing is you're enjoying yourself! Keep it going! :D When you have to stop reading in order to go to work. #amreading #readersproblems I struggle getting into the 'zone' lately... How do you get into your zone? What do you do if you struggle? #amwriting @muyskerm That was one of the funniest streams ever. I'd definitely say upload it so everyone can see the fun. This is the problem I currently have. XD #amwriting #amediting https://t.co/Dmed9ZCjf7 Damn you, YouTube, you foiled my reading plans again! D: I think it might be time to read a bit more #TouchofPower by #MariaVSnyder. #amreading :) @MrRayhonda Glad that you're okay now, Ray. Panic attacks aren't fun. Play some games and chill. :) Almost halfway through #TouchofPower by #MariaVSnyder. Taken a while to get into but I'm getting there. #amreading @YahooCare I've done checks with two programs and it hasn't come up with anything. A friend of mine has said he is having the same problem. @YahooCare I keep getting infected with a self-replicating virus when I go on My Yahoo. I haven't opened any emails/links.

I really need to finish drafting my new ending, but reading is also calling to me. #amreading #amwriting Best description of a book ever.  https://t.co/VDY5SdMQwH The problem with e-reading... staring at the Kindle wishing it would charge faster. ;_; "Don't only practice your Art, but force your way into its Secrets. For it and Knowledge can raise Man to the Divine." Ludwig van Beethoven @MrRayhonda *hands you a Phoenix Down* Decided to re-read #Starborn by #LucyHounsom read for the release of #Heartland next month. Looking forward to it! #amreading I've submitted once, and been rejected once. It's not so bad really. Take the plunge and go for it! #amwriting https://t.co/p8EJCaeCEM @MrRayhonda Yuko Mizutani's died!? No! She was a VA in my favourite childhood anime. RIP Mizutani-san. :( When you don't know which book to start reading next... :\ #amreading #readersdilemma Just finished #TheInquisition by @TaranMatharu1. What a riveting read, and an unexpected ending! Definitely met my expectations! #amreading Less than 100 pages to read of #TheInquisition by #TaranMatharu. I'm not likely to finish tonight but let's see how far I get. #amreading I knew someone who was 45 minutes late once. And I was fifteen minutes EARLY. Oh, the internal rage that day. XD https://t.co/am8MzURLKX @TaranMatharu1 Fantasy rarely gets the attention it deserves when it comes to movies, so I'm kinda glad many don't get adapted. @muyskerm Boy, am I glad I checked Twitter! Now I can order dinner! :D *bounces off happily* As someone with social anxiety, I find it important to support #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek. A little support goes a long way. #MHAW16 Why can't we get paid to be observed writing our novels? XD https://t.co/XijrrxCCSW @MrRayhonda Keep working at it and you shall succeed. These challenges are there to keep driving you forward. Never give up. :) @ItsFoodPorn @MrRayhonda I need that cake in my life. :o I need to take this advice and actually finish writing up my new ending. :\ #amwriting? https://t.co/IzY2cEAGh5 @Liberty_GamerDH @muyskerm Nyuu, I think that may be a bit late for me. Oh well. Have fun! :D Finished #MapofBones by @FrancescaHaig this morning. Loved it, yet again I have to stick the pieces of my heart back together. #amreading Ooh, so looking forward to this coming out. Even just that one sentence intrigues me so much. :D https://t.co/IhdLEK9RIr @TaranMatharu1 Amazon lied to me! It said the 10th! But at least I have something to read while I'm off work now. :D I thought #TheInquisition was out next week! So it was a nice surprise to see it in store today! Now it is MINE! @TaranMatharu1 #amreading @Jack_Septic_Eye Neither. I'd rather be a Digimon Tamer. :) I need cake. *off to the shop* When it's 5:30pm and you're already thinking about going to bed... #tired Happy Birthday to meeeee.... Happy Birthday to meeeee.... Happy Bir---ooh, chocolate! *nom nom nom* #birthday Rereading Dragons of Autumn Twilight. Ah, Raistlin, how I missed your sassy bitchiness. #Dragonlance #amreading @markiplier I have no selfies. I hate pictures of myself, but I also don't have a reverse camera so any attempt would be half a face. :\ @Liberty_GamerDH Why, yes it would. However did you guess? ;) Eagerly waiting to see if a livestream I usually watch on Mondays is on today. Either way, curry is calling to me. :D I should be writing, but gaming is calling to me... #amwriting? #gaming @LixianTV I'm glad you like it. ^^ Wow, the shop only had one copy in! I'm glad I managed to nab it before anyone else! #TheMapofBones @FrancescaHaig #amreading Yay, I get to pick up the next book on my reading list today! :D #amreading RT @libbabray: Because every book you write is a rewriting of your self, if you let it be. It is change. And change is hard and scary. And… Yeah, this is me. XD https://t.co/mMAu05SVM9 Just finished #AngelofStorms by @TrudiCanavan. Incredible. I could barely put it down! So when's the next book coming out? :D #amreading All right! I've broken the 12k mark! I get to start work on drafting up my new ending soon! #amwriting #amediting #CampNaNoWriMo Okay I spotted this ten minutes late, but I'm jumping in! Here I go! #amwriting #CampNaNoWriMo  https://t.co/zdSTdkLatw When you have an epiphany that solves a problematic plot point and sets the stage for the future story. #amwriting https://t.co/QxaCRJdeXy I see all the pictures and my 'workspace' feels so lame.

My current word goal is 4,309 words! Not a bad start! My word cushion is comfy! #amwriting @TheBHF Will the results of the sweetstake be placed on the site today? I can't find anything about it on the site anymore. #DECHOX #CampNaNoWriMo is almost upon us! Is everyone ready!? :D #amwriting So can't wait! Question is: do I re-read The Fire Sermon before it comes out? #amreading https://t.co/jxxNSQXQYD 369 pages into #AngelofStorms by #TrudiCanavan. Absolutely loving it. I feel so sorry for Tyen, though. #amreading Well, I wasn't expecting that to happen! :o #amreading #AngelofStorms #MillenniumsRule #TrudiCanavan I think I'm gonna set some time aside tonight to just chill with a dvd and read. I'm really into this book. #AngelofStorms #amreading When you start dreaming about a book you're reading, you know it's a good one. #AngelofStorms #MillenniumsRule @TrudiCanavan RT @TheUnNovelist: We write out of revenge against reality, to dream and enter into the lives of others. F du Plessix Gray #amwriting https… Okay, I'm four months late but I'm finally starting #AngelofStorms by #TrudiCanavan today. Better late than never! #amreading Eee, #MapofBones will be out soon! I can't wait! #TheFireSermon #FrancescaHaig Is it not 1st April yet? I can't take much more. O~O #DECHOX When someone asks if they can read your book and you're afraid to let people read it. :\ #amwriting https://t.co/mcYz2hwTFf I'd love to go but sadly I'm nowhere near London. But any other UK writers might benefit! #amwriting #literaryagent https://t.co/ojoQQ71UKF Will I be paying a cheat fine for Easter? No sirree! Not me! #DECHOX2016 RT @TheUnNovelist: Holding onto your hope that you can do it is as important as sitting down every day to write. #amwriting #writing https:… Two weeks until #CampNaNoWriMo starts! So looking forward to writing with my cabin-mates again. Is everyone ready yet? :D #amwriting You know it's bad when you dream about eating chocolate. #DECHOX @TheBHF Wrote just over 1k this evening, which is not bad. :) #amwriting @MrRayhonda Try going to your YouTube settings and select 'Privacy' and look at Activity Feed. I think this is it. @SoVeryBritish What if you're British... and don't like tea (or coffee, or scones...)? What happens to the universe then? :) I'm also encouraging colleagues to pay in to the #DECHOX Sweetstake, with a box of chocolates worth £10 as the prize. @TheBHF Two weeks into the #DECHOX! Cravings are still a problem but I have resisted the urge to pay a cheat fine. @TheBHF Agreed. I met my best writing friends in the @CampNaNoWriMo cabins. We write together every year. #amwriting https://t.co/3pncsxkvyi @MrRayhonda Oh wow, that's awesome, Ray! Nice one! :D Day 4 of the #DECHOX. By the time this month is over I'll have eaten 10x my weight in bananas. *nom* Struggling to get into the 'zone' today. How do you get into your 'zone'? #amwriting #amediting When you choose to sacrifice a scene you like because it doesn't actually progress the plot. #amwriting #amediting Never underestimate the power of sugar cravings. They are hard to resist. #DECHOX #DayThree Seeing chocolate/sugary snacks in people's feeds... What I wouldn't give for chocolate right now... And it's only the 2nd. *flail* #DECHOX Every writer can understand this. It's our way of life. #amwriting https://t.co/mEEph45FvT #CampNaNoWriMo website is open, campers! It's nearly that time! Time to get our projects ready! I'm... revising... again. XD #amwriting If I have a drink whose listed ingredients show nothing but fruit, but still shows as having 10.3g of sugar, am I allowed this? #DECHOX Got my mum to read #TheMiniaturist by @jesskatbee. She loved it but found the ending very sad. My response to finally picking up #BravelySecond today. Let the gaming commence! https://t.co/YTC9A0c3Tc via @YouTube Or have the next week off work. *happy sigh* https://t.co/aHkscGjxUr Cake is especially appreciated. A little bit of sugar is good for the brain. :) https://t.co/JQT7GbrE4O That feeling of satisfaction when you finish a piece of artwork. #amdrawing When you go back to pieces of art you never finished and wonder why you thought they looked good. :\ #amdrawing @Jack_Septic_Eye You actually quite suit them. ^^Do you have to wear those permanently or just when you play? I've only submitted once and got rejected, but I took it okay. Gave me chance to redraft and improve. :D #amwriting https://t.co/Z7ntBX93g2 When you have characters you love so much you could write pages of them just being themselves and not get bored. &lt;3 #amwriting @markiplier Argh! I fell asleep and forgot all about the stream! Better late than ever! Got a full morning at the gym planned. If I can move at the end it will be a miracle! #workout #MyZone #WorkplaceChallenge @MaximumVice @MrRayhonda Thanks. ^^ It was handy that I had an image to refer to so I knew what kind of style to go for. When you know you should go to bed, but you're not actually tired. :\ @MrRayhonda =^^= Thanks. Let me know if you want any more designs or have any other ideas. @MrRayhonda Okay, I'll have a go at that and see how it turns out. :) @MrRayhonda I'm about to start work on the pic. Is there a particular food you'd prefer in the picture? Love it. XD https://t.co/Syu3ROkKEU Well thanks to my slacking I won't finish my draft by February. I'll aim for March then. :\ #amwriting? So jealous of @LixianTV's talent. Animation, #music... I'd love to make my own music one day. https://t.co/JXDxmwV1Kl @MrRayhonda I will have a go at it. :) @MrRayhonda I wouldn't mind having a go, so long as you don't mind anime/manga style. I drew my own avatar. What have you got in mind? Feeling the burn right now... I lack stamina at the moment but hopefully that will build up. #workout #exercise #MyZone #WorkplaceChallenge Playing Papers Please and thanks to @Jack_Septic_Eye I keep quoting 'Glory Greatest Country'.

Spent the whole time listening to music. #amwriting? #fail #procrastination Counting down the days till I can finally play #BravelySecond.

Now for a quick break, and then on to break 2k. #amwriting Okay, I am determined to get some writing done tonight. So I am going to close the internet, turn off the TV... and write. #amwriting @mushenska Would you recommend writers have their work looked at by professional/freelance editors before submitting? #askagent @mushenska If a writer asked, would an agent advise on any areas that made them reject the MS so they could look at improving it? #askagent I find it hard to get into the 'zone' when I'm writing nowadays. The internet is such a distraction. #amwriting #writerproblems RT @mushenska: It's #askagent time!

Perhaps tomorrow shall be better! #keeptrying #amwriting #amwritingfantasy @getboundio The best part is that I can see him doing that, too. And now I can't get it out of my head. Thanks for the mental image. XD That happy feeling you get when one of your favourite characters enters the scene. #amwriting #amwritingfantasy @poesiedelalune Oh yeah. I had a crush on the protagonist of an old story I started for a LONG time. I still have a soft spot for him. I'm currently on my 5th draft. I have one more draft to do after this, then I'll start look for an agent. #amwriting https://t.co/LWiXqSWg6y @LixianTV @muyskerm @MrRayhonda @VoxFireInferno Oh my gosh, I am literally crying with laughter right now. Ohhh yeah. :) https://t.co/YNYnJt6mBD I have about 30k left to redraft to get to where I left off last time, and then I can draft up my new ending. Let's get to it! #amwriting While my Kindle charges up, I think I have just enough time to do a bit of writing. &gt;:3 #amwriting Getting back to the redraft today. I'm still aiming to finish this by the end of February. #amwriting Reading outside of my genre for once. I admit, it's quite interesting! #TheBonesofYou #DebbieHowells #amreading Well said! As writers we can't please everyone. All we can do is write the story that's in our hearts. #amwriting https://t.co/Ik0NdYx0nJ @Jack_Septic_Eye I think GerIta refers to Germany and Italy from Hetalia. :) @LixianTV I always regret not being able to play any of these games.

It was a lot of fun, though I think this is the only one I can do this year. :( #amwriting The @NaNoWriMo Virtual Write-In is about to start! It's official NaNo time! Is everyone ready!? #writing #feedblobby2k15 @markiplier I feel like that most of the time. When I get home from work I don't have any energy left to give to being social. @markiplier It never rains but it pours. *insert cricket sounds here.* @Jack_Septic_Eye Holy cow, those were weird. The sacrifices you make for entertainment. You may now scrub your eyeballs clean. RT @SoVeryBritish: Realising you've got about fifty grand's worth of plastic bags under your kitchen sink. Reading Challenge: Read the two books in my last tweet before I have to pack them for my move on Saturday. #amreading #challengeaccepted For a change of pace, going to read #KingdomHearts and #ChainofMemories before going back to #MariaVSnyder for the Healer series. #amreading Just finished #Spyglass by #MariaVSnyder, completing my re-read of the Glass and Study series. #amreading @markiplier I'm so glad. May things continue in this positive vein for you. :) @Jack_Septic_Eye @markiplier Remember you always have friends/family to help fill that void. It's looking like #NaNoWriMo is back on the cards for me. Yippee! I was devastated at the thought of having to skip it this year. #amwriting @jesskatbee I used to write a lot during my lunch break but now I crave fresh air. Early mornings are my most productive. (go 5am writing!) RT @empathintrovert: Empaths take on the emotions and feeling of others .. Not on purpose but by nature @Jack_Septic_Eye Just continue to be yourself and you will never fail. :) Told myself if I bought snacks I must write at least 1k. I shouldn't bribe myself, but sometimes you need an extra incentive. #amwriting Lots of reading progress today. Finished one book. Almost halfway through another ('Sea Glass' by Maria V Snyder). A good day. #amreading No worse feeling when you have force yourself to remain 'active' as opposed to having necessary 'shut down' time. https://t.co/cp91hJbUOa @Jack_Septic_Eye Well said. I hope all Mark's followers do their all to ensure his channel doesn't suffer. I'm glad he's taking a break too. I need to set some dedicated writing time again.

I've been reading for two hours and my body's forgotten how to move properly. #amreading #StormGlass #MariaVSnyder @markiplier I'm so sad to hear what happened. Take all the time you need. My love to you, Cyndago and to Daniel's family. @Jack_Septic_Eye Watching this made me get the game, but I can't get it to load. CURSES. And it looks like so much fun. @Lexirad Headless Mombi frightened me for years. It's still creepy. @Jack_Septic_Eye You look great! And don't feel bad about 'jumping in'. I felt Mark needed encouragement and you will have helped him. ^^ @yenpress Are there plans to release volume 4 of the Kingdom Hearts 2 manga? @TheUnNovelist Hm, points 1 and 2 I may need to look at. @ktheunamazing @Jack_Septic_Eye @markiplier Holy crap, I never even thought.

I just had a dream in which I dreamt I was dreaming. Double-layer dreaming. WHY? #Dreaming Although... maybe I should decide on which character viewpoints I'm focusing on before I start. @_@ And today I start work on the next book in my series. The first book took me nine months. Let's see how long this one takes! #amwriting RT @xCatherineHx: Its so sad when you work so hard to get something only for it to be taken away as soon as you get it Hee hee. I've set up my blog. :D Novel formatted and ready to publish. Just waiting for my cover artist to finish the cover. :) *holds up completed novel* Nine months of work, and I finally have my finished piece! #amwriting Taking a break from editing for a few days before my brain IMPLODES. #amwriting (?) @David_Suchet I just watched Curtain.

And I'm only 1/5 of the way through! #amwriting @lainitaylor Some of my comments were apparently made in the 1600s! Oh and the 1930s. I've been writing a LOOONG time.

No chance of finishing it this year now, but I can live with this! #amwriting Hmm, I think a change of scenery is in order. Perhaps I shall set up the laptop in the dining room and write in there. My slanket is the best thing ever.

Not. *trying to stop hands from trembling.* Hee, under 25k to go to the end! I'm unlikely to finish this year now; I've deliberately slowed down so I don't exhaust myself. #amwriting Just worked out on average I only have about 1,000 calories a day. I thought it would be higher. Go me? :) Woot, just eight chapters left to redraft. 26k left. :) #amwriting Ah, 4:30am... it's been a while. I am a cleaning machine today!

What the hell--Twitter, you look different! Oh yeah, just 30k of the novel left to redraft. #amwriting At last! My face is back to normal! :D The anaesthetic wore off! Yahoo! It's been three hours since the dentist. I'd like the feeling back in my face. Or enough so I don't have to worry about burning myself. @GemmaWilshaw I'm thinking of doing it in the new year, once Christmas is out of the way. New Year, new me. :) @GemmaWilshaw I've been thinking of getting low-lights. :) @GemmaWilshaw If you insist. :) @GemmaWilshaw But I had one on Monday. That's why I'm resisting.

Still on track to finish this year. :) @1WishAway Maybe people buy it just to see if it really is as bad as the reviews suggest. Totally enjoyed me and my mum sitting on a bed reading last night... with the cat trying to join in. :) At last, mum is a bookworm. :D Just submitted my novel to @Luludotcom's #letsgowrimos Accelerator Program. I should have my review by 31st December. *nervous* #NaNoWriMo @Luludotcom Thank you! I shall do so now! :D @Luludotcom Has the problem with outside US phone numbers been resolved? RIP Nelson Mandela. :( Just found out the #WrimoAcceleratorProgram by @Luludotcom is accepting currently unfinished novels. I am so applying! #writing #NaNoWriMo Just 40k to go to finish the second draft. #amwriting @neilhimself Does exercise mean 'writing'? I hope it does. Otherwise I've been doing it wrong for years. :D Just got back from scoring an outdoor netball game and now I can hardly feel my fingers. #frozen @LBartoszek We have paper-chainitis. I appear to be immune or at least have a high tolerance. I only made about six before getting bored. Well, just 45k left to redraft to complete the second draft of the novel. My aim is the end of the year. :) #amwriting @mushenska When you're submitting an ms, do you send the whole ms with the query letter or just a sample chapter(s)? #askagent @Luludotcom Is the Wrimo Accelerator only available to currently finished novels? I'm expecting to finish my 2nd draft around late Dec. @mushenska I'm the same. There have been few books I've actually given up on. That's why I'm picky about the books I choose to start with. And it's done! I won! 50k! I battled procrastination, boredom and illness and came out with my desired goal! VICTORY IS MINE! #NaNoWriMo 2k... 1k... #countdown #NaNoWriMo 3k to go... #countdown #NaNoWriMo RT @__GrumpyCat: I cant wait for the holidays to be over 4k to go... #countdown #NaNoWriMo Less than 5k to go!!! #NaNoWriMo @lizzyjharper14: You can do.

I quite want it framed. http://t.co/nqak1JhUPg 2,500 words written today, and now I have a headache. But I managed to break 31k! #NaNoWriMo Almost at 27k. I can do this, right? #NaNoWriMo On a second wind for #NaNoWriMo. I've just hit the halfway mark. I have NINE DAYS to find another 25,000. #amwriting @1WishAway Or rewind it so I can redo it now I'm not ill! @1WishAway True but it's scuppered my plans of finishing this second draft this year. Oh well. I'll have to aim for next year. :) @1WishAway I'm failing. I fell ill last week and haven't written since. So I'm stuck at 21k. I've officially thrown in the towel. Apparently I was crying out in my sleep last night. Damn fever. XD #ill @WriterlyTweets @neilhimself Oh dear... My flying dreams always turn into nightmares. This is not a good sign. :( #writing Aching so bad... someone please kill me... #ill #haveacold @JannaKaixer EMERGENCY! The chocolate has gone!!! No writer can write without sugary snacks! *flails in a panic.* I did it! I'm finally back on target for #NaNoWriMo. Now the only words I need to do now are from today onwards. #amwriting @xCatherineHx And chances are the ignoramus thought he was all big and funny. &gt;.&gt; @xCatherineHx Did you slap him? @ManchesterWriMo I tend to listen to ambience music. At the moment I favour dark ambience. :) Now at 19k, just 2,500 behind the target. Now for a break, lunch, and then back to writing! The gap is closing! #NaNoWriMo #amwriting *stops writing.* That's it... 2,600 words done today... I can't take anymore... I'm so tired... #NaNoWriMo #amwriting #needsleep 16k into #NaNoWriMo. Still lagging behind. If I can just push myself a little further so I'm not further behind tomorrow. #amwriting @GemmaWilshaw Hey Gem, what do I need to pick up from town again? :P @WriterlyTweets "Ouch, my fingers have gone numb." Day 1 of #NaNoWriMo and I have 3k done. One of my buddies already has 8k... I cannot see them for dust. #amwriting It's only 7am and I've already hit my daily word target! Not a bad start for Day 1! #NaNoWriMo #amwriting #NaNoWriMo BEGINS! #amwriting @NaNoWordSprints Just spotted these. I have my novel at the ready. :D T-Minus 1... #NaNoWriMo I reached the 60k mark.

Will I make it before #NaNoWriMo #amwriting Well, this is something I haven't felt for a long time. Didn't think I was capable of it anymore to be quite honest. @_@ Also almost 50k into the redraft. I aim to be 60k into it by the time #NaNoWriMo starts. :D #NaNoRebel Reworking this whole scene. It works a lot better, but the content brings up such strong emotions... #amwriting #personalexperience @LBartoszek Oooh, have a good evening. I will think of you as I curl up in front of my fire. :) First part of the novel re-drafted. Two parts to go. :) #amwriting 4 hours of work and only 1000 words to show for it... I shouldn't watch TV while I'm trying to write. #amwriting #fail RT @BrianRathbone: Writing something terrible is better than not writing anything, you can always whack it in editing, and at least it got … @1WishAway Yes. Yes it is. :) Ugh, that's enough writing for one night, I think. Curse you, fatigue. I was enjoying that writing spree. #amwriting 37k into the redraft. I want to get up to 50k by the end of the month so I can do the next 50k during #NaNoWriMo #amwriting @GailZMartin I heard there are more exceptions to the rule than the actual rule itself! Well as much as I'd like to keep on writing, I'm just too tired! #sleep Wow... I actually did it. And it was taken quite well, too! :D 30k into the re-write. Only another, what, 130k left to do. XD #amwriting Three concerts coming up in November, and potentially playing live for Radio Lancashire. Why is life so busy? #violin #orchestra Whoo-hoo, I'm an unofficial editor. One of the orchestra girls has given me her novel to edit. Well, 18 pages so far. *cracks knuckles.* :D My pen drive isn't showing the document I did at work... again. This thing is so useless! I hope it's there when I go to work tomorrow. Ah, hit today's target. Been a while since I wrote this much. I can feel myself getting into the swing of it. But now it's time to rest! I need to write 1,500 words each day to finish the second draft of this book by the end of the year. I think that is doable. :) #amwriting I turn on the computer to do some writing... and end up spending an hour watching videos on youtube. #typical #procrastination I grow seriously tired of being the sole one to start conversations even though I am not the chatty one. #preferssilence @xCatherineHx I'd love to go on holiday again. Haven't been since 2010. @LBartoszek This is me, literally!

Not bad, enjoyable. Currently re-reading the #RileyBloom series by @AlysonNoel. I still stand firmly in the Bodhi camp. :) Just sent the first draft of my novel to a friend for beta-reading. She was too impatient to wait for the 2nd draft. #nervous #writing @cazbarbie The way I see it, it's something to look forward to each week. And if it makes me happy, then it is good. :D @cazbarbie Or when the company knows your name, address and order as soon as you give your number. &gt;.&gt; #pizzalover @LBartoszek You sound surprised. This is Britain! We ought to be accustomed to it by now! :D How many times does someone need to ride up and down the street at high speed on a motorbike before growing bored? RT @saladinahmed: Don't ask writers where they get their ideas. Ask them how in the hell they manage to actually get books written. Just picked up @PianoGuys album in-store. Yaaay. :D Also loved #NigelKennedy at #LastNightoftheProms last night. I have never laughed at classical music so much before! :D Maybe I should invest in an electric violin, then I can just turn down the volume and practice all I want? Why is it only at, like, 9pm at night, that I get the urge to practice my #violin? @daraobriain Wow, that was rude. You're entitled to enjoy a pint and a game in peace. I'd never think to bother a celebrity if I saw them! @GemmaWilshaw I was in the bath! I don't take the phone with me. @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek Awww, they are so adorable! I want them! &lt;3 Ugh, totally slipping out of rhythm with this redraft. I've ditched my tracker since I'm now due to finish in February. Need to get in gear. Ah, Monday... we meet again... wish we didn't... You can tell it's a bad day when I start reading my old school reports. @_@ Had a bad day so not in the mood to write today. :( Maybe tomorrow... maybe... #bediscalling Third chapter redrafted. Onto the next one! :D And that's my 2k target hit. Now to reward myself with some gaming. To the XBox! #gamer @JannaKaixer Get motivated! *dances* And that's that scene completely redrafted now. It looks much better. Now I can carry on with the rest of this chapter. #amwriting And that's enough work for one day. Time for some sleep! Beginning of chapter 3 redone. Now to redraft it and bring it up to scratch. #amwriting Had a couple of days off writing to let ideas form for the next chapter, which needed a full rewrite. Will commence tomorrow! :D @LBartoszek Whereas we in the north enjoyed our sun and sweltering heat! :D #northerner Wow, I've managed to write... ten words. O.o My brain is not in gear, clearly. Day 5 of the redraft. I've redone 8k so far. I want to break 10k today at least. Argh! Nothing is working! #nothingfillsthevoid And according to my word tracker, I am due to finish the redraft by the beginning of November. SWEET. :D Turns out my document was corrupted again. Luckily I remember how to retrieve it! #hazardsofawriter @1WishAway I'm really hoping the one at work has what I redrafted or I'll have to do that whole scene again! And yet again I have to redo my work... though I may leave that section and pray the backup I left at work still has it. #amtryingtowrite Almost finished re-drafting the first chapter. :D #amwriting Phew, redone that which I had lost. Now to carry one. :) I've lost about 700 words of work because my document didn't save properly! ;_; *time to do it again!* Another 1k redrafted. I also have a word tracker set with estimated completion by the end of the year. I'm due to finish on 23rd December. 1,000 words redrafted. Only 159,000 more to go. XD It seems such a long way away. #amwriting I've decided to do the scene chopping/analysis as I do the redraft, since my original method was boring. Therefore, on with the 2nd draft!!! @GemmaWilshaw Does grandad Bill know this? :D @GemmaWilshaw ahhhhh. Bought her prezzie at the weekend. "All of the Bakewell Tarts have gone. SEND HELP." "Don't worry. As long as there are scones left, we're safe." "They're gone." "...DAMN." @GemmaWilshaw Starts at 12? O.o YES! I remembered to bring home @lainitaylor's #DaysofBloodandStarlight! Now I can read! YAHOO! *shuts out reality and begins.* @GemmaWilshaw It's a bank holiday on Monday so I should be able to make. :) @GemmaWilshaw We do. You live a bit far away for me to just pop down anymore. XD @GemmaWilshaw I will have to explore them and see if any of them smell nice. My #HarajukuLovers perfume is almost empty. @GemmaWilshaw @cazbarbie @LBartoszek At least the Britney ones look more within my price range. #cheapskate RT @AuthorDanBrown: It's time to take a stand: No More Spoiler Alerts! It's time for your friends to read INFERNO. #NoSpoilerAlerts http://… @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek @cazbarbie I'm almost out of perfume. Any recommendations (cheap ones, preferably!). I've had a break from taking down notes the past few days, but tomorrow it's back to work if I want to start the redraft in September! :D @neilhimself Absolute class. :D And, inspired by #Inferno, I am now reading #DanteAlighieri's #TheDivineComedy. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here! Finally finished reading #Inferno by @AuthorDanBrown. Some twists I did not expect, and a thoroughly good read! :) RT @LBartoszek: Some people love me, some people dislike me. Either way it doesnt really matter. I am me. You are you. Life's too short to … @LBartoszek Well said, sis. :) Again with those moments where I wonder why I bother speaking to some people when they do not acknowledge that I have spoken. #wasteoftime Just picked up @lainitaylor's #DaysofBloodandStarlight... but I left it at work. DAMMIT! No weekend reading for me. #patienceisavirtue @GemmaWilshaw I will yes. Still only halfway through #Inferno. One of these days I'll put down my writing and actually finish reading it. #DanBrown RT @PunkinOnWheels: My PROCESS: 1) Write sentence 2) Check Twitter 3) Edit sentence 4) Check Twitter 5) Stare at sentence 6) Tweet about "P… I spent this morning writing out brief profiles for some of the minor characters before I lose track of who is where and why. #amwriting Make that 11 chapters. Notes got sporadic from that point. :) One evening's work and I've finished up the notes for two chapters. A few sections need rewriting but I'm leaving that till last. Hard at work going through all my notes in the story draft. Not even through with Chapter 1 yet. I made a lot of notes early on! #amwriting @1WishAway Yup! I'm probably going to do some scene-shifting/cutting as well. I hope to start the redraft in September. :) @1WishAway I'm spending time going through all the notes I made in the draft, and then commencing the redraft. :D Right, time to lock the writing away for a while. It's time to get some cleaning done! :) Well, it's official. Some people are really loud. -_- Now that I have finished the first draft, I will rest for a month before beginning the redraft. Hmm, don't I have a fanfic to work on...? Four months and 159,956 words later, I have finally finished the first draft! I am so happy! Thank you @1WishAway for getting me motivated! 5k written today. Tomorrow I should finish the last chapter and, hopefully, the epilogue. Tomorrow could be the day! #amwriting Onto the last chapter of my novel! Minus the epilogue of course. :D @1WishAway I did want to comment at your earlier update but I didn't want to give any spoilers away. :) Also realised earlier that I actually drafted the last chapter of this story before I did the rest of it. XD So I just need to update it! Eh, no writing done this morning. My brain is too tired. *finishes the next chapter* If my estimates are right... two more chapters and an epilogue to go. #amwriting #soclose *turns on a rain sounds track and almost deafens herself.* ACK! *turns down the volume.* @___@ My novel's broken the 150k mark! And I'm only a few chapters away from finishing! #amwriting #soexcited So close to the end of this story now. I think I may be about two or three chapters from the finish! :D #AmWriting It took me three hours, but I did it. Writing session complete. Now, to sleep. Argh, I haven't done any writing today! Curse you Neil Gaiman for distracting me from my writing! Just finished @neilhimself's #TheOceanattheEndoftheLane. Read it in a full day. Could barely put it down! :D Halfway through #TheOceanAtTheEndOfTheLane by #NeilGaiman. It's quite creepy. I've only ever read #GoodOmens and #Stardust. Another day, another few thousand words to write... *sigh* ...... Who am I kidding? I LOVE IT!!! :D #AmWriting Also considering using speech recognition software to speed up the redraft process. Speech is faster than typing... It's worth a go at least 2900 words written today. I'm well on track to finishing this draft this month. #amwriting #excited @TrudiCanavan I struggle writing novellas. I much prefer writing epic novels. :D How can you fit everything into a smaller space??? And thus #CampNaNoWriMo comes to its end. With 60k written, I am pleased. Now I can start over tomorrow and aim to finish this novel! Only one day left of #CampNaNoWriMo. I'm at 57k. I wonder if I can take this up to 60k by tomorrow. #amwriting 2,300 words written today, bringing the novel to over 130k. This is going to go over my 150k target. Need to tighten this up. #amwriting Phew, 1,400 words written this morning. Not a bad start to the week! :) All right! It's back to work! Let's see if I can finish this novel in August! #AmWriting I've had a week's break from solid writing since completing #CampNaNoWriMo last week. Tomorrow it's back to work! :D Longing for bedtime. :) And I've finished! I've written 50k! #CampNaNoWriMo. With over a week left of #CampNaNoWriMo, I am almost finished! I'm at 48k! Today is the final push! :D #Writing Up to 36k in my writing challenge. Just 14k more to go to reach my target of 50k. The end is in sight! #CampNaNoWriMo @1WishAway I got 4000 done yesterday. :D I don't think I mentioned, but my novel is now over 100k! Time to start moving things towards the conclusion! #Writing @KayFire2065 Thank you! I was really expecting to barely scrape through! I got my exam results and got a merit! I am genuinely shocked! That means I am officially Grade 2! #Violin That moment when you wonder why you even try to make conversation with your 'friends' anymore. :( The sun is shining, the heat is amazing even in the north... what do I do? Hide in my house. XD @GailZMartin You know I've lived in the UK all my life and I've seen practically nothing. I don't even know my own hometown very well. @_@ Also, one of my fellow campers has decided to challenge me to a race to complete our weekend targets. #CampNaNoWriMo #readysetGO I physically... cannot write anymore... so tired... Almost at the 20k mark for #CampNaNoWriMo, which means I'm almost halfway through! Overall I'm at 95k. :D #Writing Dammit I missed the perfect opportunity to post a picture of Crowley and Aziraphale. Oh well, here it is: http://t.co/VVhxIE0j5N #goodomens At least two people have called me a 'perfectionist' now. @_@ Yes! After two days of no productivity, I am back into the swing of it! #writing #CampNaNoWriMo @1WishAway I share your pain. :( @lainitaylor I would say the words 'I love you' would sum all that up quite nicely. :) And in the first week of #CampNaNoWriMo I have managed to write 15,000 words. Not bad for a first week! @LBartoszek @andy_murray Oh yes! Totally deserved! Excellently played. :) Should also add that my OVERALL word count so far is 89k. :D Haha, almost a full week into #CampNaNoWriMo and I am 13k in. Aim to be 15k by tomorrow. Not bad for a first week, eh! RT @TheVelvetNap: “@ReadDanLevinson: “Writing a first draft... I'm simply shoveling sand into a box so that later I can build castles.”  ― … @1WishAway I'll be sure to have a stern talk with them. DX @1WishAway I went to Disney for two weeks and caught a cold three days in, and was just recovering from that when I caught another one! Two hours, forty-two minutes to exam time. *accurate time is accurate* Today is the day of my Grade 2 #violin exam! Wish me luck! *can still barely remember my arpeggios.* @cazbarbie @GemmaWilshaw *gag* XD @GemmaWilshaw Though lack of WKD from me, but plenty of pizza. :D #teetotal Why hello there, migraine. I am ready for you. *Anadin Extra.* In the words of Phoenix Wright: TAKE THAT! Must... write... another... 500 words... to hit... daily target... Must... write... *falls asleep at computer; please check back on Day 4.* At last I've found out the name of the gemstone that's been nameless in my collection up until now. It's a Eudialyte! 8D http://t.co/EAGDEfcyeE - my response whilst playing the fourth trial of the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney game. Now Phoenix can say it for me! Totally loving the Phoenix Wright movie. Hiroki Narimiya makes an adorable Phoenix! :D #phoenixwright @lainitaylor Send it to the UK! We had a very late spring and are still waiting for summer! We can offer ungodly sums of rain in exchange. Wow, I've written over 4,000 words today, and that's in-between violin practice, a walk through town and a gym session! #timewellspent Well I'm already at 4k and it's only lunchtime! And I've been doing fifteen-minute violin sessions, too! Now for some well-earned lunch! Whew, that was an hour-long writing spree and I got 1000 words done. Now for some violin practice #breakinguptime And #CampNaNoWriMo begins! #writing Awww yeah, #campnanowrimo starts tomorrow. Let the writing frenzy commence! I'm definitely going to fail this exam on Friday. I physically can't stretch my fingers as far as they need to go. :( Well I'm at 75k in my book, which is my planned halfway mark. So I'm roughly halfway through. Awesome. All set for #campnanowrimo #writing http://t.co/P9LjRbjPZl - because #grumpycat is awesome #lovetard @TrudiCanavan Of course it is! There's nothing wrong with cake for breakfast. It's tasty, and makes you feel a little happier. #cake @1WishAway I also got a copy. ^_~ Have to finish reading another book first but yours is next on the list. :) Aw yeah, back on track. #writing Argh, so restless! Must. Burn. Off. Energy. But how! #walkingincircles Today has been an off day for writing. :( But who doesn't have off-days? I'm still on track to reach 75k for #campnanowrimo And I hit today's target today too! Just 3k more before I'm at my target start point for #campnanowrimo. But am I gonna stop? Hell no! RT @1WishAway: @KayFire2065 Yay! That is awesome! All right! I've hit the 70k mark! Just 5k away from my targeted 'halfway' point. Which means I'm roughly halfway through! 8D #writing I worked out I only need to do roughly 1,600 words per day to do 50k in a month. I think that may be a doable target! 8D #nanowrimo #writing Not even 7am and I've hit today's word target. Just 6k more to go and I hit the 75k mark, and then I'm ready for Camp #NaNoWriMo @LBartoszek Enjoy. :) Ah that was a good concert. I may be biased but I think we did well! Well I was considering going into town but likes like the weather has decided otherwise! :D #rain Nothing like some #MorningMusume in the morning to wake you up! Just a month to camp #NaNoWriMo. I'm 64k into my novel... can I make it to 75k before camp starts? #writing Hee hee, I'm at 64k now. Hurtling towards my targeted halfway point. #writing @LBartoszek I confess I'm only about 100 pages in. I keep getting distracted. :) Turns out my document was corrupt. Lucky for me I had a back-up, otherwise I would have lost more than half my work! D: Having problems with Word. It shows I have 60k clocked up but is only showing half of what I've written. #whatthehell @LBartoszek My Saturday night was filled with music and me wondering how the hell to blag my way through a concert. :P Time to get ready for Concert No. 2. Now to find something to wear again... Probably the same ensemble as last week. #lazy Nothing like a day-long migraine to wear you out. #hateheadaches Having a break from writing today. Gonna sit and play me some FF3. Wow, the concert went really well! I got to sit at a 'reserved' table and everything! It was awesome! All dressed and ready for the concert this afternoon. Wearing black pants and white t-shirt with a black bow. Smart, at any rate. @1WishAway I need a paragraph. A sentence is too short and I can easily be distracted. Once I write a paragraph I know I'm on a roll. :D Only got 735 words written today. Had a mood dip today so not in the mood to write. Bedtime now. #sleep @LBartoszek That is somewhat more passable. :) @LBartoszek Personally I have a weakness for checkered shirts. I love them. :D @LBartoszek Pretty? @_@ Who is this person of whom you speak? XD And I can't help but prefer wearing black. @LBartoszek And the only blue shirt I have is a t-shirt, which really isn't suitable. XD @LBartoszek My work clothes pass as my general day wear and going out wear. I only buy stuff that can pass as all three. :) It'll likely be my work pants and a black shirt, like the male members. I don't see why I should wear a 'summer dress' because I'm a woman! I'm absolutely not wearing a dress to the concert tomorrow. Let's see what's in the wardrobe I can get away with... Day 31 and I wrote 2,895 words. I'm impressed that I'm managing to hit my targets lately! :D #writing Aw yeah. 7am and only 400 words away from my daily target. Now that is progress. #writing Okay, 30 days into the writing challenge and I wrote 3,263 words today. Nice. My overall total is 52,247 now. Even better. :D #writing Apparently I'm playing in a music festival next weekend. That makes three concerts and an exam in a four week period. #whatthehell #violin @GailZMartin *notes April 2014 in her calendar.* :D RT @PianoGuys: It took a lot of guts to ask http://t.co/bMkN3pKVFB @cazbarbie NO. XD *throws a victory dance as she reaches the 50k mark, about a third into her desired target.* #writing @1WishAway It is hard to fit everything else in when there is so much writing to be done. #writing @cazbarbie Likewise. Exercise would help my anxiety but, eh, effort. XD @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek You may say that, little one, but you will still wake up in your own bed. Mwahahaha! Also, Word thinks I last worked on this story on 1st January 1601... I must say I look good for someone in their 400's. :D Can I find the drive to write 1000 more words and bring my total up to the 50k mark? #writing RT @LBartoszek: Tickets bought to see @Imaginedragons @O2academybrix on 26th Nov #boom #bringiton !! #imaginedragons #radioactive http://t.… @LBartoszek REVENGE OF THE PLUSHIES! I was having difficulty with the opening of this part until I made a slight change. Now it works better. #writing Ah, anxiety, I can see you and I are going to be at loggerheads for a while. #battle All right, I got some basic plot work done for this section, enough to get me going. Now to start drafting. :D #writing Day 28 of the writing challenge. Four weeks in. Got 2,377 words penned out today. Less then 3k to the 50k mark. :D Bleh, nothing's coming to me. I need a brief period to plan out the plot of this section of the book. -_- All right, I am now recharged. Feeling a little anxious, but I know the perfect cure: MORE WRITING! Hmm, I appear to have reached a momentary standstill. Time for a break and a recharge, I think. #writing Whoo hoo! I've finished Part One of my novel. Now on to Part Two! #writing Back to tracking. Day 27 of the writing challenge and I got 2,259 words, bringing the total to 45,290 and thirteen chapters in. Aww yeah! :D @LBartoszek Movie and supper Sunday? That sounds like fun. :D I am wearing a skirt for once! The world must be ending!!! *stretches.* Ah, a new day and a new chapter. Let's begin, shall we? #writing Thanks to my redraft this morning I'm still not sure how many words I've done today. But suffice to say I hit the 43k mark. :D Ah, that's that scene redrafted. I hate having to have regular wrist-resting breaks. But oh well. Time to play some #worldofwarcraft Can't comment on how much I wrote yesterday, since I'm redrafting that scene this morning. XD Oh well. RT @1WishAway: “It doesn’t matter what others think about you. Their thoughts can’t hurt you. Only your own paranoia can do that” -me Also, 40,000 words later and two of my main cast finally meet! It's like 'FINALLY'. XD Day 24 of the writing challenge and I got 2,362 words! ...I think. Can't remember where I started from! Now to rest my wrists. #strain Aw, yeah! 40k mark! Bring it! Cursed wrist strain... why don't you just go away! #canonlysleepnow :( Day 23 of the #writing challenge, and I got 1,454 words, bringing the total to 37,835. Heee! 8D Progress on my writing has slowed because my brain keeps thinking up ways to improve what I've already written. I don't want to backtrack! Day 22 of the writing challenge (yesterday) and I got 833 words. Whoops! Back to writing tomorrow. My wrists are no longer hurting. At least I got some basic plot work done this weekend. Also may have to slow down on the writing front... my wrists are showing signs of strain from over-use. Day 18 of the writing challenge (yesterday) and I got 742 words, bringing the total to 35,464. No writing today; needed to give my wrists a rest. Back to working on it tomorrow, though. :) Since starting the writing challenge, I have written 19,000 words! AWESOME! If I'd stuck to my targets, it would have been 32,000. Oh well! Day 16 of the writing challenge and I got 2,486. My total is now 34,793. :D #writing Now for some #sleep. And typically enough, once I stop writing, ANXIETY ATTACK. #hateanxiety Day 15 of the writing challenge and I got 3,555 words, bringing my total to 32,261! SWEET! #writing Yahoo! Another thousand words. #keeponwriting Yaaay! I hit my word target! But am I gonna stop? No! Let's see if I can write another thousand words! #writing All right, three quarters of the way to my target. Just gotta push myself a little more and I'll be there! :D Day 14 of the writing challenge (excluding the weekend). 1,349 words. But now I have to stop thanks to a possible trapped nerve. #fail Had a break from writing over the weekend but back to it today... but had to stop because I'm either straining or trapped a nerve. :( Feeling positively more relaxed after my self-reflexology hand/foot massage. :) Even my shoulder aches have gone. Aw yeah. :) @LBartoszek I opted for the Kindle version. :) I will be starting that today. :D Day 11 of the writing challenge and I got 725 words. I won't have much time to write tomorrow, though. :( Whoops, slept in this morning so no writing yet. Oh well. It's only 7am; I have plenty of time to make up for it. :D Day 10 of the writing challenge and I am back on form with 3,074 words, bringing my total to 26,624. Aw yeah! #writing @LBartoszek Hm, nah. I absolutely hate facial fur. But that's the whole point of personal opinion, huh? ^^ @LBartoszek No. Just... NO. Aw yeah, target reached. Now to relax for a bit and then get back to work! 8D #writing 400 words into my daily target. Not bad, but I need to be stricter or I'll never finish! I want this book finished this year! Okay, half an hour before I have to get ready for work. TV off. Music low. WRITING TIME. #writing @GemmaWilshaw Sure. I need to remember to update each day. Day 9 of the writing challenge (yesterday) and I got 383 words. I really need to up my game. Day 8 of the challenge (yesterday) and I got 609 words. This is rubbish. XD At last! #Inferno is mine! *laughs maniacally* Day 7 of the writing challenge... 386 words. The zone escaped me again. D: I'm not used to this 'getting ready for work at 7am' malarky anymore. Back to getting buses as well. XP Couldn't find my zone again. Therefore the count for Day 6 of the challenge is 940 words. Total of 22,183. Oh zone, where art thou? XD #writing RT @LBartoszek: Progress so far.A lot to do but not bad for a few hours work I think.Dreaming of hot summer, the ocean &amp; tranquility http:/… @LBartoszek Oh wow, that is beautiful!!! &lt;3 You're getting really good at these landscapes! I love the ocean best! @1WishAway You could say that. Mine is the first book in a trilogy. I can't seem to write smaller stories anymore! #outofpractice Day 5 of the writing challenge (aka yesterday): 1,471 words. Total of 21, 243 words. Now to type up today's notes! :D @1WishAway CONGRATULATIONS! 8D @1WishAway Excellent! You can do it! I have a long way to go. My overall targets are always between 100,000-150,000. Day 4 of the writing challenge. Only managed 445 words today. Total of 19,772. Not a lot but at least I got to almost 1/4 of the target. Must get into the zone... Must get into the zone... #writing I'm reluctant to start reading anything else since I'm waiting for #Inferno on Tuesday. But... I wanna read! @1WishAway Any word you add to the total is worth it. You still got up to the 57k mark! Look at it like that! #bepositive Day 3 of the writing challenge, and my total is 2,345 words, bringing my overall total to 19,327. Awesome. #lovewriting Bleh I fell out of my writing zone. But I'm over halfway towards today's target, so it's all good! :D #Writing Finally gotten around to reading #WildHunt by @GailZMartin. About 60% done. I will finish this tonight, I think! :D @1WishAway I have a long way to go to catch you up. But it gives me something to aim at. :) Day 2 of the writing challenge (I started over since I failed the first time): 2041 words. Total of 16,971. Ohhh yeah. :D @daraobriain Wow, I almost expect you to start doing an evil laugh and shout 'Fear me! I shall smite you all with my lightning powers!' Just a couple of hundred more words to hit the daily word target. I can do this! Just a little more!!! Oh yeah, back on the writing stream. 500 words towards my daily target, oh yeah. :3 Day something of the challenge (lost track because I stopped for five days); 1,184 words written. Total: 14,930. Need to catch up!!! *mutes the tv, puts the headphones on, and buries self in wriitng.* @LBartoszek My initial instinct says chocolate but I'm going to say raspberry. :) And that's #DigitalFortress finished. I'm now up to date with all of #DanBrown's books. Now I just have to wait till the 14th for #Inferno. Argh, I've had this migraine for eight hours now. I can't concentrate on anything with this. *takes tablets* Mission complete: one tired out niece from an afternoon in Jungle Jims. :D @GemmaWilshaw #justasplanned @1WishAway Oh no, no, no. Though I have come to a momentary standstill as I wanted to make some changes, which means I have to go back. XD Intensely, supremely frustrated, so I am taking out my rage by ripping paper into shreds. Such a waste. &gt;.&lt; There, Grade 2 exam registered and paid for. By the end of July I could be a Grade 2 violinist. Woot woot. :D #violin #ABRSM Before I've even applied for my Grade 2 exam, my teacher is talking about Distinctions. #highexpectations #violin @1WishAway Indeed! I'm looking forward to the weekend and seeing how many words I can put away then! I was also given a free book to read and review today for an aspiring author. #WishingonVenus Not my usual genre but I'll give it a go. Also may go back and redo one scene in the previous chapter... too many sudden endings that don't link in with the character's next scene. Day 2 of the writing project and I reached 1798 words. I would have gotten more but I got a TERRIBLE migraine and couldn't concentrate. :( @LBartoszek It's already infecting you, this May thing. It's turning you into a poet. x Okay, it's Day 2! I have orchestra practice tonight so I really have to push myself this morning to hit my goal! 2k, here I come! #writing @1WishAway Oh yeah! We totally are! That brings the current total up to 11,948. Day 1 of the writing project, and I wrote1,996 words! That's close enough! I did want to do more but I ended up writing character sheets. Now at 1,431 words. That is pretty damn good for one morning. Let's see how I do throughout the rest of the day. RT @Gollancz: An author not indulging you, is not the same as an author being self-indulgent. Actually managing to write my novel this morning! Yay! Just got 700 words down. Let's see if I can get over 1000 before work. :D @GemmaWilshaw Good. x *noms on chocolate* @GemmaWilshaw I did't mean you, I meant other people. XD Starting this writing project on my birthday was a bad idea... So many interruptions. I'm at 500 words. Maybe I'd better start tomorrow. @GemmaWilshaw Thank yooou. :) RT @GailZMartin: "Find a story that burns inside until you tell it.  That's the one for you." @GailZMartin After inspiration from @1WishAway, this is Day 1 of the I-have-to-write-this-novel project. My target is 2000 words a day. Wish me luck! @1WishAway Wow, that's a lot of words in a day! I'm gonna try to average at about 2k per day. @LBartoszek Now you're just asking me to put EFFORT into it. XD @LBartoszek Darn it. :( Would it be weird if I just got rice and curry sauce but no chicken? Thank you, #DanBrown, for vividly describing somebody drowning. #fear #nightmarefuel Working on some character sheets for my characters. I need to add a new cast member, I think... but who and for what purpose? #ponder Right, starting tomorrow I am putting my fic writing on hold and attempting @1WishAway's writing project. I will finish this story! RT @LBartoszek: Gr8 advice for any careerRT @BritishVogue I believe whatever u can do u should do to the best of ur ability @victoriabeckha… @1WishAway Keep it up! :D I'm thinking of trying your have-to-write-this-novel project and see if it gets me going! RT @lainitaylor: Just overheard, cafe employee to customer: "Wow, did you finish your lunch ALREADY? You really scarfed that down." Nice. I lost the Game. And so have you. #youlostTheGame @1WishAway Well done. I wish I had that kind of motivation. @russellhoward Oh, I am so tempted to go! I've never been to a stand-up show before. I bet it makes a huge difference seeing it live! One day I will sit down and work on my own novel. -_- Finished #DragonsofSpringDawning. Did want to move onto Dragonlance Legends next, but I think I'll read #MurderontheOrientExpress #Poirot Five days after being ill and I still feel horribly sick whenever I eat. Dammit, stomach, get back to normal! God, I'm so hungry I feel dizzy! *noms on curry like there's no tomorrow!* http://t.co/Z972nrz3p1 - #Peponi by @PianoGuys will always be my favourite piece, though it certainly has some competition! @GemmaWilshaw Yeah; was just frustrated and having a rant. XD I feel better now I've had a good, long rant on #AVEN. Hate it when people go on about their hobbies and try to get you into them, and then pay no attention to you when you share your likes. Also still waiting for @daniellemybella's #Angelopolis. The release date was pushed back to 19th April. #cantwaitanymore Now working my way through the last book of the #Dragonlance Chronicles, #DragonsofSpringDawning. Amazing how much I've forgotten! I've just had the nicest compliments about my writing that I have ever had! I'm so honoured! #grateful After the weekend from hell, I am happy to announce that I am well again! ...Mostly. XD This piece inspires me to write epic stuff. http://t.co/2w162WdyX8 #inspiration #ninetyninenights “Don’t only practice your art, but force your way into its secret.

Typical that it's almost the end of the bank holiday weekend and only NOW do I get the motivation to write. #SODSLAW #rewindtime Reminiscing by reading #DragonsofAutumnTwilight by #WeisandHickman. #oldschool #Dragonlance @daniellemybella Except in the UK it seems, where Amazon says released on 11th April. :( #willwaitaslongasittakes That said, I have until the beginning of May to submit an online application, so I have time to practice and decide. :) My teacher and I are giving serious consideration to my taking the Grade 2 exam in July. The benefit of being an early riser is that I can say 'you know what, I'm having a lie in today' even if it's a work day. #methodtomymadness RT @mat_johnson: No advertisement, no review, no reading spreads a book into the world as well as a friend saying these 5 words: "You've ...

Every other week would be more practical. Monday is usually the day I like to go to the gym. @GemmaWilshaw Wednesday is out because I have orchestra practice. And how long will I need to be doing this for? @GemmaWilshaw @cazbarbie Not whilst it's ongoing. I just won't renew it when my 3-month one is up. So I'm good until May. @GemmaWilshaw @cazbarbie I'm having to rethink whether I can afford to continue my membership with my work move. #down70quidamonth @GemmaWilshaw I am indeed off on Friday, and I would LOVE to come. I love the Sealife Centre. @daniellemybella has the release date changed? Amazon now says 11th April!? #angelopolis #dontmakemewaitlongerplease Now onto the last book in the Glass series: #SpyGlass! Just finished #SeaGlass by #MariaVSnyder. An excellent read. Even I didn't know what the truth was after a while! So much deception! @GemmaWilshaw @williamwilshaw It does to Bill. :) @GemmaWilshaw Try to laugh instead. I do. XD @LBartoszek And this is why I live up north. :D That has to rank as one of my worst practice sessions. Not THE worst though! #violin *drags the stool into the front room so she can practice her #violin. @lainitaylor In my case it would be: when I was your age, I'd be lucky if I was allowed on the Commodore 64! @cazbarbie I still think the male species needs to be shot for turning White Day into that. &gt;.&lt;* @1WishAway That's my target as well, and I can't even manage any. #writersblock I need more hobbies to get me off the computer more... but nothing is interesting enough. Even my art is done on computer. *sigh* @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek You love it and you know it! ^^ @LBartoszek @GemmaWilshaw I should certainly hope so! XD #sappysistermoment @LBartoszek @GemmaWilshaw Well I never was 'normal'. ^_~ Had a good workout at the gym followed by a swim... my body will hate me tomorrow. @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek Never bothered with posters on my wall. Feared getting shot, and no bands I liked enough. Should work on my novel today... but fanfic calls to me. #torn @TrudiCanavan I saw a big burning ball in the sky yesterday.

RT @lainitaylor: That's so weird ... the sky, she is blue. It's unsettling, my friends. Like aliens could be peering right in at us, no  ... It seems I've finally settled into a fic to write - #FinalFantasy13 it is. So much for my own novel. Whoops. XD @LBartoszek You could always just sketch various ones and see which ones draw you in. @LBartoszek Some medicines are best avoided. ^_~ @LBartoszek I know that feeling very well when I try and draw. My mind pictures a masterpiece, but can my hands create it? Can they heck! @LBartoszek Too bad I won't touch alcohol. XD @LBartoszek Artist's block? @LBartoszek I have tried meditation so many times but my body and brain just can't relax. It isn't possible! XD I wish there was a common cure for anxiety. Life would be so much simpler. #anxietysucks Well, it seems I start my new post effectively from 1st April... first day in my new post and it's a bank holiday. A great start! 8D Ohmigosh, chocolate poptarts are the best thing EVER. #poptarts #wherehaveyoubeenallmylife @xCatherineHx Well done! :) http://t.co/j0TAe1JMsW MY SOUL! IT'S GONE!

At least I have youtube! :D Though I'm still reading #SeaGlass, I've put it to aside to re-read #Angelology by #DanielleTrussoni ready for the release of #Angelopolis. @GemmaWilshaw Nice one, Harry! :D Ahh, Valentine's Day is here again. And now it can go away. #hateValentinesDay Reading #SeaGlass by #MariaVSnyder. Poor Opal just can't catch a break! You know it's bad when your own mum starts dreaming you have a boyfriend. #cringe #notgonnahappen 72% of the way through #StormGlass by #MariaVSnyder. Why the electronic edition doesn't have page numbers is beyond me! #mystery @GemmaWilshaw Eeep. Hope he's okay now. @GemmaWilshaw Yeowch! :( How did he do that? @GemmaWilshaw :o Why was Harry at A&amp;E? Is he okay??? Been to the walk-in centre for this rash on my arms. Apparently I'm mildly contagious, so no skin-to-skin contact is permitted! XD @daraobriain I know. I didn't realise they were magic. &gt;.&lt; Don't feel too bad this morning! Only slightly achy, yay! :D Back from the gym. Slightly achy, but will probably feel it tomorrow! But I achieved all the targets my trainer set for me! NYAHA! #proud Okay, after chatting with my friend, I'm all set for my first trip to the gym! AWAY I GO! #workout I need to bolster my courage today. Pass me your courage, peeps! XD Currently a quarter of the way through #StormGlass by #MariaVSnyder. Initially I didn't like this series but now it has grown on me! @cazbarbie Yeah pretty much. I'm not used to drawing styles. I usually just draw mops and straight hair. Waves, styles, all difficult for me @cazbarbie Slow. Your hair refuses to look nice. XD I'm persisting though. Planning a trip to #TravellingMan in Manchester. SHOW ME THE WALL OF MANGA! #HetaliahereIcome #lovemanga Finished #IceForged by @GailZMartin! Loved the story and can't wait for the next one! :) Just reached the halfway point of #IceForged by @GailZMartin! Loving it so far. :) @xCatherineHx Congratulations! :) @1WishAway Good luck!!! :) And I have succumbed to the idea that's been floating in my head for this character. It's pointless to deny it if it works so well... Working on chapter 3 of my novel. :) I've got 70 books I need to get rid of, and half my wardrobe, too! Still plenty to get rid of, but... sentimental value and all... @AlysonNoel If only they would invent a machine that turns our dreams into books while we sleep. It would be so much easier. XD Gonna have to go for a lie down. I've had a migraine since lunchtime and it won't go away. #hatemigraines Mission accomplished! Two new pairs of shoes. One low heel and one medium heel. :) Also need to buy some new shoes to go with my new clothes and book my next eyetest. Yupyup! #timetogetmylifetogether Feeling strangely motivated with myself and thinking about joining a gym, yessirree. Watching #TheRescuers Haven't watched this film in years! Whoa, think I went a bit overboard on the clothes shopping. #spentmorethanshould *stretches* A brand new day and a brand new chapter to work on! Let's get started! #lovethisstory Chapter 2 complete! :D Almost at the end of chapter two. Zak's 'adorability factor' keeps growing. &lt;3 Ah, Zak, you are definitely fun to write for. But this sudden twist that's developing in my mind... I'm not sure about it yet. @1WishAway Good luck! You can do it! *still on chapter 2* #longwaytogo Yay, a thousand words redrafted of the second chapter. I'm amazed this is still flowing so well! :D Ah, #procrastination, it appears we meet again. #goaway Six months later, the piano is finally up! :D @TrudiCanavan So true. It is always painful when you have to get rid of old books to make room for more, or start piling them on the floor. RT @TrudiCanavan: It's never a matter of too many books. Always a matter of needing more bookshelves. And/or a bigger house. New character has a name and is coming together so nicely. Ah, Zakori... I can tell you're going to be one I adore. &lt;3 RT @TrudiCanavan: It's been a day of small achievements. Yay to small achievements! A new character enters the play... #needsaname Hm, next week should I just do planning for my novel till I'm on leave, or shall I just draft like there's no tomorrow? #decisions I also bought #kidicarus. Aw, I couldn't find #finalfantasytheatrhythms in the shop. So I ordered it online instead. This is why shops close! They don't stock things. RT @GailZMartin: What goes great with cold weather? A good book! Get a copy of Ice Forged by @GailZMartin here: http://t.co/xw5vLcwQ Finished the first chapter of my book. One down, several more to go. XD Now for a well-earned sleep. :) @1WishAway I suppose so. I've attempted several but always got bored. I'm hoping I stick at this one. :) @1WishAway Congrats! I'm just coming up to the end of the first chapter of mine. XD Added my blog 'The Lost Gods - Grace Barton's Blog' to my profile. Nothing like a little bit of shameless plugging, lol. :) Finished work early today. Now to crack on with some writing. We're playing Palladio in my orchestra. #score http://t.co/y0z7qor5 I am actually enjoying working on this story. Characters are forming nicely, the world is progressing, and a story is forming. LOVE IT. @TrudiCanavan Wow... I wish I could write that quick. So far mine is... 6k. XD Looong way to go. Just a little last minute workout before bed to shake out the tension in these muscles. @xCatherineHx Oh'eck... Good luck. :) But now I am interrupted because I have to go to work. #FAIL Finally working on one of my novels. I'm quite liking how this one is coming together in my head. #winnerperhaps @xCatherineHx Thank heaven for that. -_- @xCatherineHx DAMN. I clicked the link and got a warning page, but didn't go any further. Will I be okay? @xCatherineHx As a recommendation, change your password and see if that helps at all. RT @xCatherineHx: To anyone who got a direct message off me, I didnt send it, twitter has spammed me and sent messages by itself!!! @xCatherineHx Ah, so it's spam? I just messaged back about that one. Luckily my internet blocked it as a warning so I didn't continue. :) You know, I should probably get some work done on my original works and not my fanfics. #lazy #easilydistracted @daraobriain I will resist giving away the punchline for that one on Twitter, but I will say it to myself and laugh. :) @GailZMartin Just bought #IceForged for my Kindle. Looking forward to reading that tonight! 8D Ugh, my wrists and arms are so sore. Last time I write up a 30+ page report at the last minute! #toomuchtyping @GailZMartin @goodreads Thanks very much for the info! I have joined the group and look forward to the discussions! :) #panic Watching @daraobriain #CraicDealer Absolutely hilarious! *puts Daughter of Smoke and Bone on the shelf.* Well that was an interesting story. Will definitely read the next one. @lainitaylor I was bought Daughter of Smoke and Bone for xmas and have just finished reading it. LOVED IT! Can't wait to read the next one! @cazbarbie Aw, I remember that show... @xCatherineHx Get used to hearing that, because it will undoubtedly happen a few times while you are there. #speaksfromexperience Finished the first part of #DaughterofSmokeandBone Oh my word... *moves onto the next part* I could stay up until midnight... but I don't care. XD Night, peeps. @AlysonNoel I personlly love Whisper! :) @LBartoszek 26th March. :) @1WishAway Awesome! How are you finding it? @LBartoszek Hey Lou there's a release date for #Angelopolis by #DanielleTrussoni I take it you will be getting this as well as me? Now reading #DaughterofSmokeandBone by #LainiTaylor @xCatherineHx XD I must have woken up and then gone straight back to sleep. @xCatherineHx So I didn't just dream that!? I thought I heard an almighty crack but I thought I dreamt it. @GemmaWilshaw On a random note, I left a pot of Dairylea cheese in your fridge! Can I collect it? Oh, and my Michael McIntyre dvd. XD Just finished reading #TheTraitorQueen Oh my gosh what an amazing read! I loved it! Wow, I'm already three-quarters of the way through this book and I only started it yesterday! That's good for me! @GemmaWilshaw Yeah. Just had one of my friends randomly ask me to provide an excuse for him not to go into work. XD So you are asking the woman who goes into work whether she is depressed or ill for ways to get out of going to work? #logical #ithinknot Finished #TheRogue by @TrudiCanavan today. LOVED IT. Now onto #TheTraitorQueen #soexcited #bringiton RT @Absolute80s: Worst Christmas Present ever... a Bonnie Tyler sat nav.

It's just finding music I like. XD @GemmaWilshaw What else is Christmas for, if not pigging out on ridiculous amounts of snacks? Finished #TheAmbassadorsMission and LOVED IT. Now ploughing through #TheRogue Just 50 pages away from finishing #TheAmabassorsMission by #TrudiCanavan #lovemagicians RT @OfficalMrBean: Justin Bieber gets 12,000 retweets for saying "thanks" so here is my attempt: thanks RT @daraobriain: Well, well, well, Mr Cab driver. The Crazy Frog remix of Axel F is your ring-tone? I think I win this one. Four hours to the first Christmas concert. Am I ready? No. #violin #needamiracle Just finished reading @TrudiCanavan #TheBlackMagicintrilogy second time through. Now to dig into #TheTraitorSpy #cantwait #heartbreak @LBartoszek Wow, that one is amazing! 8D Raek... should I give you an apprentice or should I not... Hmm... #planning @TrudiCanavan I like the lack of bloodiness in your works. You show there is more to good fantasy stories than hacking and slashing. :) One week to the first Christmas concert and I'm only getting the four pieces I'm missing on Wednesday. #screwed #needamiracle So we're already planning for next year's Christmas concerts? DAMN CHRISTMAS! GET OUT OF MY LIFE! XD RT @stephenfry: No X-Factor fan but I’ve seen enough to be gobsmacked how imbecilic the voting public is. One shakes one head in utter d ... Phoenix Strings is 'not an orchestra for youngsters or beginners, but for lapsed musicians'. Why am I there then? XD #beginner Rearranged my bookshelf and @TrudiCanavan has a shelf all to herself! Though #TheTraitorQueen stands out as the only hardback on the shelf. Also had a peek at the December edition of #LancashireLife where #PhoenixStrings September concert was covered. I am slightly worried that, at three weeks to the first Christmas concert, I don't have copies of all the repertoire. #nervous One of these days I will do something other than stare into space and sleep. One should not watch #MichaelMcIntyre whilst eating. *laughchokelaugh* Just watched #MichaelMcIntyre on his new dvd #Showtime. HILARIOUS. :) @GemmaWilshaw Oh aye? @xCatherineHx Not as many memories as the cartoon series. :) @thesmboyce "Utopia" by Within Temptation. @thesmboyce I walked into Jesse McCartney at a dance show. He was on his way into the toilets and I was coming out. XD Does that count? @thesmboyce 'Tinkerbell' was a nickname I had at school. All because I was short and cute. I was well miffed. I had Tink's temper anyway. :D @LBartoszek Hey sis! How are you doing? @thesmboyce Action, without a doubt. :) Managed about 1,300 words this morning. Drafted out the ending, at least! And NPD has a name at last. A draft name anyway. XD @GemmaWilshaw The neighbours again? @xCatherineHx Who went this week? Whoops, behind in my targets! I gotta get some work done! *rolls up sleeves and begins typing.* Holy cow, for once the radiator is warming this freezer of a house! Well, the front room, at least. *ditches the fleece* @GemmaWilshaw I would like to get rid of books where I'm not bothered about having a paper copy. But that's cost-depending. @GemmaWilshaw In the new year I'd like to start transferring to digital books. Save the trees and all that. XD And save space on my shelf! @GemmaWilshaw Price wasn't too bad, but without seeing what the reading screen is like I wouldn't make a decision. @GemmaWilshaw Screen looks a little more high-tech, and does more what an iPad can do I think. Doesn't show the reading display though. @GemmaWilshaw A kindle would suit you. I'll likely never decide between the two. Amazon's description of the Kindle Fire is rubbish tho. @GemmaWilshaw But there are also so many models, too. :( And they don't look appealing, either. XD @GemmaWilshaw True. I'm still trying to decide between a kindle and an iPad mini. @GemmaWilshaw You can get your books on your iPad you know. Hit the daily target of 2k! I'll try to reach 3k by the end of the day! #nationalnovelwritingmonth Hit my morning target of 1,000. Now to keep going to make up for yesterday's loss! #writingspree *typing away.* Until you get a name, sir, your are hereby known as Nameless-Priest-Dude. NMD for short. LOL.

Thanks to @GailZMartin for responding to my comment on @goodreads. Now I feel  pumped to work on my own books! @xCatherineHx Memoriiiiieeeessss~~~. Try standing outside of Greenbank with rumours of 'burnt toast' or 'bomb' going on around you. :) Workin' on the introduction to the Lost Gods trilogy. I'm liking how this is coming out so far. @GemmaWilshaw Just realised I have orchestra practice on Wednesday (Halloween). I will drop off treats for Harry on my way home from work. @LBartoszek Blimy, you're high up aren't you? @GemmaWilshaw Just keep thinking of that moment when you hand them over. How many pages have you filled? @GemmaWilshaw How much longer until you can give back those forms? @AlysonNoel We tend to stay silent until we've calmed down, then come back together as though nothing happend. RT @TrudiCanavan: I'm writing. Even though my head hurts and my brain is mush. Sometimes the void grows so big you feel your heart will be swallowed by it. @PianoGuys Aw congratulations! @LBartoszek Whereas I have been basking in beautiful and warm Blackpool sunshine. #totallynotmocking @TrudiCanavan I just finished The Magician's Apprentice! I totally loved it. I love the world this series is set in! Really should stop reading and actually write for a change. ...... *turns the page.* @GemmaWilshaw Happy Birthday, Harry! And that's #TheMagiciansApprentice finished. Loved it. Now to browse the bookshelf again! :) I am so tired I feel sick... I can't wait till the new lady starts and I can share the workload again... This is not a one-person job. @AlysonNoel Standing on an endless plain of ice with only the sun in the distance as my guide and light, and being afraid to go towards it. Halfway through #TheMagiciansApprentice. Love reading this and seeing the origins of the things I love in the #BlackMagiciantrilogy. Totally lovin' this book. &lt;3 *throws LotR aside in favour of #TheMagician'sApprentice by #TrudiCanavan. No Dannyl in this one, but oh well. :) @xCatherineHx Unfortunately maths and physics come hand in hand a lot. You need to let her know you're struggling so she can help if poss. @xCatherineHx Wow, that's promising! DX @xCatherineHx to start. He/She can't physically give you answers, but they should give you sites/books to look at to help you at least. @xCatherineHx I would say then, if research isn't helping and you're all struggling, email your lecturer and ask for advice/tips on where... @xCatherineHx What's the topic/question of the assignment? @xCatherineHx Hmm, well in that case you'll need to use the library comps to do some self-research. Choose the simplest one and start there. @xCatherineHx Ahh, welcome to the life of the uni student. :) So many assignments, so little time. :) You will manage it. Had the best dream last night! :D #MocktheWeek and a plate of spicy potato wedges. LOVELY. :) Sometimes to know a thing does not necessarily make you happy. Why am I finding it so hard to settle into a single writing project. #fiveonthego Cut my finger on ice. That smarts. XD @xCatherineHx You 'think'? You mean you're not sure? XD The most I've had in a week is two, so yes, I think you beat me. :) Well the concert went well! Huzzah! @xCatherineHx Unless you can beat my once a week, you're no fatty. 8D Though I should add I've managed to break my weekly pizza cycle. Last rehearsal is done, two hours to showtime! #nervous @RebeccaJoym Just finished reading Stolen Night. Loved it, though it made me cry. I love Vicken! Also glad to hear there will be a third! @GemmaWilshaw Yeah, though I spent the first part of it wanting to smack Lenah. XD Also, Vicken rules. He is my fave. :) @GemmaWilshaw I finished Stolen Night. I was almost crying at the end. Okay, two more rehearsals to go. Added one other on Saturday before the concert. EEP. It's almost here! Rehearsal for the concert tonight. Only one more until the concert on Saturday. Gah, this is terrifying! @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek Well they have soba as a side dish but I wouldn't mind trying the chick/bst w/teriyaki or kitsuna noodles! @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek If they have ramen, I'm game! :) Hawaii is moving towards Japan at 4 inches a year. That means that sooner or later, Hawaii.... *puts on sunglasses* ...will become Kawaii. @LBartoszek Well paintings should reflect the mood of the artist. I tend to draw romantic pieces, which is very hard. @LBartoszek True, and it's not like I don't have plenty of time to practice. :) @LBartoszek Aww, any particular reason? @LBartoszek I think we're a long way before that. From Phoenix I hope to join Blackpool Symphony, and then we'll see. :) @LBartoszek Love both of those pieces. :) RT @PianoGuys: Excited for this next week! We are finally filming our next video! Finished #TheLostSymbol. Now reading #StolenNight by #RebeccaMaizel. I wanna smack Lenah for being an insult to females! Get a grip! The concert is a week today! YIKES! #terrified @xCatherineHx It is nice and toasty in my office! 8D And we only have the summer heating on. XD Well, I finished #AngelsandDemons. Now reading #TheLostSymbol. I'm on a roll! @xCatherineHx You have yet to learn the art of passing the time. The library, surrounding cafes, the close proximity to the town centre. :) Well I finished #AgeoftheFive. Now reading #AngelsandDemons by #DanBrown. Loving it. :) @LBartoszek Oh god not that song... I hate that thing. -_- I much prefer Girls Generation 'Gee'. @xCatherineHx I had the same problem. I missed out on a train pass because the discounts came in after my lessons had started. :( @xCatherineHx How goes the day so far? Watching #nicolabenedetti at the Royal Albert Hall. Awesome as always. @xCatherineHx I would give advice but it's been four years since I left so it's probably changed somewhat. @GemmaWilshaw Just a complete lack of conversational etiquette in some people. XD I don't know why I bother sometimes... @xCatherineHx This coming from an eighteen year old. I'm 27 and I still feel young. You have plenty of time. XD Hatsune Miku - Alice (Live): http://t.co/chdEAmZA - I love her outfit. @LBartoszek Yet it would not be England without it. And people would be complaining that it's too dry and the reservoirs are drying up. :) @xCatherineHx I know the feeling. I totally want to book a couple of days away at a spa or something. RT @LBartoszek: Another busy day painting... see what you think #brighton #artist #painting #beach #britishsummer http://t.co/IfMVaN9L @LBartoszek Totally love the Union Jack there. :) @GemmaWilshaw @williamwilshaw I've got all this to come with mum soon as well. God help me. XD @williamwilshaw Hi Bill! Now to go to the furore of explaining the art of Twitter. XD Hatsune Miku - World is Mine (English Lyrics): http://t.co/KeVSjSgA via @youtube - I'd go to a concert like this, weird as it is! Go Miku! @xCatherineHx Definitely not. XD I laugh when I see people worrying. 2013 will come, no problems. @LBartoszek Awwww, I knew Perle would go in there if someone else was. Love that little grey seal! :D @xCatherineHx Nah, it's actually a sign that we've had a warmer days than normal at times. The clash of pressure and change in temperature. @AlysonNoel If only I could get past the planning stage. I get distracted and wander off and never return. I've dropped 3 projects this way.

Or am I? &gt;:3 Also tempted to go to the Manchester Camerata Orchestra Play Day and get some professional musicians. :) I am officially labelled the 'new lass' in the orchestra, as labelled by one lady who could not remember my name. Must be a cellist. XD @russellhoward I thought Twitter had been quiet. I hope you recover soon. :) @PianoGuys Oh, he could totally do it. XD @LBartoszek You should have learnt by now not to trust anything weather people say. The only way to know is to look out the window. :) @xCatherineHx Pfft, just get an ordinary one and say you could not afford the other one. An ordinary scientific calculator is just as good. @xCatherineHx Garbage. D: Buy a regular, decent calculator, and see what books you can get off ebay or amazon. :) @GemmaWilshaw @lbartoszek Well I'm already endeavouring to turn Harry into an otaku. I've got him liking one anime. &gt;:3 #victoryshallbemine! @GemmaWilshaw @LBartoszek Mwahaaaahaaaa! MWAHAAAHAAAA! I know it's just a symptom of anxiety, but I can't help but envision the worst possible outcomes in EVERYTHING. Wishes courage was something you could bottle and drink. Oh god, so tired... I know that spiders are a sign of a clean house, but does that mean I have to hoover up about ten of them!? Well, I didn't watch ANY of the Olympics... and I can safely say I'm not bothered. XD Congrats to the Team GB athletes though. RT @garthnix: Now by the miracle of modern technology, I am in London. There are times when a personal opinion is best kept to oneself. This is one of those occasions. &gt;.&lt;* And as bedtime comes around, the stomach decides it's finally hungry. *sighs as she puts food in the oven.* *watches the clock tick by, waiting for bed time* @cazbarbie Unless it is natural for you to work hard at being a certain way. :) Terrible. It is so hard to practice violin when you have wrist strain in both wrists. At least I can watch videos. :) @PianoGuys @xCatherineHx Right now. :) It is hard to practice the violin when you have wrist strain... *sigh* @LBartoszek Yes, they are very good. :) What things do you prefer to paint? Wow, I didn't realise you painted these in studios! @LBartoszek Just finished reading Whisper! Loved it! I didn't see a preview for another book... Will there be another? *hopeful face* @AlysonNoel Wow, this is beautiful! :) @LBartoszek Well, tomorrow I go see the doctor about my wrists. Please don't sign me off work. :( And now the orchestra is finished for the summer. I think they still expect me to play in this concert. Cripes. XD Wishes some people would learn not to go to work when they're ill!!! @LBartoszek Oooh, another reason to buy. :) One more day to Dream Drop Distance!!! My bank account is going to hate me. I have to get a Nintendo 3DS for this game. @LBartoszek Will do. I've already told them if we do I may have to ditch them for a day to have lunch with you if you're available. :) RT @PianoGuys: OUR LATEST VIDEO!!!!

I will never be ready for a concert! #violinpanic @xCatherineHx Say goodbye to your childhood Catherine! I totally forgot to get a card in time. :( I'll post one through at the weekend. @GemmaWilshaw Nothing. Just having one of those moments when I desperately need to cuddle something and plushies don't quite cut it. XD It is moments like these when I wish I wasn't single... #needsacuddle @LBartoszek ...... *heads left* XD And God promised men that good and obedient wives would be found in all corners of the world. Then He made the world round and laughed... Turns out we had a VIP at the orchestra--another conductor. And I learnt our conductor played with #NicolaBenedetti. @LBartoszek Yup, all going well. Can't play as well as everyone else of course but I can do a bit. Now to improve and catch up! :) Tonight's my second session with the orchestra. The conductor asked that as many people as possible turn up tonight. I wonder why? :) Curse you, writer's block! Go away already!!! @HetaliaOfficial My favourite moment is England's plan to get America horribly drunk, only to get drunk himself! Season 1 but still classic! *laughs* Oh yeah... I approve of this. http://t.co/e1lyOjUU Another early rise... this time 3am. But I managed to doze between 5 and 6... Just wish I could get rid of this writer's block... Sometimes you just gotta put a man in his place. &gt;:3 @xCatherineHx Anytime, hope you feel a bit better. :) RT @daraobriain: I mean, I'm just amazed somebody hasn't started #fiftyshadesofGay yet. Not suggesting anyone should, btw. @xCatherineHx You won't let anyone down. Everyone will be proud no matter what. :) @xCatherineHx Don't let anyone pressurise you, Catherine, and don't feel scared. *hugs* @TrudiCanavan When it comes to planning out your novels, do you usually start with characters, world planning or the plot? @HetaliaOfficial I'm still waiting for Season 3 to come out over here. :( One month to go. So I'm a Grade 1 violinist, working towards my Grade 2, and to be given a crash course in Grade 3... BRING IT ON!!! Well I went to Phoenix Strings orchestra for the first time last night. I had fun! Will I be going next week? Yes! At last! My writer's block appears to be lifting! I've written 600 words this morning! Huzzah! Still short of the 2k I normally do but hey! The accursed writer's block is still with me. Averaging about 100 words a day. On another note, 100th post! :) Woot! I called the conductor of Phoenix Strings and I'm invited to attend the rehearsal on Wednesday to have a look-see! :) @cazbarbie @xCatherineHx - aww, hope you two feel better soon! Maybe one of these days I'll get on with some writing. @LBartoszek Ooo! Sounds interesting. I can't wait to see it! :) Decisions between what you know you should do but you don't want to do. -_- I could also be playing #PhoenixWright. Gah, so many things to do. Do I practice my violin or do some writing? I also wish this migraine would go away. XD @NickyBenedetti Very simple. We swap for things like cola. Caffeine rush. :) Heya! I loved the Abhorsen trilogy! @garthnix Gah, I don't know what to do... I need to call the guy from the orchestra, but I'm just so nervous... Maybe I'll wait one more day. Wow, what an interesting design for a building! @LBartoszek Plushies... good to cuddle, but they don't quite fill the void. I need a giant plushie. RT @daraobriain: Irish fans now singing "We'll sing when we want, we'll sing when we want, Fuck you Roy Keane, we'll sing when we want". ... Argh! Once again, the female characters lose all sense of likability once they fall in love. Auraya, you lost my respect! At last my obsession with reading is starting to subdue. Perhaps next week I can get on with some writing. :) Ugh, curse you anxiety. Breathe deeply and slowly they say... that just makes me worse!!! Love how people are so nice to the England team when they win, yet turn to bitches if they lose. I feel sorry for the players. XD Halfway through Priestess of the White and I am shocked by the number of sex references. These priestesses are hardly 'holy' and 'chaste'. @xCatherineHx I have faith in your ability to do well. :) Hi, I just finished reading the Black Magician trilogy. I loved it. I adore Dannyl. Now reading Age of the Five. Loving it! @TrudiCanavan @AlysonNoel I hope you do a tour in the UK soon! @xCatherineHx As far as they're concerned they are always nice. That's why students keep passing! You'll do fine, Catherine. :) And as I ponder what to do with my evening, I find myself doing the usual... Pondering. XD Has begun a new story series, currently titled 'The Lost Gods'. So far planning is really coming together! :D Well that's the Black Magician trilogy out of the way. Now onto the Age of the Five trilogy. :) @xCatherineHx Sleeping, no contest. :) @InheritanceCP I whole-heartedly agree. Dark chocolate is the best. :) @LBartoszek It is spring in our minds. And the mind is a very powerful thing. :) @GemmaWilshaw I believe it is under discussion. Optioning is where they purchase the rights to make a film if a decision is agreed. @LBartoszek Wow, Louisa! You're really good! RT @InheritanceCP: Why absinthe? Because it ignites easily! Don't try this at home kids.... Seriously, don't. It's a bad, bad idea. List ... RT @Queen_UK: IT'S NOT ONE'S SODDING BIRTHDAY FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. #jubileeconcert @LBartoszek Bill told mum Stevie would be on tonight, but I doubt she's up watching. @xCatherineHx Yeah. Even better was that I was meant to do a portfolio, yet I never had a single lesson all year long. Never did do one, lol @xCatherineHx better than the key skills IT exam.That was just insulting. I wanted to put 'how stupid do you think I am' as my answer. @xCatherineHx I always wish I'd stuck doing Psychology. RT @daraobriain: For the length of Grace Jones's appearance the screens should just scroll "WTF" repeatedly. @GemmaWilshaw Hey sis, did you know that The Immortals and the Riley Bloom series have been optioned by the studio that did Twilight? Now having another go at reading The Magician's Guild. @lukasulic Oh wow! I hope you both enjoy yourselves! :) I recently got into the Riley Bloom books--just wanted to say I love them! I adore Bodhi. Looking forward to Whisper in August. @AlysonNoel Argh, why do people think it is acceptable to play music at 4am!? RT @InheritanceCP: Me, because I actually exist. "@_J_Medina Hulk vs. Christopher Paolini. Who win?" @david_garrett Oh, I'm so envious. I wish I lived in London. It is so hard to find motivation when you don't have any... All right!!! Onto the final battles of FF8! Here we go! *cracks knuckles and commences typing.* Hey Lou! Thanks so much for the bag and the manga! I've already finished reading the first volume! It's so sweet! :) @LBartoszek I'm not far off completing my Final Fantasy 8 novel. Just a few chapters to go. I will certainly finish it in May. :) Then it's Crisis Core! My teacher's gonna speak to the conductor of Phoenix Strings to see if he will accept a Grade 1 player. He usually just takes Grade 3 up. Got a reply from the BSO. They accept only Grade 5 and up. :( @PianoGuys I love it! It's fantastic! Yet I was expecting a dramatic face-off with Piano vs Cello. Instead you left us on a cliffhanger! :) I earned a star at my violin lesson today for playing a piece perfectly. Whoo-hoo! @LBartoszek Oh, I've done that a few times... I just sent an email to the Blackpool Symphony Orchestra. Far too soon but it's worth asking! Further, it would help if I had someone I could practice with. There's nothing like motivation than someone who shares your interest... Seriously need to get some practice in on my violin this weekend. I'll never make Grade 2 if I keep skipping practice! Well, it's time I made myself a hot chocolate, grabbed my book and snuggled down for the night. Whew, that's another chapter done with. Almost at the end of this story! :) The end is in sight! @LBartoszek @gemmawilshaw I would advise waiting until the issue of the Falklands has blown over for a bit. :) @LBartoszek @gemmawilshaw This does not surprise me, seeing as how you've been to so many countries. Any countries you HAVEN'T been to? @GemmaWilshaw Yes, that sounds good. And don't forget we need to plan that spa day, too! @LBartoszek @GemmaWilshaw What, just by spinning a globe and then stopping it? :o I still wanna go to Italy someday. @GemmaWilshaw um, uh..... don't know. XD Clothing? @LBartoszek Don't worry about the timing; I don't mind such things. :) I hope you enjoy Morocco. @LBartoszek Oooh, that sounds cool. :) I will look forward to seeing what you bring back! @LBartoszek Oh no worries. Where are you going abroad to? Don't only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and knowledge can raise Men to the Divine. - Ludwig van Beethoven Just wanted to say you're an inspiration to the violin, and it is because of listening to you play that I am now learning. :)@MaeVanessa Hey, sis! Just wondering how you're doing these days? :) @LBartoszek I’ve just sponsored Caroline Packer to take part in Race for Life. http://t.co/LZ0bZ7Vg @InheritanceCP I posted a question! :) I'm hoping it gets picked, because it's the main thing hindering my own writing. :) Did you know the kanji on either side of your name means 'equal' or 'rival'? @GemmaWilshaw RT @InheritanceCP: Oh hey, Genius and Inspiration had to leave early, but Persistence is still here.... Now, what is it you wanted to do? I'VE PASSED MY GRADE 1 EXAM WITH A DISTINCTION (just)!!!!! WHOO-HOOOOOOO!!!!! RT @PianoGuys: For those who missed it, our latest video is up!  Would you like to see more videos like this? What would you... http://t ... Blasted migraine... stop putting pressure on my eye! @LBartoszek Sounds like you're having fun! XD @HetaliaOfficial Do you know when World Series part 1 will be released in the UK? @LBartoszek Thanks. I did the exam. I messed up a little on one of my pieces because the bow was shaking but overall I think I did well! @LBartoszek Depends. Do you fight and break up, and then kiss and make up? Do you really want to stay or go? Today's the day! Violin exam, here I come! @InheritanceCP I think I expand too much with my scenes! :) Apparently I am a witch who can cast spells through her eyes! Am I cold-hearted? Yes, most probably. RT @ajhmurray: Attention! All news channels! Less football! It's not news. #notnews Writer's block has truly lifted. Another FF8 chapter drafted in just a day. Go me! :) @LBartoszek Aw, that is so cute. Reminds me of what I'm like when I get in from work, lol. :) Did a mock exam with my violin teacher today. Apparently I will get a Distinction. :) I saw this as well. Call me odd then but if I wake up in the middle of the night for a couple of hours I feel sick! I'll sleep, kthx. :) @SQUARE_ENIX_EU I just recently completed FF13-2! Wanted to say I loved it! That's a new game to my story list. :) Well the writer's block has lifted and the next chapter of Final Fantasy 8 is complete! Now for the scenes I've been waiting to write! http://t.co/AF62g6ra - A new waterworld has been identified 40 light years away. Awesome! I often wonder if I dedicate too much time to the writing of my video game novels... It's been about 8-9 years now... But I still love it! http://t.co/0U60MZEx - this is good for a giggle. :) @LBartoszek Thank you! Gosh knows I can come out with random musings and opinions! Hi Wendy! Just wanted to say I love the Chronicles of Brothers! I can't wait for the next one! @roryandwendy Well, I decided to give Twitter a shot! Let's see what it's like! :)
