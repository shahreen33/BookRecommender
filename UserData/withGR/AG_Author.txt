Bonus: he is no longer tutting beside me. Update: tutting man has moved to a totally different carriage. Kind of tempted to get my very crunchy, very loud crisps out of my bag and chomp them beside him. My bad, sir If so I can only apologise for your deep psychological trauma Or maybe she did and that's why you tut every time you hear a baby cry Just going to point out that at some point sir you cried and your mother didn't tut and cast you out He's tapping his fingers. Oh, and now a long laboured heavy sigh. Three tuts. Tut. Now the man next to me is tutting very loudly because a baby dared to cry.
