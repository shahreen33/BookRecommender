Could get people together like last time and then do drinks after? @Evwhite93 I have a 9am start on Thurs too :( The only non-early start I have is Friday but Thursday night is FilmSoc's bad film night... @Jakilutra I just watched the pilot of Welcome to the NHK - intelligent, dark, amusing and intriguing - I look forward to seeing more. #NHK @Evwhite93 The only thing is we have a 9am for Early Cinema - which sounds, to me, like the worst module you could possibly do in film. #FML @Evwhite93 everyone's having a shit day today. The pub quiz tomorrow may lift people's spirits, especially when we win two pizzas #amiwrong The loud music playing next door is annoying mainly because it reveals that my neighbours have an incredibly boring taste in music. @Jakilutra Ah, okay.

Goodnight to anyone who is still conscious at this hour. @gemmalouise_xo Yeah, there was a little bit but not much for This is England. There was more for his first film. Indeed we do :( @gemmalouise_xo @Lukehnicholls I've more or less done mine now - on Meadows though. Now I can start the next one. #reallysickofessaysnow @gemmalouise_xo  Ditto. I'm writing a mixture of bullshit and extended loosely related quotes to fill up the wordcount. What ques you doing? @rosietugwell :( Why did you watch it? I thought you weren't going to. For some reason I loved it - but yeah it is bloody miserable. :( @PeteyRalls @rosietugwell Haha, fair enough. @rosietugwell @peteyralls I've not seen it. I'll have to try and catch that one then. @rosietugwell @PeteyRalls Blue Valentine is pretty depressing but is really good. @PeteyRalls @rosietugwell They don't put the films online, unfortunately. So my lack of TV license means I'm going to miss out :( @PeteyRalls @rosietugwell Drive is awesome. Most films with Ryan Gosling in are brilliant. American Beauty is probably my favourite film. The problem with doing an essay on one of my favourite directors is that I can't watch clips of his films without watching the entire films. @DutchTom Because you are a lazy fucker! I say, whilst sat at my computer in a dressing gown. @rickygervais perhaps you could get Liam Neeson to filter out the ones worth following? Apparently he's always making lists. RT @TheTweetOfGod: .@rickygervais Did I like "Extras"? Ricky, are you 'avin a laff? @malcolmgledhill Cheers! Yeah, I thought it was brilliant. At the time I wasn't actually expecting it to be good at all. Well I should have been writing essay but instead I did a blog of my favourite films from 2012: http://t.co/oQnnqK5C @BrezzyHayter That's awesome. Congrats, mate! @thoughtlessjoll @bexbeesley I think a filmsoc trip in April is needed for this. I think Twilight is underrated - it is really good chocolate. I know tweets about your dinner are dull but damn those roast potatoes I just made were unbelievably good #stillwalkingonthewildside @William__Dawson I might have to give it a chance then. I don't mind Ayoade but was a bit put off by the other panellists. And 2012 wipe is funny within 43 seconds -  'stunning tv footage shows dogs can do Jeremy Clarkson's job with less casual racism.' Was tempted to watch the Big Fat Quiz of the Year but then realised that I no longer find any of the people on it funny. 2012 wipe instead. @rosietugwell Good job! You've done well keeping them the whole year so far. @Evwhite93 Thank you. Happy New Year to you too :) @thoughtlessjoll Nice! I'm surprised it worked at all :D Now I'm going to do nothing productive tomorrow to make up for it. @Evwhite93 Haha... brilliant! We need to play ring of fire again soon, when you return #bestringoffireruleever @thoughtlessjoll Done with 20 minutes to spare! How's your essay going? @Evwhite93 Depends how much drink you give him to drink. Did you teach him the 'in my pants rule'? That probably would be inappropriate. @thoughtlessjol That's a good plan. I'm hoping to finish mine before midnight too. Might have to do some movie marathon after as well. @thoughtlessjoll the awkward part is having to quote Ranka in an essay I'll be submitting her.

I would also suggest that the creatures on Peach Beach on GC are ducks. @Jakilutra you're welcome. Thanks for the DVD. 'With god's help I will overcome this terrible affliction.' I am, of course, talking about the suffering that ensues from Xmas over-eating. @The_Eddpire you could get another version of Mario Kart now @The_Eddpire @DrJenMD Agreed. I watched it at work, as is tradition. @DrJenMD I love HIGNFY. This week's was particularly good. What's not to like about Daniel Radcliffe taking the piss out if the queen? When reading Nobel Prize-winning literature it's amusing to see lines like this: 'Man,' said the man. 2/2... that can be taken as sarcastic. There's no humour in Xmas cards and when there is it is cringey and unfunny. Christmas cards are way to sentimental. I had to resort to the to a 'special' then that can have a double meaning or over the top ones... @Jakilutra No worries. Thanks for checking. What's the Wii U like? @Jakilutra Do you still have a dart board (and darts) in your room? I need to film something, so could do it over Christmas if you have it. Just finished writing a script for a short film - I'm far too wired to sleep now. Now I want to get it made. Need to finish my 2nd film 1st. well... I clearly can't be trusted to do uni work at home - I better go to the library. RT @carverofshapes: Respect. http://t.co/IwqbyuVs The annoyance of hourly trains and why are songs about space good?

Thank you to @Jakilutra for lending me his limited edition 3DS with Zelda OOT and Mario Kart 7. Procrastination has just stepped up a gear. RT @Jakilutra: I won a limited edition super mushroom 3ds a while back, before I started tweeting, which @DanRalls85 is now borrowing :) Loving this song at the moment: http://t.co/ebjvDUaq @PeteyRalls Oh dear. I guess I will just make a 'leap of faith' like fellow, atheists/humanists and will accept the subjectivity of truth. After doing Trainspotting in Film this week my African lit novel, which was fantastic, including right near the end the words 'choose life.' @BrezzyHayter Yeah, it's stupid - plays off outdated, conservative stereotypes. They're also clearly devaluing Santa's role in all of this. @PeteyRalls For example, Schenk was denied a job at Munich uni because of medical testing on people but is a caring doctor in the film. @PeteyRalls  ...were, of course, accountable. I more or less agreed. I think it's a good film but it lacks thorough political engagement. @PeteyRalls ...junge and speer and saying that they're blaming a select few nazis and portraying the German public as innocent when they... @PeteyRalls He was basically saying the Downfall portrayed some people as sympathetic even though they were pretty bad, like Schenk... @PeteyRalls Funnily enough, one of my uni readings for last week was an article by David Cesarani on the film Downfall. @PeteyRalls Yeah, I watched most of it and would agree. They were far better than the opposition. @PeteyRalls That was interesting but has totally curtailed any productivity that I would have had in the time it took to watch this. @PeteyRalls This may be the best one: http://t.co/JxL7R7Bf I love this: Christopher Hitchens defending freedom of expression and Rushdie http://t.co/FbLbJqe3 @malcolmgledhill This surprises me. I guess us British have no depth. However, good essay subject - such a good film. @malcolmgledhill 3 deadlines in the week ahead, which I've already done and another a few weeks ago. 2nd half of essays alll due early Jan. My favourite is 'the US election is a race for 270 votes, that's something UKIP can only dream of isn't it, Nigel.' #HIGNFY I'm loving the fact that Damian Lewis is continually taking the piss out of UKIP's Nigel Farage on this week's Have I Got News for You. No more essays due until January - a break from essay writing at last! @The_Eddpire Cool! I need to get some essay writing done for the next 3 hours or so. So, I hopefully pop round 7ish if that works for you? @The_Eddpire Well, I could probably pop round at some point this evening for a bit of Mario Kart, if you're not doing anything. @PeteyRalls cheers man! @elynnsuah thanks, Elynn :) Getting the exact grade I wanted for my first essay of year 2 - I could get used to this. Super Monkey Ball app for the iphone you say! The only downside is that Monkey Target is far inferior to the Game Cube version. @The_Eddpire Cool. I'll have some lunch and then head over to yours. @The_Eddpire Well, your house is en route to the library... Are you in all afternoon or have you got lectures later? Whether to give myself a day off today or to go into uni for the 8th consecutive day - might as well hit the library. #socoolithurtsrealbad I've submitted 3 essays this semester without referencing Freud, even when the last one mentioned mother issues.
