A lovely restful week off. Do I really have to return to school and classes of teenagers tomorrow? @RobertPFrench Hi Robert. No, my Mike Malone is my special creation - he's a soft cuddly teddy bear of a detective! A lovely restful break. New beginnings. Loving @RobbieSavage8 at the moment. The hair flicks and the grinding tonight - wow. Can't wait to see what he does next week. Half-term holiday! Time to put my feet up and write - after I have finished all of the marking of course.

Bliss! Yet again the weekend is on hold - I have to go school again in the morning. Dark mornings - who knows what's lurking in the inky blackness, waiting for me, as I drive to work? I love it when the kids at school say they hate me. I feed off that energy!! More bad news on the TV. Wages frozen and costs going up. When are the Govt gonna wake up and smell the coffee. We want something doing!! What I need now is a lovely, rich chocolate cake - and someone to make it for me. Loving @RobbieSavage8 on Strictly come Dancing.

The kids at school thought that my shirt looked like a barcode and beeped at me and pretended to scan me everytime they saw me. Jack Sallt is now available on kindle. Wonder if readers will like him. http://t.co/jiwO4KIQ Jack Sallt is finished and the editing complete. He will be hitting Amazon next week. So we are going to get sweltering temperatures. I know it's nice to have a hot Sept/Oct but I'd rather see the sun when I'm not at school It's the weekend and I'm going to busy, busy, busy. I fancy making a chocolate cake, anyone want a slice? Don't you just hate it when your employer messes up and you find that your salary cheque is less than it should be? Half past seven and it is already dark. Funny how the changing seasons always take you by surprise every year. First editing of Jack Sallt complete. Have taken son back to university today - why does it get harder to say goodbye? The house seems emptier every time he leaves. A really productive afternoon - the editing on the new Jack Sallt is nearly complete. wonder if he will be as popular as Mike Malone. It's the weekend - time to read and time to write and time to do the housework!! New books are not going well - too much marking and i am so tired at the end of the day. Roll on summer hols!! Why do you read? Beacuse it is something you love to do, or something you are forced to do? Which of the two will encourage you to read more Every cloud has a silver lining http://t.co/fCxbOQa Forget my last status - I might be smiling but the insomnia has returned. Oh, to be back in the summer hols where all I had to do was write Isn't it funny how a chance remark gives you an idea for a whole new book?

For all you Posh fans check out these match reports from a talented new writer. http://t.co/KjLTTnY Bad luck Posh. It was a really hard fought game and they should have come away with something. A beautiful Sunday morning. Coffee and newspapers. What could be better? @12CMS12 Well done on your first goal for Brighton. May it be the first of many. @DebsRickard Thanks Wow! My new book 'The Hanged Cow' has got 4/5 on the Goodreads site. I'm happy with that! @CashLaramie number 475 lol This is so exciting - I can't wait to see who my 500th follower is.

RT @sfbook: very good article in the Telegraph about the riots: http://t.co/wuhwyPb It is about time that the problem of disaffected youths was dealt with by government. They have no hope so they take and destroy. 47,000 words and counting. Really enjoying writing the new book, it is so different from Mike Malone - there is not a dead pig anywhere! Another wonderful morning, so what have I got to look forward to today? Trillions lost on the stock market, riots? Bring on the chocolate. Have spent all day with my head split between Venice and Norfolk. The joys of writing. Shakespeare said 'if music be the food of love' but I prefer chocolate to be the food of love. My third Mike Malone novel http://wp.me/p1uG85-K How can burning shops, ruining businesses and destroying homes support a grieving family? Am I missing something?

I can think of better things to do in the summer. Now to get ready for a weekend in Norwich. My son recommended 'Money' by Martin Amis, so am going to bed to start reading that. Good night! Have spent all day making stop-go animations. Haven't had such fun for ages. Plasticene is so theraputic. Incredible - it could so easily have been lost forever. http://t.co/cwoXngz From my bed I can see a rainbow. Today will be brilliant! Two more weeks and then I will be free to write. Hopefully Mike Malone's third mystery will be finished by the end of the summer. How beautiful! http://t.co/TQkhtUz @travelingrum Exactly!

I would love this glorious weather so much more if I didn't have to do the day job! I would like to buy a nice pair of strappy, high-heeled summer shoes. Not a lot to ask - so why does every shop I visit NOT have any. Grrr! After two hours walking along the marsh in the beautiful sunshine, coffee and cakes are now on the agenda - and girlie chat, of course. You discover a little bit more about Mike's secret past in this book. http://fb.me/IT2tKWN7 Beautiful day and what am  going to do? Sit in the hairdressers!!! I enjoy watching  FX's 'Dexter.

Am very happy with first three weeks sales for 'Happy Deathday To You'. This is going to be a good weekend. Cannot believe how tired i am - and the government wants me to teach teenagers until I am 68. I'd like to see Michael Gove do what I do! I am now on Facebook. Let's be friends. Does the same apply to us - or do we only live longer if we are in a zoo too? http://t.co/Wlry54n How many Blue Peter items did you make when you were young? I think I'll stick to honey and lemmon, or maybe whisky. http://t.co/FDTljy0 If I wanted to be hot and sticky, i would cover myself in honey and throw myself on a barbecue. Things not to do in a heatwave: get in a car and drive to work. Guess what I'm going to do - yes, get in a car and drive to work. Why???? Cannot believe how beautiful it is today. Just back from a glorious walk around Frampton Marsh where we saw a graceful marsh harrier. Poor little thing. That's really sad. http://t.co/yjB4adc Vettel on pole again.

Thanks to those of you who have bought it. Would love to know what you thought. At least I know how to read a map! http://t.co/FMvfkEW An interesting article. http://t.co/IBoh6Hr. Myself, I never watch reality TV shows, only detectives! Tiring day in London. However, I can't really believe that after paying £100 for a train ticket, I had to stand all the way!! Lovely quiet day spent watching cricket and birds. Pity it is Monday tomorrow. We can't let this happen, can we? http://t.co/UQhII5g Promising start to sales of new book.

I can go to bed happy. A lazy day beckons. Garden, book and long cool drinks are the order of the day. @bbc_springwatch Have seen BBC news about red kites 'attacks'. Is this going to be the start of more bad press for this magnificent bird? Have spent a lovely day watching puffins. If you find all nine let me know - I can't. http://www.optillusions.com/dp/1-58.htm I can breathe a sigh of relief for now. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13594932 Nature never ceases to amaze me! This made me cringe. http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8757000/8757771.stm The Sky Art programme with Simon Russell-Beale and the Archbishop of Canterbury discussing Shakespeare was the best TV I've seen in ages! Both are equally important. How can a teacher give individual feedback in a class of 35? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13558209 A hug never hurt anyone, how ridiculous. We do live in a strange world.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13578044 I want a lemur! If it's good enough for Richard bBranson, it's good enough for me. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13502222 Well done 'The Killing' for scooping a BAFTA last night. @DetErlendur Totally agree with you. Have just read the review for RSC's 'Merchant of Venice' and am really looking forward to going to see it in August. I wonder who are the most content - we seem to be ruled by time. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13452711 @danwaddell Thanks for that - I'll get onto Amazon. @DetErlendur Thanks for that - I'll get onto Amazon. Why do weekdays get longer and weekends shorter? I'm sure that the weekend should start today! Have loved the Jo Nesbo novels, and the Wallender series. Which other Scandinavian author shall I now try? So sad! These are magnificent birds.http://www.ospreys.org.uk/category/osprey-team-blog/ True! We need more bookshops where we can sit. browse and buy. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13425666 Another beautiful day. Pity I have to work today. First draft of second Mike Malone Mystery is now complete. Phew! GCSEs start in England today. What will the pass rate be this year? 150%? It's about time we stopped dumbing down and spoon-feeding kids. Go and see 'Cardenio' in Stratford upon Avon - RSC. Very well done with some first class acting. The things people throw away! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-13395076 Loved the book, not sure how it will work as a film. I will keep an open mind. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13376536 Oh dear! I am a cat lover and a bird watcher. http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wondermonkey/2011/05/tiddles-law-should-we-restrict.shtml Stay out of the water! http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9477235.stm Interesting article on the power of a word. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13269302 I am sure that the mornings get earlier! Another 5000 words and first draft of Mike Malone 2 will be complete. Still need a title. Does anyone else find the title the hardest bit? If this is the case we need to stop global warming now! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13269302 Amazing pictures of a fantastic bird http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9469000/9469460.stm Feeling positive, second Mike Malone going really well. The pieces of the jigsaw are now dropping into place - he will soon solve the crime. @fiddlewifey It was the first time I have ever seen a fox 'up close and personal'. It was great! Who is going to solve this? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13211331 A lot of you will not find this exciting, but, a fox ran right by me today. Wow! Royal Wedding was fantastic - they looked so happy. Reminded me of my own wedding so many years ago. Beaten to death by a packet of Crunchy Nut breakfast cereal! This takes the phrase 'serial killer' to a whole new level. Where has the sun gone? If I could live anywhere, it would be in Venice overlooking the Grand Canal. Johnny Depp would be my neighbour and would pop in for coffee. Roll on the next Bank Holiday! Good night! A lovely day, let's see what tomorrow brings. Maybe this -  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13161054 I can't believe how beautiful and hot this weather is. Can anyone tell me what season we are in? I've got all confused. Lost! One voice! Extremely friendly and very affectionate. If found please return to me quickly, my husband is enjoying the peace too much. Why do my family want a hot meal on a hot day? The only place I want to cook today is on my sun lounger in the garden! If you see this - run for the hills! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13134505 Nearly twenty thousand words of second book completed. I know who the murderer is; I'll point Mike in the right direction soon. Lovely walk this morning watching ospreys, a red kite and a buzzard. Highlight was a kingfisher - beautiful. Back home now and ready to work About to listen to Greg Doran talking about 'Cardenio' on Radio 3. When I drag my son out of bed I am not being mean, I am making sure that he gets to where he needs to go. One day he will thank me. @lisamarie20010 I am doing. Going for a walk shortly. I love this time of year when everything is a vibrant green. Another beautiful day so what shall I do? The options are: write, walk, sunbathe. Decisions, decisions! A wonderful day for just walking and listening to the sounds of nature. I hope there are many more to come. The Killing v Spiral? I think I prefer the Danish integrity, although the severed head on the kitchen table was quite amusing. I want to play with dry ice? Can you buy it Iceland? Sunshine and ice-cream. What more could a girl wish for? What did men do before football? Read samples of 'The Woolly Murders': http://t.co/Mw4SkfN They say in England you can get all four seasons in one day - well, just a little sunshine now and then would be nice. @Robin_Spano Like, was I the only one to actually eat that? @Robin_Spano Mnn. Thank you for your insight. Perhaps being veggie is the 'not-so-scary' choice, like being a vegan... Sometimes I crave corned beef, fried in batter! What have I missed in being a vegetarian? Boys and their toys. My son is playing ice hockey on the road outside the house with a tennis ball. If it was snowing I could understand it! I can't find a single piece of chocolate in this house. Looks like hubby has been tidying up again! RT @RinSimpson: If you get 8 hours sleep a night for several nights, you shouldn't feel exhausted, right? #canihaveanapyet @KerryMurdock I can think of some men who...... Is it the caffeine in coffee that gives you the hit? That instant hit? Or the bitterness, the heat? Too much analysis spoils the experience. Weather: dull, overcast here. Warmer tomorrow and the weekend. Whatever the weather, I'll be writing and dreaming up characters. Another morning, another blank page... that was the old days. Now I can surf until I've got some ideas. @DavidBarb Thank you - a problem shared is a problem halved. Not sure how that would affect 'a killing' though! Thanks Tottenham Hotspur only have to score 6 in 30 minutes. So I am told. Does anyone know when 'The Killing II' starts? And can I wait? The saddest thing about modern education is the decline of 'the classics'. Whilst we must progress we must also preserve. @Petrona_ @eurocrime Thank you, or should I say 'tak!' Even went so far as trying to learn some Norwegian (Danish simply too hard to pronounce). Swedish might actually be more useful. At this moment in time I can't get enough of Scandinavian crime. 'He bent down to tie his shoe. At that very moment a shot whizzed over him. He threw himself into the mud and made eye contact with a duck.' Can't wait to see whether they discover anything new about Shakespeare.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-13040720 Have just watched 'Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest'. Scandanavian films are far superior to Hollywood glitz, glamour and gore. I think I may be too busy – I'm also working on a stand alone book as well. Obsession? There are worse things to be obsessed about. Read samples of Milly's book 'The Woolly Murders' http://wp.me/p1uG85-3 It's too early to get up, but unfortunately murderers do not stick to office hours. Now I have to solve this before I can have breakfast. After a wonderful day watching marsh harriers, I arrived home to find a second positive review of 'The Woolly Murders'. Brilliant day!! The sun is still out - beach here I come! What a beautiful weekend! What is the chance of it being followed by a beautiful week? Her heart was pounding as she opened the oven door. It was true - the cherries had all sunk to the bottom of the cake! Buzzards circling, sun shining, a perfect day! "The evidence points to Mr Frosty. Bring him in." "I can't, Sir. He's melted into the crowd." http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13010131 Make it so. I do know the difference between curlew and whimbrel - I'm just not telling you! The difference between a curlew and a whimbrel. Which reminds me, I need some sleep... Everyone loves tea these days, it seems. Well, there are worse things to get hooked on. The Woolly Murders (The Mike Malone Mysteries) by Milly Reynolds http://t.co/hhT08ul First review of my book. Thank you. As the adrenaline kicked in. she watched with pleasure as the knife slid easily in the soft flesh. As she twisted it, her laughter rang out. She could feel the crystal, cold against her skin, as she started the steady climb to the top of the Tor. The answer had to be there. Why does wind always have to howl? Doesn't it appreciate that some of us might need some beauty sleep? With my cat is asleep at the end of my bed, I know that for tonight at least I am protected. 'Dark shapes scudded across flat fields. A stark sheet of rain lashed in her face. She had to stop. In the water, a hand was reaching out..' Is it possible to OD on tea? You know when you've had one too many coffees - but tea? A glorious morning here, I can't speak for any where else! With the murder weapon in his possession, the final piece of the jigsaw fell into place. Have had such a nice birthday/Mother's Day that it is almost worth being another year older. Decided to treat myself to an afternoon watching avocets and great-crested grebes. Feeling really refreshed now and ready to write. Must suspend writing tonight as Peterborough United are on TV. Mind you, that in itself may be a horror show! Entertaining though. Happy April everyone! I've never had writer's block - it's just that a lot of the time I produce a load of gibberish! For a change I'm going to have a coffee with two sugars. If I had a boat, I'd push it out and set sail to... Reading 'The Snowman' - again. I always thought that life was like a bowl of cherries and now I find that it's like a bowl of frozen peas - an exciting new taste! 'she had to retire but still solved the case, the killer exposed by her girl friend posing as a man in a cafe where the conspiracy began.' As Scandinavian detective are very much in vogue, are there any Icelandic, Faroese or even Greenlandic detectives?:) Well, 'The Killing' may have finished for now but there's a new French sleuth to replace it - is that really possible, I wonder? As his grip on her tightened, she knew that her life was ending. With her final breath, she blew a kiss to the world. Typical that the weather picks up on a Monday, isn't it? Another weekend may have evaporated into inky blackness, but at least the Census return will show that I once existed. Death by stiletto! Shall I choose Jimmy Choo perhaps, or good old Hush Puppies? Well, 'The Killing' ended last night on BBC but I'm not sure if I'm any the wiser. Lots of loose ends, I feel. Ah, the second series... Dull overcast day, typical weekend! Ah well, more time to write I suppose and drink more tea. Must get some Earl Grey. Didn't anyone tell the birds that the clocks have changed? They could have had an extra hour sleeping instead of waking me! Excellent finale to #thekilling. Danish TV certainly beats our sensational TV @Sarah_Lund It's the jumper what did it! Chocolate biscuits are brilliant when you want to put some tasty tit-bits into a story. Working on second book this afternoon. Not easy since the cat keeps pestering me for food. If he's not careful I'll write him out of book! Well, I had so much chocolate last night I need a hair of the dog. Such a shame I can't save this stash for hubby! RT @Sarah_Lund: Remember to post your jumper pics using #thekilling #forbrydelsen     Sone superb knitwear already coming in. Today is T ... Chocolate was certainly the answer! I'll now be energised enough to be able to attack Mike tomorrow. He has no idea what I have in store! RT @danwaddell: The Band's second album. One of the best five ever made? A glass of drink and Up on Cripple Creek and all is well with t ... Mike has just texted me, saying he's fed up being stuck in the delicatessen... for three days! His way of saying 'get on with it!' I am told today used to be New Year's Day at one time. Certainly feels like it today. Unlike some of my gender, I actually like cricket, although I don't pretend to fully understand it. My comments are legendary... The blooming obvious: Shakespeare should not be compulsory. Not every child appreciates a literary genius. So, end of yet another week. Each one gets quicker, I'm sure; less time for me to write about Mike Malone. Still, there's always chocolate! One day after the Budget and I'm still confused. What was the point in it? These people don't understand 'skint'!!! They dragged the ditch expecting the worst: a head, two arms, a foot - from several bodies. Brad scratched his head and rolled a cigarette. Amber eyes shone out from under the parked car and she held her breath. A sudden lunge and she watched the blood drip onto her shirt. Looking forward to seeing 'Cardenio' at RSC soon. It's a bit of a hotch-potch, but the nearest we'll get to the 'original' play. Loved Liz Taylor, fabulous presence, beautiful, talented. If I had only one of these qualities I'd be satisfied :O 'She despaired at ever being able to learn Danish and decided to stick with the speech impediment.' 'She could do no wrong, he could do no right. A burning resentment grew until revenge revealed itself in a hundred wounds.' 'Each time the plastic smiles in photo albums, a bland disguise concealing the appalling truth that they would all, in time, disappear.' RT @Sarah_Lund: Now, I like Carsten's hair but I also like Bengt's. But which is better? There's only one way to find out... #thekilling ... Well, what a fab day to be out with my tickling stick and how's that for a pipe cleaner... Spring does funny things, n'est ce pas? Can anyone really drink 20 cups of tea a day? I saw someone who does yesterday. They must be at home... in the water-closet! So, finally, the Kindle edition of The Woolly Murders is out. Number 1: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woolly-Murders-Mike-Malone-Mysteries/dp/B004SYBDR8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=digital-text&qid=1300736598&sr=8-1 Last night's 'The Killing'. Why wasn't Meyer protected in hospital? Should have been. And Lund should have waited for him before going in. "Is this your wife?" I pulled back the sheet. He nodded. "Yes, that's Emily. Do you have her handbag? She has my car keys." He believed that nothing could shock him, that he was hardened to the horrors in the world around him. He was wrong. 'They used to believe the image of the murderer was etched on the retina of the victim. Too late, the eyes had already been ripped out...' 'Three names he wanted. He'd accounted for two. The third was illusive, in that some individual had removed it from the crime-board.' "Time of death?" "Between 5am and noon." Damn! It couldn't be Simpson - he was still being interviewed. I would have to release him. 'He took a slurp of tea, good strong tea, just as Horton walked into his office. He looked up again, Horton's face telling him everything.' Who really wants to teach these days, anyway? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12727379 The 'difficult' second book is proving just that: it's 'difficult' to find the time to write it! Drat! Exactly what drives our insatiable need for crime fiction? Does it stand up to scrutiny? So Mike Malone decamps to somewhere in the country. Sounds idyllic - not!!! No title yet but have completed first few chapters of Mike Malone number 2. He gets under my skin! Scandinavian crime fiction is wonderfully refreshing, free from the melodrama of some of our own. DI Mike Malone must drink fifteen mugs of tea a day. It fine hones the brain for super sleuthing..... Ordinary tea is good for you, as well as all the other fancy sorts. Just make sure you do more than show the bag to the water! Final reading - it's always surprising what little errors you find. Thanks Editor! When will Mike Malone give up his secrets to me? 'The Killing', how many more twists can their be? Fantastic show, wonderfully written, brilliantly acted. I'm loving it! Love the front cover! Mike Malone will soon be making his first appearance in public. There aren't many things nicer than a nice cup of tea - and a biscuit or three to dunk in it. The diet starts tomorrow. I'm thinking of taking up the cello once again. Either that or the viola - a much underestimated instrument, the viola. @Darkbeaver Don't give me that malarkey! I know that you do give a dam... Hi - final editing underway. The first book will be published soon.
