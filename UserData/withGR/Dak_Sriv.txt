Constant pursuit for something new. @Mona2237 Christmas* :-/ Frkn Typos @Mona2237 yes well. I usually delegate work.. so I've been out standing with my colleagues... drinking tea, discussing Christmast Kringle ;) @Mona2237 Your Office ended early !!!

Nighty-night! @Mona2237 1.5 hours later, it seems we're out of topics to speak about atm :P @Mona2237 &amp; women buy it sooner! Yes, I'll do that. *adds to wish list* Put In In In Dia! @Mona2237 Hmmm I just might buy it &amp; get it delivered to her.  "Woh kya hota hai?" Tsk tsk tsk. Very apathetic on their part. RT @Mona2237: @Dak_Sriv I got in a medical shop. Had to order it. You can try too. You know most of the chemists wale don't know what a pep‚Ä¶ @gratified_pal lol. Tell me on Insta too!!!!! :P @Mona2237 The answer to my question is, yes, its available. They don't know? üò®  They're the primary retailers! http://t.co/zG4XLgK73F @gratified_pal you've said that before PJ. Thanks though. Not tiring of hearing it. :P @gratified_pal :) @Mona2237 Hmm. Face it in the wrong direction &amp;  its a death wish come true. :-/  I wonder if it's available on Amazon or Flipkart. @gratified_pal I liked it.. Until the angel lost its powers &amp; became an orgy freak.  You just like the actors. Your insta speaks for you! :P @Mona2237 good. We're doing a secret Santa at work!! Can't wait to see what someone bought for me. Gonna have to wait until Christmas to find out though! @Mona2237 Okhay.. Ever had to use it? @gratified_pal 10? Wow. That shit is never ending! The shit I receive on whatsapp sometimes! http://t.co/NLnpdz6B32 @gratified_pal which season are we on now? @Mona2237 Yeah well. I hope I'm never at the receiving end of it. üòì @Mona2237 Yeah. Careful enough. üòì @Mona2237 That's good. I've been meaning to buy that for her since a while now. Slips my mind a minute after I think about it. @Mona2237 specially when you turn around and two aere gere log are following you. üò® @Mona2237 The other day I walked to a metro station. Most of the path was well lit, but I was genuinely scared for a brief period.. @Mona2237 specially from people who don't live in DLF/New Gurgaon.. Or who work in firms towards Manesar. A bit lonely there. @Mona2237 Not equally dangerous, but yes.. Not safe. I hear people being overpowered &amp; robbed of a car/phone/money all the time.. @Mona2237 Sick people can travel (uber).. But yes. Some places are safer than others. @Mona2237 The uber incident was a shocker. I've always assured my gf that it was a safe bet &amp; recommended it to so many people. *sigh* @Mona2237 but yeah. Delhi, soon after sundown... Its better to be in a safe environment with friends or family around. No plying. @Mona2237 I don't take that as an offense. Its the Ugly truth. Its not like stepping out alone will have a definite consequence.. @Mona2237 You and I have different opinions about Lucknow. :P  Its nice. I like Delhi more. Does taking my Kindle to read during my "daily routine" too makes me a compulsive reader? @Mona2237 Heh!  :) @Mona2237 Haila. Woh to bada pass hai. Lucknow. :D  Waise to Azamgargh.. But Lucknow now since no family member lives there anymore. @Mona2237 This multiple conversations at the same time brings back memories. With only one friend did I ever pull this off. @Mona2237 Yes well. That's based on how little you know me anyway. So.. Its okay! You're from UP too? Hi5! :P  Where in UP are you from? @Mona2237 Yeah. Its very tasty... A light hearted sweetness at the end of your meal! :)  Try it the next time you visit a patisserie. Visited GOSF website today. Cheap stuff available cheaper. Stuff start at INR 300. The deals on #Amazon ebooks were nice though. @Mona2237 hahaha no. I'm not a Punjabi. I'm a UP wala Bhayia. :P  Though, I'm a fan of non veggie like any Punjabi. üòç @Mona2237 Very palatable for anyone who likes coffee bitterness and not a fan of too much of sweetness in their desserts. @Mona2237 Lol. Okay. I'll give your same pinch when I meet her on Saturday. :P  Ask Google Now what Tiramisu is. RT @EconomicTimes: Kargil was in response to India's role in creation of Bangladesh: Musharraf - The Economic Times http://t.co/KNujaaEis3 @Mona2237 blasphemous tweets.. I say the same to my gf. She doesn't like sweets either. Anything sweeter than a Tiramisu is out. Russell Peters is coming to #Delhi. Tickets start from 2.5k to 5k. Thanks! But I'll YouTube the guy instead. üòê @Mona2237 üòê On an average, how many pages of a book do you read in a single day? Syllabus books don't count. #books #bookworm @Mona2237 Not really.. No* @Mona2237 Mmmmmmmm... Not really know. I do have a sweet tooth though. üòÄ @Mona2237 Heh.. So of its of any comparison, I ate a mug full of mung fali in office today. :P @Mona2237 oh. Okay. Well. Lets put a broader term to it.. Office culture. :P @Mona2237 Donuts!!!!! :D @Mona2237 Yep Yep. :) @Mona2237 I remember my first office party... I was like... "OMG so I can have anything I want... How much I want?" @Mona2237 Pizza party already? Haha that's good. You've officially been inducted in corporate world now! üôã @Mona2237 I noticed the formals part this afternoon... üòè RT @clintonjeff: Uhhh @Airtel_Presence this just popped up on my phone.
