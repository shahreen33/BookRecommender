Music cranking, white boards being installed. Good times! At Roosevelt Hotel, Mad46 Lounge for NYC Creative Good meetup Love watching the Tour de France. Great memories of being there last year. Go @lancearmstrong! #livestrong #tdf working in my home office, it's time to do some friday filing! up early, drinking tea, getting ready for yoga watching the maverick Dodgers. yum, just made some spicy sweet potato baked fries. installing the obama iphone application! Home from a 23 mile ride up Mandeville Canyon. Drinking a protein shake. @foodzie thank you, much appreciated! i just sent an email about the cookies. keep up the great customer service! Loving the beach today, it's 90+ degrees in Santa Monica. missing the cool nights with the ocean fog... When all else fails, reboot. Trying to motivate for a run. Ready for Obama to kick some butt. Cooking with chilies. Eyes are burning and watering. Already flushed with water twice. Good times. @bruinrob11 you racing? where is it at? happy friday! Looking forward to the debate tonight. I'll be watching on TV and reading election.twitter.com online. Mammogram at Santa Monica Breast Center. In and out in 20 minutes! It's almost breast cancer awareness month. Thinks there should be an "Update All" button on iPhone for app updates. One by one is too tedious. My second favorite team is now OSU (first is UCLA)! Pretty much only get the LA Times and NY Times for the crossword puzzles. There's nothing like doing the puzzle on newsprint. Looking forward to the season premier of Grey's Anatomy tonight! Beach run on the sand. Saying sorry to my legs in advance. Reading about (and fascinated by) CERN: http://bit.ly/4dqaQX Heading down to the Promenade to meet a friend for lunch at Real Food Daily. Yum. Trying to call official State of CA dept and voice prompt finally said: "Too many callers are waiting you must call back, good bye" - FAIL. must. eat. sushi. Going to yoga class. Nothing like a long nap on Saturday! Catching up on "Iconoclasts" episodes on Tivo. I love this show. The Tom Ford on Jeff Koons episode was fascinating. Finally watched Tina Fey/Amy Poehler as Palin/Clinton on SNL. Brilliant. Making chicken noodle soup. Loving my early Sunday morning with the Sunday LA Times and NY Times and a cup of tea. Anderson Cooper looks like a doofus reporting while standing in water up to his waist. @bruinrob11 9 minutes to go, down by 59 points. ugh. hope you're having a good weekend! Turned on (and then off) the UCLA game. Can't watch them getting killed. http://twitpic.com/bdae - Obligatory picture of me on Hicks St. in Brooklyn Heights. Doesn't think cab drivers should be allowed to talk on cell phones while driving. http://twitpic.com/b84c - Walking across Brooklyn Bridge. http://twitpic.com/b7jg - On the Brooklyn Promenade looking at Manhattan. Instead of "Do not disturb," the door knob sign at my hotel says "Don't even think about it." Walking on Hicks St. in Brooklyn. Feeling at home. Feeling like a NYer: Wearing tennis shoes but have office shoes in bag. In Brooklyn. Must sleep. Walking through the park heading to MOMA on a gorgeous day in NYC. Going to see August: Osage County at Music Box Theater on Broadway. In the modern art wing of the Metropolitan Museum. Happy! Start spreading the news, I‚Äôm leaving today. I want to be a part of it ‚Äì New York, New York. LAX =&gt; JFK. In NY for the week! The 11% NV voters that spoke to me: 50% unsure, others split even McCain & Obama. Pretty much a microcosm of the polls: http://bit.ly/4xobb1 Some fascinating stats from my calls to Nevada voters for Obama: 44% not home, 15% refused, 9% wrong #, 11% reached. Off to 6am yoga class and then to @BarackObama phone bank to call Nevada voters at 9am. Busy Sunday morning! Getting ready for a feast at Mastro's in Beverly Hills Just had a massage from a guy named Zolton. Only in the Peoples Republic of Santa Monica... http://twitpic.com/9rny - Tomato face at Santa Monica farmer's market Watching US Open and DNC. Sports and politics. Life is good. http://twitpic.com/8hkk - Cool barn on my ride this morning. http://twitpic.com/8hhc - Cool barn on my ride this morning. http://twitpic.com/8hg8 - Cool barn on my ride this morning. http://twitpic.com/8hcl - Cool barn on my ride this morning. Bluetooth headset didn't survive trip in washer AND dryer. Oops, guess putting in pocket was bad idea. Shit. http://twitpic.com/84ls - Homemade Poptarts! Going to get a deep tissue massage after a brutally tough week. I'm hoping it erases some of the week. Just watched "The Last Lecture" after finishing the book over the weekend. Incredible! Wow! http://tinyurl.com/2z3wsx eating chocolate covered espresso beans. yum. trying to motivate for my ride. thinking that i'll go get peet's coffee first. watching olympics cycling - men's road race. live commentary about weather: "it is a miserable day to race a bicycle." forgive me, twitter, for i have sinned, it has been 3 months since my last tweet... All dressed and ready for a bike ride but have a flat tire and don't want to change the tube right now. I think I'll run today instead. @andrewhyde "This is a marathon, not a sprint." My dog is being a picky eater. Waiting not so patiently for Grey's Anatomy. Turkish Embassy is in my building. Today is anniversary of Armenian genocide. Protest starting, our street is closing. Loving LA‚Äôs diver ... All coffee machines are out of service in our entire office. WTF? Productivity is spiraling. @robsnell Welcome to Twitter, nice to catch back up with you! Thanks for the Dummies shout out, I saw it! Drinking coffee before heading out for a trail run. @andrewhyde I agree! I think we can recycle them, not sure about exchange. Worth investigating. You win with 12+, I have 8! Tossing out my old Nalgene bottles. http://tinyurl.com/5x9jvx Looking forward to the Sunday Crossword but first a 50 mile ride. @andrewhyde a very belated congrats on the new gig. sounds awesome! @jduvall that's cool! although i have to say that i have mixed views on tech patents nowadays... Just ordered some insoles for some shoes. The insoles were more expensive than the shoes. Something is wrong. Doing my about weekly forced reboot of my Blackberry. Why does it always happen when I need to use it most? Finally doing my expense report. One receipt is almost 10 months old. Oops. 80+ degrees. What's not to love? Red, itchy, burning eyes today. Must be allergies or too much Excel. Eye drops are my friend. Went to a NCAA basketball site to find out time of women's national championship game tonight. No mention at all on first page. That sucks. Chocolate chip pancakes before a ride are a beautiful thing. Heading to Westwood for lunch. Go Bruins! Power Point is evil. I'm spending way too much time on formatting instead of content. That needs to change. Really need to do my taxes... Driving to San Diego for the weekend. Worked out with new bike coach this morning. Everything hurts. Just ate the worlds largest burrito for lunch. I'm not kidding. The new Yahoo! home page with the logo in the center seems like a waste of space. Going surfing! Researching new bide pedal options. Way too much time with Excel today. My eyes hurt. Getting ready to make my first ever souffle. My weekend is about to begin. YeeHaa! Poor USC. Not. Kind of have a feather thing going on with my hair today. Groovy. Lots of traffic today. On hold with State of California Franchise Tax Board. The hold music sucks. Whoever invented jasmine pearl green tea was thinking. beautiful day in Los Angeles, great views from the office to the ocean, downtown, hills. nothing like a little wind to blow out the smog. At the vet with Lola. At war with the ants in my kitchen. Bruins are giving me high blood pressure. Ahhh, 9 hours of sleep! Go Bruins! Roofers are at my house putting on a new roof, it's loud. forgot to change clocks, missed yoga class. oh well. Bruins are crazy lucky! Still happy about the Bruin game last night. Sat through 3 poorly formatted Powerpoint presentations today. Come on Bruins! I love it when I put on a pair of pants and find money in the pocket! Back from 25 mile ride, now the mad scramble to get to work. Loving the CNN mapping screen. Cooking some goodness - chicken mushroom marsala with sweet potato wedges. Yum. I am powerless over shopping on Amazon and my life has become full of books, fun gadgets, and other stuff. Walking my sweet dog. 9am conference calls on a Monday morning end the weekend quickly. Sigh. 40 mile ride. Check. Huge burger. Check. Chiropractor. Next. Nap. Soon. Ahhhh, meeting free for the rest of the day. Bring on the weekend! @jduvall I miss our afternoon chai breaks! Funny enough though, I had green tea today, too! :) Using GOOG spreadsheets for first time and finding it to be ultra annoying. eating oatmeal, trying to motivate for a bike ride The microwave at my office is the grossest thing ever, it wins the "dirtiest start-up microwave" award. coffee is my friend today. can't sleep. geez, i keep catching up to the live oscars with my tivo There's a double rainbow in P.S.! You know it's a deep massage when your masseuse tells you to take a pain reliever when you get home. counting the hours until I head out to Palm Springs for the weekend Lunar eclipse! Wow! Rain and LA drivers don't mix. my body is in a meeting, my mind is still in the weekend. wishing it was a 4-day weekend kind of embarrassed to admit that I like Fergie's "Big Girls Don't Cry" song... Helping my Aunt buy a new Mac. She's still using Eudora. Wowza. best thing about riding 32 miles this morning is the lunch I just got to eat. why is it that no matter how many times I do it I often try to put the USB plug in upside down? Riding my bike up Mandeville. At the Bob Dylan exhibit at the Skirball. Awesome! Scanning my blog reader, drinking coffee, heading to yoga soon. Getting ready to take Lola on a walk. It's almost nap time. Can't wait. Up way too early for a Saturday morning. In next to last meeting of the day. WooHoo! I sure do need this 3-day weekend, it's been a long week. Yawn... eating some Kashi cereal, getting ready to go to meet my trainer at the gym. I'm tempted to eat some conversation hearts but think I'll pass since they seem to taste like flavored chalk. Burrito for lunch at Chipotle in Beverly Center, this mall is ancient and it shows. Slept instead of working out, yesterday was a long day. Must have been wishful thinking about Lost last night! Hope my valentine wants t ... Good thing this plane has brakes, that was a rough landing! Back in LA, just in time to watch Lost. Airports in the U.S. are a mess... In security line at LAX, heading to OAK on SWA for the day. Line is moving fast. Nice! Just voted in my neighbor's garage! Nachos and Superbowl. Life is good. Easy like a Sunday morning... It's raining, heading to spin at YAS. Getting a burrito at Holy Guacamole and then eating it on the beach. Gotta love LA in February. It's Friday afternoon and I'm tired and needing a latte.
