I read them all so fast and like 5 years ago. Stayed up to finish my book (One Plus One by @jojomoyes). Probably going to somewhat regret it tomorrow when I am exhausted. C'est la vie... Why does Gibbs always have to be a hero? And of course McGee decided to help. Having to wait until fall to see the resolution sucks. #NCIS The only thing to say about that proposal is FINALLY. #densi #ncisla @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen I just discovered 2 Broke Girls. And naturally,  it was cancelled. So sad to see it go. Needed comedy in my week. @OfficialKat @BethBehrs When the power at the office is out and won't be back until 7pm... no work for me! #tgif Well, that is one hell of a cliff-hanger. Why do you do this to me, @crimminds_cbs? WHY?!? "I hate it when you go but I love when you walk away." Ain't that the truth. @Vangsness @shemarmoore #criminalminds Wait wait wait. @shemarmoore is only in the last 10 mins of this episode? Not enough but I guess I'll take it. #CriminalMinds It is going to be so interesting to see Reid come back from this whole prison thing. @GUBLERNATION @crimminds_cbs Oh man, Spencer was actually going to kill Kat. Prison really messed with his brain. @GUBLERNATION @crimminds_cbs In case anyone needs me, I'll be freaking out while watching the @crimminds_cbs season finale. This episode has just made me so happy. I love McGee and Gibbs' relationship. @SeanHMurray #NCIS Did Michelle really have to die? I'm looking at you NCIS:LA. Doesn't someone deserve to have a normal life? @llcoolj @chrisodonnell Just turned my weekday alarms back on. Broke my heart a bit. Not ready to go back to work tomorrow. So, why would this girl come back to set up Reid? Someone explain. #criminalminds @GUBLERNATION @JoeMantegna Rewatching earlier @BONESonFOX - 4:47 was when Booth and Bones finally got together &amp; their lives ultimately changed. I see you @harthanson When you drive by the Fox lot and get sad because @BONESonFOX no longer films there. 😭😫 @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz @TJThyne There truly will never be another show like @BONESonFOX.

Been watching for 8 years and have seen each episode countless times. 💀❤️ Saw Logan last night. Especially loved the Firefly nod during the Deadpool teaser. @VancityReynolds @NathanFillion I CANNOT HANDLE THIS!! Everyone has to be okay, right? Right?! 😭😭😭 @BONESonFOX The anticipation is killing me right now... @BONESonFOX I am definitely not emotionally or mentally prepared for the rollercoaster that will be these final two episodes of @BONESonFOX. 💀 It pains me to see Spencer in a prison jumpsuit. If anyone does not deserve to be there it's him. #criminalminds @GUBLERNATION @Vangsness There was definitely a collective "WTF" that was said by everyone in that theater and watching around the world. #oscars Queen @violadavis. 🙌🏽 #oscars I am way too excited to see @lin_manuel and the Moana performance. #oscars Absolutely loving watching all the stars jam out to @jtimberlake. #cantstopthefeeling #oscars No no no. Spencer cannot be remanded to federal custody. The team has got to clear his name. @GUBLERNATION @Vangsness #criminalminds Biggest takeaway from this episode of NCIS - where did they find floppy discs? @EmilyWickersham I will forever be annoyed that someone thought it was ok to make @ajcookofficial leave Criminal Minds. Thank goodness she came back. #reruns Congraulations @HodaKotb on the arrival of your baby girl. The announcement this morning made me so happy. 💕 "Welcome to NCIS - LA. We be cray." - Nell. There has never been a more accurate statement. 😂 @reneefsmith @llcoolj @DanielaRuah #ncisla Dear lord, this Reid storyline is going to be a doozy. I can feel it. @GUBLERNATION @Vangsness @pagetpaget @ajcookofficial #criminalminds I simultaneously want to give Reid a hug and a nice little Gibbs style swat on his head. He is so smart but can be so stupid. #criminalminds This episode is making me extremely anxious. I do not like seeing Reid or the team like this. @GUBLERNATION @Vangsness #criminalminds Dear @BONESonFOX, why would you completely break my heart on Valentine's Day?! Incredibly rude. 💔 Yassss! 🙌🏽 RT @netflix: This will be sweeter than Peeno Noir. @KimmySchmidt Season 3 arrives May 19. https://t.co/UWsh4ncH3p 6 week into 2017 and have already read 6 books.

That is all. #thegrammys Nothing good can come from Dinozzo Sr and the Sherlocks appearing in an episode together. However, hilarity will ensue. @NCIS_CBS How does @violadavis still look amazing with no makeup and in a prison jumpsuit?! Sometime the world is not fair. @shondarhimes #HTGAWM Turn on the tv &amp; it's Harry Potter weekend. I love young Hermione. @emmawatson Also, I miss @barackobama' voice during speeches. He could be giving some bad news but it would still sound okay. But really, why does the little orange man still have his twitter?! @TeamRizzles OMG!

Really really hope that it gets renewed. Cause that ending. 😮 That was a perfect Palmer episode. Loved seeing him talk about his family and share his great news! @BrianDietzen #NCIS Also, went to see Fences. Not quite an uplifting story for a birthday celebration but definitely see why @violadavis won the Golden Globe. When you eat way later than normal and way more that you have in weeks. Ooph.

Thank you for your service. 🇺🇸 #yeswecan #obamafarewell There aren't enough words to praise Meryl Streep. But @violadavis did a pretty damn good job. 👌🏼 #goldenglobes Oh man, this open. Bravo, @JimmyFallon. 😂👏🏼👏🏼 #goldenglobes Finally saw Moana. Everything was incredible. Especially the music. @Lin_Manual @TheRock So, kinda pissed that Bishop's new boyfriend was killed. If anyone deserved some happiness, it was her. @ncis_cbs @EmilyWickersham Love that Bones back. However, I still have a lot of questions about that serial killer arc. 💀👍🏼 @BONESonFOX Dropped off my parents @ LAX. Both ready to get back to my normal schedule but also sad that vacation is over and they had to leave. Happy New Years!

Another thing, I really hope this rain storm clear up by tomorrow. Only cause it will really screw with the already sucky LA traffic. Time to get back to real life after not having Monday obligations for two weeks. Not ready at all. So many empowering moments at this show. #stayweird #oscars2015 There are few words for what just happened - Lady Gaga just slayed those songs and the JULIE FREAKING ANDREWS. #oscars2015 RT @TeamRizzles: There is no heart emoji big enough to express my love for Julie Andrews I did not realize that Sound of Music was 50 years old. Amazing. #oscars2015 #myfavoritethings Let's just take a moment to appreciate that song and how many people were crying. Bravo. #Oscars2015 It's time for the 2015 Academy Awards. So exited for a great show from @ActuallyNPH #oscars2015 Universal truth: Jennifer Aniston is flawless. #Oscar #fashion #perfection The fact that today is the last of Glee filming is giving me all the feels.

Both 3XK and Dr. Nieman are back. #serialkillersareback Finally watched this week's episode of SVU. So upset that @adelsteinPaul was a skeevy rapist. He will forever be adorable Cooper to me.

That would be fantastic. #NCISNewOrleans @DianeNeal Do car chases, both real and fake, ever work out for the bad guy? I wanna say no... #NCISNewOrleans "The nerds are taking over." Great DiNozzo response to the team talking about Thor comics. #NCIS @M_Weatherly @EmilyWickersham @SeanHMurray Sometimes, when I figure out who the killer is before it is announced, I think to myself that I watch too much crime shows. Sometimes. And another one of my favorite episodes - when Ross, Rachel and Chandler try to get his couch up the stairs. #pivotpivotpivot #friends I can safely say that the episode of FRIENDS when everyone finds out about Chandler and Monica is my absolute favorite. 😂 😂 Time for the half-time show and a great performance by @katyperry. The only reason I'm actually watching the game. Well, that was one of the best National Anthems that I have ever heard.

They give you so much time to relax, but they also ruin you for the rest of the week. Despite being away from family &amp; my best friends, today has been a pretty nice birthday. Ready to see what this year brings me. 🎈🎉 #25 Birthday dinner 🎈🎉 #25 @ Rush Street http://t.co/4Zto8f6ucT Whoever decided to mash-up Alanis Morissette and Carole King is a freaking genius. @GLEEonFOX #JaggedLittleTapestry Also, even though I was lounging around, I still came away from all of that binge watching with a sore body. How does that work? And the biggest thing I came away with is that @JoeTheMorton is so incredibly good at playing evil Papa Pope. I would never ever cross him. In 5 days I caught up on all 57 episodes of Scandal. I can't decide whether to be proud or sad. Now I must wait 2 weeks for new episodes. Friday night in. http://t.co/1h7G42OOMu One thing that always blows me away when watching Shondaland shows is the insane monologues. I can't imagine memorizing those. @shondarhimes Finally pulled the trigger and started Scandal. Wondering why I waited this long. @shondarhimes You go, girl. JJ will not let the psychopath who tortured her win. She is too strong for that. @ajcookofficial @EWTV #CriminalMinds Reid and JJ are my favorite pair. @GUBLERNATION @ajcookofficial #CriminalMinds Bahahaha, I love that she just called Reid out. Genius or expert guesser? And that team dynamic. #CriminalMinds @GUBLERNATION @EWTV I get super happy when @DianeNeal guest stars on NCIS. This time she's in New Orleans. #NCISNOLA Sometimes it concerns me how quickly I can go through a carton of ice cream. Just sometimes. True life: the best part of that show was Tina and Amy's opening speech. #GoldenGlobes Tina and Amy just slayed that opening. 😂🙌#GoldenGlobes It's time! Excited for Tina and Amy to host. 🙌#GoldenGlobes I ❤️ packages from awesome people. http://t.co/KzjuRJpt7N Surprise surprise, @msleamichele's rendition of 'Let It Go' is perfect. @GleeonFox I love me some all male Acapella groups.

But a lot of really funny things happen. #NCIS First new NCIS of the new year. So exited to meet Gibbs' ex-wife number 1. Things will definitely get interesting. Caught up on Glee in time for the sixth (and final) season of the show. Ready for some great new numbers. Once a gleek, always a gleek. That was a great ending scene. I would love to join in some group zen. @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah @BarrettFoa @reneefsmith #oohm #NCISLA Yea, totally called that the red-headed woman was on the bad side.

Bahahaha, I actually giggled out loud during that joke. 🐸 @BrianDietzen #NCIS Why is Deeks always the one who plays a homeless person? I mean he does pull it off very well. @ericcolsen #NCISLA #hobochic Watching last night's episode of #NCISLA is so much more exciting since I saw some of it being filmed back in August. #locationvisit @RizzoliIslesTNT Her half-sister, Cailin. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia First full day of group sessions with the kids. So incredibly nervous right now. 😁 #internlife #sowk 🍨 #fundayfood http://t.co/IXkqRkIIxw Watching season 1 episode of Gilmore Girls and who do I see? The one and only @janemarielynch as a hospital nurse. #gueststars Dinner problems - first the line was too long at Chipotle then I didn't get my chick-fil-a sauce. #failonfail #firstworldprobs Let the bingeing begin. ☕️👭 #GilmoreGirls #oywiththepoodles http://t.co/oAu5ZCtJoL Now that it's done, I'll be honest. I was expecting the conspiracy to be headed by someone more menacing. #Bones @BONESonFOX @David_Boreanaz #RIPSweets @JohnFDaley RT @BONESonFOX: Goodbye, Sweets. You will be missed.   #bones I am going to miss Sweets. He made psychology cool. And he was such a lovable dork. #RIPSweets @JohnFDaley @BONESonFOX "She's always right when she speaks" Amen Booth, amen. #Bones @David_Boreanaz @emilydeschanel  @BONESonFOX RT @BONESonFOX: "You're a good man Booth. Don't let them take that away, because that really will be the death of you." - Brennan #bones I am so proud of Sweets. He gave his attacker hell. #Bones #RIPSweets @BONESonFOX @JohnFDaley I am not ready to say goodbye. This episode is going to be heartbreaking. #Bones @BONESonFOX @JohnFDaley #RIPSweets Another reason I am loving #MysteriesofLaura, besides the obvious (@debramessing being awesome), is @joshlucas on my tv every week. #hotcops It's my #WCW on NBC tonight - first @debramessing on Mysteries of Laura then @Mariska on SVU. 🔫#badasscopladies #nypdsfinest Today - first day of October, Hump Day, Gilmore Girls is on Netflix and season 10 of Criminal Minds starts. Too much good stuff! 👍🎃🍂☕️🔫 I love that Dinozzo called POTUS a wise-ass. It would only happen to him. @M_Weatherly #NCIS Finally watched the premiere of #Castle. Left with so many questions &amp; concerns. Bravo on a great episode. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic Had my first blended coffee from Coffee Bean the other day and now I'm hooked. Really want another right now. ☕️ #coffeecoffeecoffee Something that will forever baffle me: the lighting in the season4 finale of Castle. In all the big scenes it looks like sunrise or sunset. Finally watching #NCISLA season 6 premiere. First thought - Kensi just head butted the DEA agent, badass. @DanielaRuah @mercedesmason Being a responsible grad student means not staying up late to watch my fave shows season premieres. Thank god for DVR. 📺 #Castle #NCISLA Reading through cast tweets about the season premiere of #Castle and #NCISLA is making this whole west coast viewing thing super hard. It's 11:30 on a Friday &amp; I'm annoyed by a neighbor's loud music. Feel like a curmudgeon but after a long week I just want a good sleep.  👵 Dear @shondarhimes, You have done it again. How To Get Away With Murder was fantastic. I am ready for more. 🙌 👏 #HTGAWM #shondaland I was not emotionally prepared for that ending, what so ever. I am still having trouble breathing. @BONESonFOX #season10 #Bonespremiere All. The. Effing. Feels. Why did this have to happen? 🙊😩😭 @BONESonFOX #season10 #Bonespremiere Hodgins is the ultimate conspiracy nut. Of course he was prepared for this. @TJThyne @BONESonFOX #season10 #Bonespremiere Just how far does this conspiracy go? It never ends. @BONESonFOX #season10 #premiere If I ever needed love advice, I would definitely go to Angela. She is the wise one. @michaelaconlin @BONESonFOX #season10 #premiere I feel like a FBI agent should know that he can't trail another agent/trained sniper. I mean really. @BONESonFOX #season10 #premiere Premiere night - got the essentials. 💀🍷🍨  #Bones http://t.co/jA8Tmaj8WJ Dude, can I move into Booth &amp; Brennan's home? It is so freaking nice. Bravo to all the depts involved. 🏡👏 @BONESonFOX  #newseason #newhome I really like Brennan blackmailing. She may be new, but she's good. @emilydeschanel @BONESonFOX #season10 @TeamRizzles Give me an hour. And I will be there with you. At least on the Bones front. :) Booth in orange, yikes. But that scruff does look good on him. @David_Boreanaz @BONESonFOX It's finally time. Deep breaths to prepare for the inevitable intensity. @BONESonFOX @David_Boreanaz @emilydeschanel #season10 #premiere I forgot just how intense the finale was. I am literally under of how I'll get through this premiere. 💀🔫💣 @BONESonFOX #season10 Prepping for the @BONESonFOX premiere by watching last season's finale. Based on live-tweets from the east coast viewing, I'm not ready. 5 hours to finish a paper and workout before the season premiere of @BONESonFOX! Eeek, I'm so pumped. 💀👍🎉 @David_Boreanaz @emilydeschanel In it's 16th season, Benson is finally getting a slice of happiness. Excited to see how this changes her. 👶#babyBenson @Mariska @nbcsvu Kinda liking this new detective. But that stache needs to go, it creeps me out. @Mariska @nbcsvu #newseason #newteam So, Amaro is looking really nice in his police uniform. 👮 @TheDannyPino @nbcsvu Dun dun. @nbcsvu is back. #babyBenson @Mariska Gonna try out NCIS: New Orleans now. Let's see how the second spin-off goes. #NCIS #southernteam I am so happy that this team is back in my life. I have missed them immensely. @M_Weatherly @SeanHMurray @EmilyWickersham @PauleyP #NCIS Wait, what the eff? This crazy Russian was connected to Ari. This does not bode well for the future of this NCIS team. Yikes. #NCIS Oh my god, Gibbs really just cauterized Kevin's wound with his knife. Case rested, he is the ultimate McGyver. #NCIS #twentyklicks Seriously, Gibbs and that compass/leaf trick was super cool. @SeanHMurray #NCIS #premiere #twentyklicks I'm not sure how I feel about this Kevin guy. Something isn't quite right. Wonder what Gibbs' gut is telling him. #NCIS #twentyklicks In the hypothetical situation that I am stuck on an island, clearly I would want Gibbs there with me.  #NCIS It's finally time. The NCIS season 12 premiere is on. @SeanHMurray @M_Weatherly @EmilyWickersham @BrianDietzen "Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So... get on your way."

"And on a school night no less" 😂😂😂😂 I do not know how Jane stood there while Maura's boyfriend walked around in a kimono.

I'm not sure how I'm gonna get through next week's episode. @RizzoliIslesTNT #RIPLTY .@RizzoliIslesTNT is the funniest crime show that I watch. And I watch many. It's due to great writers and great actors. Finally watching the @RizzoliIslesTNT season 5 premiere. So, let's be real, nothing good happens when you go running alone at night. There is 1 hour until the s5 premiere of @RizzoliIslesTNT on the east coast, but I'm over here on the west. Having to wait will kill me. Signed a lease at an amazing, over the top apartment complex.

I cannot wait to see what the next season will bring! @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz @BONESonFOX Holy crap. For future reference, no one should mess with Booth. He will take you out. @David_Boreanaz @BONESonFOX #seasonfinale Booth going all McGyver and booby trapping his house, super hot. Makes me so anxious. #seasonfinale @David_Boreanaz @BONESonFOX Wow, this Senator Hadley guy is an ass. I do not like this case at all. #seasonfinale @David_Boreanaz  @BONESonFOX Thoroughly enjoyed Brennan changing "assailant" to "bastard". This case doesn't warrant niceties. #seasonfinale @BONESonFOX  @emilydeschanel Knowing things are going to go bad and this whole conspiracy case are making me super anxious. #seasonfinale @BONESonFOX I am a little bit obsessed with him. ❤️🐶 http://t.co/riSA9SRYHk Some of the kids attached to me this morning. #childcareprobs http://t.co/UCe8tBElVO Wahooooo. ❤️👌🎉 RT @ElizabethBanks: 365 days until @PitchPerfect 2 is released!! http://t.co/k4MpcFeJgk Thank you Criminal Minds for an excellent season and epic finale. @shemarmoore @ajcookofficial @GUBLERNATION @Vangsness @JoeMantegna Of course this ending fight/shoot-out has to be in the dead of night. They couldn't  possibly have it during daylight. #CriminalMinds Garcia actually just shot someone. And her reaction after, so her. @Vangsness #CriminalMinds It is super weird seeing @MichaelTrucco as the unsub in these episodes. He is still Det. Demming to me.  #CriminalMinds I think there is a special place in hell for pimp preachers who think it's smart to shoot at the BAU team. @shemarmoore #CriminalMinds Oh my gosh. Starting part 2 of this epic finale. Not sure I am emotionally ready for it. @ajcookofficial @GUBLERNATION #CriminalMinds Unhappy that NCIS:LA has moved to Monday nights. I will have to decide between that and Castle. Hard choice. #tvaddictprobs #fallschedule Yikes, Callen and Sam stuck on a submarine. Not good at all. @chrisodonnell @llcoolj #NCISLA The fact that the DEA agent thought that Kensi would be "Barbie's Malibu cousin". Dying. @DanielaRuah @MercedesMasohn @ericcolsen #NCISLA I am worried about Hetty, though she said to leave that for the enemy... @reneefsmith #NCISLA Sam seriously just picked up a thrown hand grenade and threw it back at the bad guys. @llcoolj #NCISLA Gibbs seriously just killed someone by crushing them with a car. Only him. #NCIS Why is @M_Weatherly such a beautiful man?? And the way he wears a suit, swoon. 😍👌 #NCIS But really, is it too much to just let them have their happily ever after? @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic @tamalajones #CaskettAlways I guess they had to have a very Castle-centric cliffhanger since the others were all Beckett... @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic  #CaskettAlways The fact that we have to wait all summer to find out what happened to Castle. Not a happy camper. 😫😠 @NathanFillion #CaskettAlways No no no. They cannot end that episode like that. How long before they get their happy ending? @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic #CaskettAlways Ugh, it is precious that Martha gave Kate those beautiful earrings. @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion #Castle Only in their relationship and wedding would everything that could go wrong happen. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic #CaskettAlways Well that wasn't expected. And Kate's reaction, perfect. 👌 @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion @EddieMcClintock #Castle The fact that Ryan typed a 'LOL' with her husband's address. @seamusdever @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion #Castle This week's case: Beckett finding her husband and getting a divorce. Not so typical for this group. @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion #Castle Beckett's married and she did it at a drive thru chapel in Vegas. That makes me giggle. @Stana_Katic #Castle It's time for the Castle finale!! I will be live tweeting. Sorry not sorry. #CaskettAlways 👰💏 @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion I am loving Sweets working as the lead agent. @JohnFDaley @emilydeschanel @BONESonFOX More canvases. 🎨 #artsy http://t.co/EQkmX6egRa Back to the regular work/internship schedule tomorrow.

She's a feisty little firecracker. #NCISLA @reneefsmith I absolutely love how Bishop has become part of the team &amp; I am so excited that she's the new probie. #NCIS @EmilyWickersham @M_Weatherly So excited for this brand new NCIS &amp; I am so intrigued to learn about how much Bishop really knows about Parsa. @EmilyWickersham The cuteness that is Beckett &amp; Castle is just too perfect. And she said yes to the dress. 👫💏👰❤️ #Caskett @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion Dinner with the cousin. ❤️👯 http://t.co/igV54NC7qf Just had a FaceTime convo with @KellyFerree for 1hr43min.

That makes me feel old. That was my jam in middle school. #throwbacktune True life: I constantly want chips and guac. #omnomnom One of my fav parts of award show performances is watching all of the celebrities straight jamming. #grammys Where can I go to learn to do aerial trapeze like what @Pink does? It is so freaking cool. #grammys I am completely obsessed with this @katyperry song, Dark Horse. And this performance is awesome. #grammys It's time for the Grammy's and kicking it off with queen @Beyonce. #drunkinlove Just read John Green's 'The Fault in Our Stars'. What a lovely story. I hope the movie does it justice. I cannot believe we have to wait until April 1 for new Mindy Project. That winter finale was, wow. @mindykaling Snow day fun with this girl. ❄️❄️❄️ #snowgram #latergram http://t.co/lAGkISgwOV @RizzoliIslesTNT He's a plumber. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia Doing an anti-snow dance in hopes that it won't start until I'm already up in Maryland. I just want to be able to see @Kwiderman. I love seeing more of Alexis in this episode. And that scene of her ranting about her life. 👍👌 @MollyQuinn93 #Castle I am excited for snow but if it messes with my plans to see @Kwiderman I will be seriously pissed.  ❄️❄️❄️ Team Spice Girl at cosmic bowling. #birthdayfun http://t.co/JD3WBPe4e5 My family spoiled me with such great things. 🎁🎉 #birthdaypresents http://t.co/VfkMcPtADy Holiday goodies from kferree10, weeee. http://t.co/8cU04vtHx0 Throwback to last week when I was here. ☀️🌴 #tbt #paradise http://t.co/hOnSdnOij6 Pentatonix + Frozen = perfection. popdust - http://t.co/dJxsBXH7sD Somehow tonight's episode of SVU was already online.

Is there anything she doesn't know? @ericcolsen @chrisodonnell @llcoolj  #NCISLA "When it comes to growing there is no better place for a desk than next to these three." Perfect advice from Cranston to Bishop. ⚓️ #NCIS Bishop's thoughts about cheese puff's quality as support to the linkages between information. Basically perfect.👌🙌 @EmilyWickersham #NCIS RT @eonline: Only Matthew McConaughey starts his #GoldenGlobes acceptance speech with "all right, all right, all riiight!" Incredibly happy that Frozen won best animated movie. ❄️⛄️ #GoldenGlobes Tina &amp; Amy's opening was right on point. 👌👍🙌 #GoldenGlobes Paradise ☀️🌴🌊👙 (Turks &amp; Caicos) http://t.co/gXlrFC1Ijf Leaving this cold weather behind for a week in sunny Turks and Caicos.

In a train wreck type way, you can't help but stare. #NCIS He is seriously the cutest. ❤️🐶 http://t.co/flWM9rMl0l Watching season 2 episodes of #Bones and saw that @JanetTamaro was a producer. Why did it make me so excited? #crimeshowoverlap It's so fluffy!! TJ Maxx find. http://t.co/FqshILRnIS Seeing Frozen today. Very fitting with this weather. ❄️⛄️ #snowsnowsnow #imachild Saturday night in - Bones on Netflix and Chick-Fil-A for dinner. 👍👌🙌 Holy cow, Cam punching her identity thief. You go girl. 👊👏 #Bones @tamarataylor Brand new #Bones. Super excited for guest, @McKaylaMaroney. What could be better than an Olympic gymnast &amp; a murder mystery? @David_Boreanaz .@carrieunderwood and @AudraEqualityMc singing 'My Favorite Things'.

Not sure why but not complaining. @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz Happy Hannukah to me. My first Alex and Ani bracelets. http://t.co/j9ORY2iIac Happy Thanksgivukkah. 🍗 #gobbletov @RizzoliIslesTNT MEND - medical network of doctors. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia Still trying to figure out the end game of Densi being separated. Cause there has to be one. #NCISLA #itsalovestory @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah They can't be split up right as things are moving forward. It's just not fair. 💔 #itsalovestory #Densi #NCISLA @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah I was not expecting that punch from Kensi. Yikes. That looked liked it hurt. 👊❤️ #itsalovestory #Densi #NCISLA @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen Two minutes in an things are already awkward.  #itsalovestory #Densi #NCISLA @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah The fact that Beckett and Castle almost kissed while standing in a dumpster. ❤️💋 #itslove #Castle @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic Burn by @elliegoulding 🔥🎤 #np #currentjam http://t.co/ClNHhs1FO3 "Set out each day believing in your dreams.

It is Saturday night and I am home &amp; in bed before my mom. What is wrong with this picture? 👵 #oldladystus I'm glad that my dog doesn't judge me when I laugh out loud whilst I watch my shows alone. 🐶📺 @KeithUrban "Every beat, every line, every word, every single time..." 🎤🎶 #wewereus #lightthefuse Catching Fire!!!! Let the Quarter Quell begin and may the odds be ever in your favor. @melissaaaa #girlonfire #hungergames Typical. #besties #tbt http://t.co/DYudB9QU15 @RizzoliIslesTNT His informant was Patty Doyle, Maura's father. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia Really, really liked @EmilyWickersham as NSA analyst Bishop. She was the perfect amount of awkward that the team needs. #NCIS I am simultaneously happy for Densi in taking the next step and nervous for what happens next. ❤👫🔫#NCISLA @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen Last night's #Castle was insanely creepy. And clearly the whole thing isn't over. @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion @tamalajones @Jon_Huertas Sometimes all I can think of when I watch #Bones is that I want Angela's wardrobe. After I get over the gross factor, obvi. @michaelaconlin Is it just me or have the Cheerios gotten bitchier over the years? This Bree chick is just awful. #Glee This rendition of "If I Were a Boy" by Unique. Amazing and heartbreaking. @ANew92 #Glee Even @matt_morrison and the Gleeks can't make me like "Blurred Lines" again. I'm just so over that song. #Glee @RizzoliIslesTNT Tommy gives the interview. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia Season 1 episodes of NCIS:LA on USA. Don't like them as much because of all the Dom stuff and there is no Deeks. @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah I wish I didn't have to wait a whole week for the next big Densi moment. That promo was such a tease. @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah ❤️👫#NCISLA Yay yay yay! 🔫&amp;💉 RT @RizzoliIslesTNT: THIS JUST IN: Season 4 of #RizzoliandIsles will return Feb. 25, 2014 at 9/8c on TNT! The fact that Hodgins is growing an insect I'm his neck is absolutely nasty. 😝😷 #kingofthelab @TJThyne @BONESonFOX My morning coffee has worn off. I am in serious need of some caffeine right now. The conversation I've been having with my faves &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 👌👌👌@Amanda_Rae2014 @Kwiderman @LizzyJaneDavis I really need to stop snacking right before bed. But first I need to finish all the snacks... Too bad it would be inappropriate for Sam to walk around shirtless all the time... @chordoverstreet #Glee It's Gaga vs Katy tonight on #Glee. And @ddlovato is back. 🎵🎶🎤 This audition by @carlyrosemusic is a little reminiscent of her audition for X-Factor. Well played. #SVU #americandiva Time for an all new #CriminalMinds directed by the one &amp; only @GUBLERNATION. That means it will be a little bit weird &amp; a whole lotta good. .@TayeDiggs makes anything sound sexy. Evidence is him repeating 'rubber, baby, buggy, bumpers' in last night's #NewGirl. @ZooeyDeschanel Happy Birthday little seester. 🎉🎁🎂❤️ nikkid102 http://t.co/BR6TxSRX3T Gibbs and Fornell is my favorite bromance but after them it's definitely Dinozzo and McGee. @M_Weatherly @SeanHMurray #NCIS Advanced screening tickets bought. Countdown to the Quarter Quell can commence. #hungergames… http://t.co/g61qOBDf06 Fall colors. 🍁🍂 http://t.co/rAKSiEmxsw I derive too much joy from making my own mean, even if it is just pasta and microwave-steamed sugar snap peas. #nomz 🍝 Homecoming with my faves. #jmudukes 💛💜🏈 http://t.co/10kJQutu7h RT @happyydazee: "You can't deny that going to hogwarts would be life changing" Margo, Edith &amp; Agnes #despicableme @AmandaRLeizear @happyydazee http://t.co/oVpexwTANH In honor of Homecoming weekend. #tbt #jmudukes 💜💛🏈 http://t.co/SCHFJguxVG Costumes through the years - superwoman, Spice Girls, Pink Ladies, Smirnoff Ice. #halloween #tbt… http://t.co/4XfrYhRWUM Nice little Rizzoli and Isles shoutout during #CSI. @JaneRizzoli @MauraIsles @Angie_Harmon @SashaAlexander1 @LolitoMejia I may have had a 3rd at home... I may or may not have eaten 3 pieces of cheese cake today... 🍰🍰🍰 #nomz @RizzoliIslesTNT His name is Joe Friday. 🐶 #RizzoliandIsles #trivia Gosh, I love when NCIS works with the Coast Guard cause that means Agent Borin is around. ⚓️ #NCIS @DianeNeal @PauleyP @M_Weatherly So, when are Kensi &amp; Deeks going to discuss that kiss they shared?? There's an elephant in the room... 🐘@ericcolsen @DanielaRuah #NCISLA Gotta say, I really dislike this Alexis. She needs to stop being silly. Why would you be awful Castle?! @MollyQuinn93 @NathanFillion This episode is so much like 'National Treasure' and I love it. #Castle @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic All of Castle's fencing practice with Alexis finally paid off. @NathanFillion @MollyQuinn93 #Castle Instead of working on my grad school essays I am watching old episodes of NCIS:LA. #sundayfunday #procrastination Just bought tickets to see @idinamenzel in 'If/Then' here in DC. She is my favorite. Let the countdown commence. #newmusical #broadwaybaby Cause she's queen Beyy. @beyonce 👑🐝  http://t.co/xMOy5jbwER My favorite part about fall - the changing leaves. 🍁🍂👍 My least favorite part about fall - the fact it gets so dark so early. 🌜⭐️👎 All of the Spanish being spoken in this episode &gt;&gt;&gt; #ayeayeaye #muycaliente #EnriqueTrouble #SVU @TheDannyPino @RaulEEsparza Sometimes I question where I get random bruises. Then I do things like run into a door handle. #suchaklutz That was a great episode. Kinda sad that Catherine only showed up flashbacks though. And what a great montage at the end. #CSI300 These are a few of my favorite things - show on the tv &amp; dog in my lap. 📺🐶 http://t.co/Zov61DGyKS Time for a monumental episode from @CSI_CBS. I am most excited for @MargHelgen #CSI300 "Life's a dream. Realize it." - Mother Theresa. They pick the best quotes. #CriminalMinds Penelope is so badass. Only she could find all this information in a hospital waiting room. @Vangsness #CriminalMinds Only Reid would read 'The Magical Mathematics of Quantum Physics' to help when he's anxious... @GUBLERNATION @shemarmoore #specialagentnerd @RizzoliIslesTNT Hope is a doctor. #RizzoliandIsles #trivia I think I giggled just like Kensi did when Deeks asked Hetty to give him some sugar. 👏 #NCISLA @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah "It's like America and France made slow, sweet love and then had a pastry baby." -Deeks ericcolsen… http://t.co/v1wlO421kf The team looks so badass with their vests and the other gear. #NCISLA @chrisodonnell @llcoolj @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah Poor Nell being called a ginger bitch by an old man. #NCISLA @reneefsmith Hetty and her Jedi mind tricks on Deeks. 👍 #NCISLA @ericcolsen Just had part of a bread pudding muffin thing from Donna Bell's Bakery. In a word, delicious. @PauleyP Goodbye NYC. As always, it had been a blast. Until next time. ❤️🗽 http://t.co/zIAKoLh2m2 That was such a classic episode of #Castle. I mean time travel? Right up his crazy theory isle. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic Those were some great vows. Especially Bones'. @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz @BONESonFOX #BonesWedding #Bones "We're all mad here..." Alice in Wonderland I'm Central Park #nyc http://t.co/LgNIXeh5Wf Live with Kelly and Michael (with guests Ted Danson and Jennifer Morrison) #nyc http://t.co/BMQsqLp5P8 Time for @KellyandMichael!! Ready for some fun with @KellyRipa and @michaelstrahan. #nyc Seeing @CinderellaBway. It's going to be a magical night. 🌟👡 #broadway #musicals @KellyFerree Do it!! @KellyFerree I am going up to NYC for a long weekend. And I could totally take a bigger suitcase and just stick you in there. And I am definitely developing a bruise where I punched myself in the knee during a Zumba dance. I totally should've packed earlier. Cause right now, after two fitness classes, all I want to do is curl up in bed... I am totally intrigued by this relationship between JJ and the new section chief. @ajcookofficial #CriminalMinds Congrats to the cast&amp;crew on reaching this milestone. @chrisodonnell @llcoolj @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah @BarrettFoa @reneefsmith #NCISLA100 Callen going all lone wolf cannot end well. Though we know that the rest of the team will somehow come to back him up. #NCISLA100 Is anyone really surprised that Callen followed them to the crime scene? You can't keep him away from a case. @chrisodonnell #NCISLA100 Little late to the party but ready for some fun. 🎉@chrisodonnell @llcoolj @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah @reneefsmith @BarrettFoa #NCISLA100 I would love to see Gibbs playing Twister. #NCIS Watching NCIS:LA cast on @TheTalk_CBS. That was kinda the most badass entrance. @chrisodonnell @llcoolj @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah This is actually the craziest hostage situation I have ever seen on a cop show. And I've seen my fair share. #Castle @NathanFillion It must be very difficult for Kate Beckett to not have a job and watch her fiancée walk into a hostage situation. @Stana_Katic #Castle Friends playing Heads Up. With one via FaceTime. @theellenshow http://t.co/43MNK0VTwb This episode was a beautiful tribute to Finn and the joy that he provided. He is a character who will be truly missed. #goodbyeFinn #Glee @eHen10 Totally watched it already. This performance of Make You Feel My Love by @msleamichele is the most raw and heartbreaking one I've ever seen. 💔 #RIP #goodbyeFinn #Glee Tonight we say goodbye to Finn Hudson. #RIPFinn #Glee http://t.co/jCLIs5ELhE Not even 30 seconds in and I'm already crying. This episode is going to be a doozy. #hardestwordtosay #goodbyeFinn #RIP #Glee Maybe I should've added "spoiler alert" to my last tweet but I was too excited about the end. 💀@BONESonFOX @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz The nightmare of Pelant is over. Finally. @BONESonFOX @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz @TJThyne @michaelaconlin @JohnFDaley I agree with Booth, it will do no one good to catch Pelant alive. He needs to die. #stopPelant @BONESonFOX @David_Boreanaz I really hope that this is the last episode I ever see Pelant. @BONESonFOX @emilydeschanel @David_Boreanaz Thank goodness I have a week to emotionally prepare myself. #goodbyeFinn #Glee I am going to be bawling during the entirety of next week's episode. I cannot believe we will be saying goodbye to Finn. #hardestwordtosay "Let It Be" is probably my favorite Beatles song and this cover is absolutely wonderful. #Glee #Gleetlemania Really excited for @ddlovato on Glee right now. And her character share my name. @RizzoliIslesTNT She doesn't like to be hugged. #trivia And I do not feel satisfied with the resolution of the Tiva back &amp; forth. I wanted so much more. @M_Weatherly #NCIS #goodbyeZiva That was the most heartbreaking ending. I can't believe that Ziva will no longer be part of this team. I'll miss that badass ninja. 💔 #NCIS Burying my feelings over tonight's emotional episode with a plethora of Chick-Fil-A. And of course some chocolate. @M_Weatherly  #NCIS #TIVA Cam pulling the face off of that woman's skull was really gross &amp; Brennan saying great was classic. @TamaraTaylor @emilydeschanel #Bones I have a hunch that Beckett isn't going to like all of this grey area in DC. She'll be going back to the NYPD soon. @Stana_Katic #Castle Nice "Wizard of Oz" reference. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic #notinKansasanymore #Castle Of course Beckett goes the Secretary's house to harass him. She's a badass rule-breaker. @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion #Castle This case is so much bigger than anyone though. But that's what happens when you're a federal agent. @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion #Castle I'm not anxious about Beckett finding the antidote cause Castle can't die so I'm just gonna enjoy how badass she's gonna be. @Stana_Katic I'm not anxious about Beckett finding the antidote cause Castle can't die so I'm just gonna enjoy how badass she's gonna be. @NathanFillion Yes yes yes!!! RT @TVGuide: Prentiss is back! @pagetpaget is returning to #CriminalMinds for the 200th episode http://t.co/I2T2jHvzxk Live &amp; Loud tour. #rascalflatts #bandperry @ehen10 http://t.co/ZoNSEGVbow Re-watching Private Practice. On the season 3 finale. Having the same anxiety the first time. Why did Dell have to die? 💔 @mrchrislowell Such a great time seeing @TheBandPerry and @rascalflatts. Reminds me just how much I love country concerts. 😃🎤❤️ #wmzqfallfest Bless the Broken Road. Rascal Flatts. http://t.co/DbiL3cP1Kg Better Dig Two. @thebandperry http://t.co/01ufMmD2ae That was the perfect Glee proposal. Partly cause they are the perfect couple. @DarrenCriss @chriscolfer #Klaine #Glee And season 5 starts with a new couple. Kitty + Artie = Kartie. @becbecbobec @druidDUDE  #Glee I really love Blaine and his bow ties. @DarrenCriss #Glee #Gleetlemania Wearing my Cheerios tshirt cause tonight is the season 5 premiere of Glee. #Gleetlemania It's bed time &amp; the puppy decided to park his butt right near my head. I hope he doesn't fart but if he does they're not too stinky. 🐶 Thank you for two hours of great TV. What a way to kick of the season. @Mariska @TheDannyPino @TheKelliGiddish @FINALLEVEL #SVU Really jumping into things by creating an Ariel Castro like episode. #SVU  #artimitatinglife What a way to kick of the season. And the acting by @Mariska was superb. #SVU It's a little weird to me that a guy who played a serial killer on CSI is playing a shrink on SVU. I have never been more disturbed that I have watching this episode. Vomit. #SVU #SaveBenson The fact that this guy thinks he'll be able to get away with all of this is insane. This team will not be going easy. #SVU #SaveBenson When an episode starts with the warning "this program contains intense scenes" you know it will be good. #SVU #SaveBenson @Mariska "It's possible, things are happening every day..." Watching the ethnically diverse version of Cinderella at work. 🌟👑👡 @RizzoliIslesTNT 3 people #RizzoliandIslestrivia I really think that I would have liked Miley's song 'Wrecking Ball' more had I not watched the music video. @happyydazee Hump Dayyyy!! 🐪🐫 What a great night of season premieres. #NCIS and #NCISLA never fail to entertain. Until next time. I wish I could take away Deeks' pain. It is breaking my heart &amp; I bet it is really hurting Kensi too.💔 @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen #NCISLA I'm no doctor but I don't really think Deeks was ready to leave a hospital bed... @ericcolsen #NCISLA RT @BarrettFoa: RT to win these signed @NCISLA_CBS hats! http://t.co/5KW9R4fj9V That was a beautiful scene between Deeks and Sam. @ericcolsen @llcoolj #NCISLA Ew, he actually cut off some of his skin. That's dedication to crazy. @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen @BarrettFoa @reneefsmith #NCISLA The fact that Michelle just pulled herself back into the building was so badass. #NCISLA A new tradition has been born. So happy to be watching #NCIS with @eHen10 whilst eating junk food to ease our pain/anxiety. You cannot show us that promo for the next episode and not expect us to freak out. Holy crapola. @M_Weatherly #NCIS #TIVA It makes me very happy that my timeline was hijacked by the NCIS cast. @M_Weatherly @PauleyP @BrianDietzen @SeanHMurray #tweetweek #NCIS False advertising! Ziva was not in the premiere at all. She best be in every scene next episode. @M_Weatherly @BrianDietzen @PauleyP #NCIS My favorite bromance is between Gibbs and Fornell. #NCIS Drowning my anxiety over this episode with peanut butter ice cream. @M_Weatherly @BrianDietzen @SeanHMurray #NCIS #dontmesswiththem Clearly people shouldn't mess with Vance and his family. #NCIS Ducky just took that guy out. They don't need security in autopsy. @BrianDietzen #NCIS Wait, Parsons is a good guy? Did not see that coming. #NCIS 1. Did a little happy dance when Ziva and Tony were talking. 2. Really like Abby being all jealous of McGee. @M_Weatherly @PauleyP #NCIS RT @BONESonFOX: Tonight is for group hugs and melding together, so...    Retweet this and we just might follow you! #bones Bones chanting in the sweat lodge. Classic. @BONESonFOX @emilydeschanel Wait, stop, that cannot be the end of the episode. I do not accept a crazy cliffhanger in the premiere. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic #Castle The fact that I didn't know Deadly Heat was already out is inexcusable. #Castlebooks @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic He's gonna help solve the case with that one picture cause that is who he is. @NathanFillion #castle Gonna be live tweeting this premiere. I will try not to spoil anything. #Castle @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic @seamusdever @Jon_Huertas It's timeeeeeee. They're back.  @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic  #willshesayyes That group choreography piece was so freaking good.

Super excited to see @ActuallyNPH host and all the other fun things that could happen.📺 A great night of fun. #twentyone #birthday 🎉🍹 @amandarleizear @ehen10 http://t.co/CiUChvgzBZ So an old ep of Castle was on one of the TVs at the bar tonight &amp; I really just wanted to sit and watch it... @NathanFillion @Jon_Huertas Happy 21st Birthday, nugget!! I cannot wait to celebrate with you tonight. Love ya lots. 🍺🍻🍸🍹🍷🎁🎉🎈❤️😃⚓️👯 @AmandaRLeizear You know it's a bad headache when 3 ibuprofen do nothing to alleviate it. Here's to hoping sleep makes it go away. Blahhhh. 😞👎 I just really love Booth and Brennan. 👫❤ @BONESonFOX @David_Boreanaz @emilydeschanel I really really hate how Booth cannot tell anyone about his situation. And how this is tearing his relationship with Bones apart. Bones. Bones. Bones. Bones. 💀💀💀💀💀💀 @BONESonFOX #seasonpremiere I just wanna be home watching the Bones season premiere. Silly work. Staying off twitter till I get back. @BONESonFOX Friends. ✨👯💕 @melissaaaa http://t.co/ay0kJWgxDL Rewatched the season finale in preparation for tomorrow. It made me just as mad as the first time. Pelant seriously has to go. #Bones And the power couple is the season 10 champs!! Congratulations @Dance10Amy and @Dance10FikShun. @DANCEonFOX #SYTYCD Just saw the premiere promos for NCIS and NCIS:LA on CBS. Sept 24 cannot come soon enough. @M_Weatherly @PauleyP @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen RT @emilydeschanel: "@mindykaling: I would definitely have this convo with the lovely @emilydeschanel, esp the kissing part. http://t.co/r8… Hanging out at the top of the stairs when everyone's in the kitchen. Our little weirdo. 🐶 http://t.co/iVNos7qSkN I want a really big meal of foods that are mildly to extremely unhealthy. 🍕🍔🍟🍝🍩🍦🍪 #cravings #gimmesomejunkfood Um, #Graceland is probably the most badass show. And there is so much crazy ishh going down. The finale next week is gonna be insane. Just took the GRE. My brain is so exhausted. My reward, a salted caramel mocha frappachino. Just found out that Gillian Flynn's book 'Dark Places' is being made into a movie. God, I hope it's good. #booktomovie @RizzoliIslesTNT @RizzlesUnltd @JanetTamaro Thank you! I will be early awaiting to see what is to come for this team. If next week is the summer finale then how many episodes (if any) are airing in winter? @RizzoliIslesTNT @RizzlesUnltd @janettamaro Voted for my favorites but this season I believe they are all winners. They are beyond brilliant. @DANCEonFOX #SYTYCD Two of my favorite hip-hoppers dancing together. In a word, baller. @Dance10FikShun @official_tWitch #werk #SYTYCD Note to self: when you get an apartment make sure to buy a DVR that allows you to record multiple shows. 📺 #tvaddictprobs @RebeccaKinsey Me too. I miss our psych class fun. @bearybrit You will do great!! This is so exciting!! 😃😁🎉 Only took me 3 months but I finally finished this protein. 💪 http://t.co/8TN3lco0Nv It is September. That means this month I'm finally reunited with my little nugget to celebrate her 21st!!  😃👍🎉🍸🍹❤ @AmandaRLeizear My current jam: Acapella by @karminmusic. Love the lyrics, especially the use of totes. #immadoitacapella And the top two power couples just made it to the finale. Not surprised but still so excited. @DANCEonFOX #SYTYCD I think no matter who goes to the finale, the top 6 have already proved that they are all-stars &amp; are going to do great things. #SYTYCD I absolutely love when @jessetyler guest judges on SYTYCD. He is just perfect. @DANCEonFOX That scene with @JaneRizzoli and Mama Rizzoli smacking Giovani. Classic. #RizzoliandIsles Let's be real, after that JT performance nothing else really matters. #VMAs Um sorry, that was the most anticlimactic reunion ever. But Justin is perfect so I don't care. #NSync #VMAs There must be some sleep god that hates me. Waking up after 7.5 hours when I have so much more time is cruel. It's gonna be a coffee Sunday. My Saturday night is consisting of GRE prep whilst listening to my Glee playlist. Jealous? Didn't think so. #dedicationorcraziness Dropped my sister off at school today. I guess I'll miss that little weirdo. The house will certainly be quieter. @NikkiD102 Oh my goodness. The premiere cannot come soon enough!! @Mariska @TheDannyPino #SaveBenson #SVU http://t.co/Ka0LpXQKAS What an amazing performance by @Dance10Amy and @travlSova. He really likes to put these flights through air into his choreography. #SYTYCD I would love to dance with @official_tWitch. But I would look super awkward cause he's so freaking good. #SYTYCD This time Jane gets to save Korsak from the serial killer. Ultimate repayment. #RizzoliandIsles @JaneRizzoli I don't like beer but I kinda want to try a Blue Moon after watching this season of Rizzoli and Isles. @RizzlesUnltd @JaneRizzoli Giving my dog a big hug after that scene with Hoyt. #RizzoliandIsles @JaneRizzoli I have a feeling that this episode is going to be a doosey. #Hoytisback #RIPLeeThompsonYoung #RizzoliandIsles @JaneRizzoli @MauraIsles I could watch @Dance10FikShun do solos all day. He is brilliant. #SYTYCD #hiphop Having a big bowl of cereal for dinner cause I'm not in the mood to put together anything else. #lazy #cantcook Watching the season 5 ep of Bones where @ZooeyDeschanel plays Brennan's second cousin &amp; only quotes Ben Franklin. #sogreat @emilydeschanel Sad to hear about the passing of Lee Thompson Young.

How will I wait for season 3? @RachelNichols1 @webstervictor @melissaaaa Me too. But because I had work at 8am today.

They must hurt a lot. #continuum @RachelNichols1 @webstervictor Just started watching Continuum. 12 episodes in 2 days &amp; I don't regret it.

Beautiful dance. Counting down the hours at work till I drive up to see @Kwiderman.

First order of business, haircut. 💇💇 RT @happyydazee: I love it when @shemarmoore says baby girl #criminalminds I probably should've avoided twitter tonight since @shemarmoore is  tweeting the Criminal Minds finale. Totally had things spoiled for me... So proud of my Lsquared for finishing her first year of teaching. You can come home now. 😃👍🌟🎉 @TaylorPauline25 I really just want to be watching the Criminal Minds &amp; SVU finales right now. I guess I'll settle for a day late. #sillywork #crampinmystyle My life would be so much easier if I could apparate. #notraffic #nostupiddrivers Had a dream where I was Rory Gilmore. But I didn't act like her. Don't care cause that means @thelaurengraham was my mom and she's the best. What an incredibly long day. And tomorrow is another one.

I really really love @official_tWitch. Is it time to go home yet?? #longshift #justwanttorelax I seriously wish I were going to either Luke Bryan or The Band Perry tonight. Alas, no concerts for me. Over the years, I have found that the unsubs have gotten more and more psychopathic. Thank god for the BAU. #criminalminds Feel like crap. Running around for 2 days with no real break will do that to you. Hope this passes quick cause I don't have time for this. Watched the NCIS:LA finale. I can't even deal with that ending. @ericcolsen @DanielaRuah @llcoolj @chrisodonnell @reneefsmith @BarrettFoa Watched @PauleyP, @BrianDietzen, @M_Weatherly, Cote and Mark on The Talk (from yesterday). I was dying of laughter. Can I join the cast now? Lastly, how much longer are Tony &amp; Ziva going to do this dance. They are clearly past the "just friends/partners" stage. #NCIS @M_Weatherly I hate that we have to wait 4 months to see the results of the cliffhanger. But I guess even team Gibbs needs a break. @M_Weatherly @PauleyP Dear NCIS people, Thank you for an amazing 10th season. I've enjoyed watching all the drama &amp; fun. Can't wait for next season. ❤, a big fan. Why would anyone want to try to fight this NCIS team? They'll never win, ever. #theythebest #teamGibbs I'm might regret watching the NCIS season finale when I have to wake up but I couldn't not see what happens. #priorities #sleepvstv Can't be on twitter. Have to avoid the spoilers from @M_Weatherly @PauleyP &amp; @BrianDietzen about the NCIS finale.

And the whole episode in general. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic #Castleseasonfinale The Castle fandom is gonna have a hard time waiting for season 6. #cliffhanger @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic @Jon_Huertas @seamusdever This finale is not intense in the same way as last year's, but it is still making me just as anxious. #Castle Thank god for mothers. Martha is giving Castle a nice kick in the butt. #Castle #finale Time for the #Castle season finale. I'm not sure I'm emotionally prepared for the drama that is sure to occur. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic Saturday night fun. The creation - cake batter blondies. #nomz http://t.co/zY4iNwU2og At work and the remix to @martinamcbride's 'Ride' comes on. I can dig it. #touchthesky Really really upset that NBC cancelled 'Go On'. I'm gonna miss my weekly @MatthewPerry fix. Is Hetty trying to play matchmaker with Deeks and Kensi? #NCISLA @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen Criminal Minds has been picked up! Now I just need to know who isn't coming back. @shemarmoore @Vangsness @ajcookofficial @GUBLERNATION Finally watching Tuesday's NCIS:LA. I love that Kensi is jealous Deeks. @DanielaRuah @ericcolsen #morethanpartners Tonight's #NCIS thoughts - I love that Tony totally called Ziva out on thinking she was alone; team Gibbs rocks (but everyone knows that). Seeing @mindykaling on Katie Couric's show but not hearing the interview is such a tease. I want to hear her talk about life. That amazing feeling of accomplishment after you've untangled two necklaces &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love that Espo thinks Castle's crazy theories are nuts and Ryan is all about them. @NathanFillion @Jon_Huertas @seamusdever @eHen10 I love you and that tweet so much. #NCISdorks Kisses from my puppy. 💋🐶 http://t.co/57Tf1xmhlE Relaxing after an 8 hour work day. #legshurt #backhurts #ooph Chips, salsa, guac, (fake) margarita. #cincodemayo #nomz http://t.co/DPY8VFd85Q 4 hours down, 4 more to go. #makingthemoneyz 💰💰💰 Up and at 'em bright and early for the first day of work.

Does she not realize that everyone on Team Gibbs will have her back in a second?! #NCIS It came, yay!! Can't wait to read it. http://t.co/Ela27hpcmq Dayum, we all knew Ziva was a bad-ass ninja, but that was, woah. #NCIS So ready to see how everything turns out. #NCIS #teamGibbs #TIVA This episode almost made my heart burst from happiness.

You shouldn't mess with them. #NCIS #teamGibbs Mothereffer, my heart rate just spiked in 20 seconds.

The shipper in me is excited for the Tiva and Densi stuff tonight. Let's get started... That moment when you look over and the person in the car next to you is clearly jamming to the same radio station. 🚙📻🎶 Best line so far: "You've keyed cars, slashed tires. Straight out if a Carrie Underwood song." -Esposito @Jon_Huertas #Castle I am really loving jealous Castle. And I'm not liking the flirting this guy is doing with Beckett. @NathanFillion @Stana_Katic @KellyFerree Also, we'll be seeing The Heat. The Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy movie when you're here. @KellyFerree We can have some marathons on the comfy basement couch when you come to visit. :) I want to go shopping and bake sweet treats.

I hate the term "legitimate rape" and this defendant. @Mariska @TheDannyPino Sophomore year with the best. #tbt #jmu 💛💜 @bearybrit http://t.co/Suod4fCmoJ Any type of Reece's product is my weakness. Seriously, chocolate and peanut butter, where can you go wrong? #sweettooth Someone is a wittle sweepy. 🐶😴 http://t.co/H00GZb9lAc Wednesday FRIENDSday. Love this scene. #pivotpivot (And yes, I just created this day.) http://t.co/aJE24VU8QF We've only had a 2 episode teaser but I can safely say that I'm obsessed with NCIS:Red. Then again I am partial to crime shows. #NCISfamily Time for the other part of the NCIS family. Let's see how this two-parter ends. #NCISLA #NCISRed Sometime I wonder what Gibbs is thinking after Palmer makes his awkward jokes. @BrianDietzen #NCIS Time for #NCIS. Excited to meet McGee's father. The last of the team whose father we have to meet. @SeanHMurray Happened to me too. #norespect RT @martinamcbride: 0h this bird is WORKING it outside my window this morning! #cheerybird #tooearly So happy for Ryan and Jenny. They're pregnant. Pop the champagne or the sparkling grape juice. 🍸🎉👶 @seamusdever @cleverdever #99Castles My favorite scene of this episode: Ryan calling out to his team &amp; saying they shouldn't be messed with. @seamusdever  #99Castles I bet it is killing Javi to not be able to back Ryan up. @seamusdever @Jon_Huertas #99Castles Ryan has some explaining to do. Actually a lot of explaining. #99Castles @seamusdever Time for episode number 99 of #Castle. Cannot wait to get a glimpse into Ryan's past as a narcotics cop. @seamusdever Blown away by @kelliepickler and @derekhough's jazz routine. It was out of this world. #DWTS @KellyFerree Yes, I want him. And a Derek Morgan. And a Spencer Reid. And a Tony Dinozzo. And a Jethro Gibbs. #lovethosespecialagentmen Booth is so good to Bones. I love when he reassures her. 👫❤💋 #soinlove #perfectpartners @BONESonFOX Apparently people get crazy when a camera is in front of them. 😜🎥📹 @BONESonFOX #mancrushMonday #Jesse #perfect @skylarastin http://t.co/oEGn7xWFYb I would love to #BeOnFox.

I am definitely moving south or to the west coast. ☀ #needwarmth Nails 💅 #springcolors #mint #purple http://t.co/OnRuP2Rk9J Getting myself back on track after the weekend of poor eating and no workouts. Time for some treadmill and Pinterest workouts. My iPod is dead meaning I have to listen to the radio and/or CDs during my drive home. #firstworldprobs Great trip down to the 'burg filled with lots of fun &amp; great friends. Sad to be leaving.  @Kwiderman @AmandaRLeizear @LizzyJaneDavis @melissaaaa Me either. I'm an expert on watching NCIS marathons on USA... Literally that is all I do. @melissaaaa Yes! I will text ya tomorrow night when I get home from da burg. :) @melissaaaa Yesss, we definitely need a reunion soon. Some of the best girls a girl could ask for. ❤👯 http://t.co/KpNHzbknRV @melissaaaa I second @bearybrit's tweet. I love your hurrrr. Saturday adventures with @Kwiderman #route11chips #clowns http://t.co/orwHXnCgsV @melissaaaa It was artistically pretty interesting but I did not enjoy it overall. @melissaaaa Yes. So not worth seeing in theaters. It has absolutely no point and I felt so dirty after it. So many thing I wish I could un-see. RT @Kwiderman: Spring Breakers. Worst. Movie. Ever. JMU, I'm coming for you. 💜💛💜💛 So how do I become an actress that gets saved from the unsub by Derek Morgan? @shemarmoore #CriminalMinds @KellyFerree The ones my mom gave you? I say eat some. Oh man, I love when #SVU uses themes that happened in real life. Can't wait for next week's episode dealing with "legitimate rape". @Mariska @melissaaaa @bearybrit Let's do ittttt. 😃👍😃👍😃 @bearybrit @melissaaaa I'm down for a little road trip. @melissaaaa @bearybrit Let's work on that. Like ASAP. I'm kinda loving the stubble that Amaro is rocking right now. #SVU @TheDannyPino How many more things can be thrown at Amaro in one episode?? #SVU @TheDannyPino @bearybrit @melissaaaa Um, we need to get together at some point. I miss everyone!! Brand new #SVU. Cannot wait to find out who Benson's boo is. @Mariska @TheDannyPino I love when my dog sleeps in my bed. I do not, however, like when he farts near my head. #stinky #silentkillers "Wamma bama Delta Gamma" Whaddup DG shout out (kinda) on The Mindy Project. @mindykaling #anchorseverywhere After just an episode, I'm already excited about NCIS: Red. I really hope it gets picked up for next season. #lovemetheNCISteams @KellyFerree You'll be back soon enough. And I can't waitttt :) :) @KellyFerree You also need a vacation. Now on to the #NCISLA with the first part of the special intro of the Red Team. Gosh I really love this franchise. #NCISfamily #oorahh So excited for this new #NCIS episode directed by the one and only @M_Weatherly. Happy to be spending my evening in with some of my favorite people - Gibbs, Tony, Ziva, McGee, Abby &amp; Ducky. #NCIS #relaxing Happy St. Patty's day!

Remember sophomore year, @bearybrit. #snowpocalypse Snow snow snow. ❄ http://t.co/GQFzVrXExH Just watched an episode of NCIS that I had never seen. Didn't think that was possible. I really hope it doesn't snow as much as the forecast predicts. It will really screw up my plans for the next few days. ❄🚫👎 ... Can't wait to read the book and discuss it with @LizzyJaneDavis. #bookclub #welovetoread Tonight I heard @jodipicoult talk about the research she did for her new book, The Storyteller. And I talked to her about The Sunflower... Got my copy of The Storyteller signed by Jodi Picoult. Can't wait to start reading it. http://t.co/NSCZ09iwlt Spotted: @seamusdever playing the bartender/bad guy on this NCIS episode. NCIS marathon and cuddling with the puppy. Happy Monday.  🐶📺 👍 #lovebeinghome Celebrating Delta Gamma's founders day at the Army Navy country club. All I can think about is an episode of NCIS. #inthebonds The thing I dislike most about being home - having to go through all the mail. #grownupprobz Got two-ish hours of sleep after being awake for almost 24 hours. Lots of coffee &amp; a nap will have to get me through the day #jetlagsucks @LizzyJaneDavis @AmandaRLeizear Love you both and cannot wait to see you next week. :) :) "It was like a sad handwritten novel."

Just let @JaneRizzoli help you, darn it. @RizzoliIslesTNT @RizzlesUnltd Hm, that's a tough 1. RT @RizzoliIslesTNT: Who's team would you want to play on? The homicide team? Or the crime lab team? #RizzoliandIsles Eeek, I'm so happy that Casey is back. But I'm just hoping there is some sort of happiness involved. @JaneRizzoli @RizzoliIslesTNT It's @RizzoliIslesTNT time! @JaneRizzoli @MauraIsles @Angie_Harmon @SashaAlexander1 It is absolutely precious that Tony has a goldfish named Kate. #NCIS @M_Weatherly @SashaAlexander1 Amen sistah.

Cannot wait for all the celebrations to be had during our European adventures. I really want a large bag of Reece's Pieces. Who will bring me one? @TaylorPauline25 I went to pick up my sister. I may have gotten a little lost so it made the trip a bit longer. So incredibly sleepy. I guess driving for about 5 hours will do that to you. Listening to the coverage of this shooting is heartbreaking. Innocent children, really? 💔 #prayersforCT @RizzoliIslesTNT @MauraIsles Marie Curie and Agnodice #RandIgiveaway Hey @NikkiD102, I'm coming for ya! I really dislike drawn out results shows. Too much extra crap. Thank goodness the rest of my family &amp; my friends are coming home this weekend. I need more social interaction than just my dog &amp; dad.

I really hope this cleanse ends up being worth it. #justwantahamburger @KissIt_Sucka yep yep, I am a NoVA child and am free as a bird. @KissIt_Sucka yes please!!!! Holiday themed episodes of my fave shows make me so happy. But can we get some Hanukah up in hurr? Or do I have to find a holiday armadillo? So true, meep. #hungry RT @KellyFerree: Just by browsing @DaniDee19 pinterest I can tell she is on a cleanse.  #foodonfoodonfoodonfood @KellyFerree Yes, I did. And it was great. @KellyFerree Don't joke, I am dying. Questioning my decision to do the Dr. Ox detox cleanse.  One day in and I'm already craving a big burger.

I don't hate it. :) #surferdude #NCISLA I loved seeing Ziva open up to Tony and then him turning around and being all sweet to her. @M_Weatherly #Tiva #NCIS Any episode of TV that deals with veteran PTSD breaks my heart. I'm looking at you, NCIS. I love how @TheEllenShow helps these amazing and deserving people. #inspiring I love TV dramas and the crazy curve-balls that are thrown around.

I want that in my life. @Angie_Harmon @SashaAlexander1 @RizzoliIslesTNT I love Rondo and how he calls @JaneRizzoli Vanilla. @RizzoliIslesTNT @Angie_Harmon I love that all of the episode titles from this season are song titles, including a few from Adele. @JanetTamaro @RizzoliIslesTNT Just warning you, tweeps, I will be live tweeting the @RizzoliIslesTNT summer finale. @SashaAlexander1 Everything Nice. #RizzoliandIsles Just gotta get through the last hour of work, the commute home &amp; a fitness class then it's @RizzoliIslesTNT party time! #summerfinale Kinda already obsessed with @taylorswift. #WeAreNeverEverGettingBackTogether http://t.co/YBy5a00o Cannot wait!!

Only two more years until the Winter Games!!! #Olympics "Spice Up your life..." What a great throwback to my favorite pop group of my childhood. #SpiceGirls #ClosingCeremony #Olympics Russel Brand as Willy Wonka?

May it be filled with love, laughter, a little bit of craziness. You don't look a day over 25. 🎁🎉 Not only have I lost the 15 I gained during the school year but I'm also in the best shape I've been in a while. Feels good! #werk #proud Literally so excited for this movie. @AnnaKendrick47 @ElizabethBanks #pitchperfect #nodiggity - http://t.co/1gdTmKtS Is it bad at I'm jealous of the Olympic athletes for not only their athleticism but also for all of the #Nike swag they wear daily? #wantit It's Book Lovers Day! #bookworm #myfavs http://t.co/IRJvb9Lh #USA #USA #USA 🇺🇸⚽🇺🇸⚽🇺🇸⚽ Me too! RT @martinamcbride: Once again. I really. Really. Wanna live in Stars Hollow. #iknowitsnotrealbutirealllyreallyywannalivetherereally Kinda obsessed with the Gymnastics team. @gabrielledoug, @jordyn_wieber, @aly_raisman, @McKaylaMaroney, @kyla_ross96 #fiercefive #olympics 'Outrageous' came on my iPod. It will forever &amp; always remind me of this scene: http://t.co/KzsQR6nT @SashaAlexander1 @M_Weatherly #NCIS Totally read the synopses for 5 of the 6 books left in the pack &amp; learned some major spoilers. Now I just wanna read &amp; see how it happens!! What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? I am still failing to see how my early wake up is making me stronger. @IshJennaknows Talking and yelling over here. It's ridiculous. Like what I say can change the outcome/they can hear me. Haha. @IshJennaknows Oh, I am for sure right there with you. I also get too emotionally invested and tend to think of characters as my friends... @IshJennaknows Homegirl, I'm totally worse. I got half of the cop dramas on CBS. It's a sickness but I cannot (and will not) stop. Finished "The Apprentice". Didn't think I could be more creeped out by Hoyt. I was very wrong. @TessGerritsen @JanetTamaro #RizzoliandIsles Tonight I am a waking Nike advertisement. #swoosh #justdoit http://t.co/E232lFjH The thing I like about my commute - I get to read for about 35 minutes. #silverlining #bookworm Ugh, Mondays sucks. #justwannastayinbed Take me out to the ball game. #Nats #DGday http://t.co/XofI7L0n RT @NBCOlympics: 22 #Olympic Medals. 18 #Olympic Golds. 1 greatest #Olympian of all time. #MichaelPhelps So many colors!! #nike #workout  http://t.co/fwuUxTX1 I love listening to my iPod on shuffle b/c something like 'Shake' by the Ying Yang Twins comes after 'Colors of the Wind' from Pocohantus.

A challenge I'm ready to take. @Angie_Harmon @SashaAlexander1 @JanetTamaro #RizzoliandIsles If someone could teach me how to get @Angie_Harmon's hair on Rizzoli &amp; Isles I would be a very happy person. @RizzoliIslesTNT #obsessed Finally caught up on the women's gymnastics team finals. Literally in tears from happiness. Immensely proud of the #FabFive. #USA. 🇺🇸🇺🇸 It's Wednesday!! #humpday #midweek The knowledge that I'll be very unhappy tomorrow is the only (and most important) thing keeping me from watching @RizzoliIslesTNT right now. Field trip to Quantico. Visited the FBI and DEA academies. http://t.co/7TxZdxf6 That moment when you've dried your hair straight for the first time in a week and you realize how long it's gotten. RT @happyydazee: I wish it was socially acceptable to skip work the next couple weeks to sit at home and watch the #olympics #wishfulthi ... Working out and catching up on the #Olympics. Finished the book All We Ever Wanted Was Everything by Janelle Brown. Thank you @ElizabethBanks for a great suggestion. #bookclub Just saw Step Up Revolution. A perfect way to celebrate #nationaldanceday. It was incredible and so inspiring. #ijustwannadance "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain." Happy National Dance Day!! @catdeeley @dizzyfeet Ooph, gotta wake up at 7:15 tomorrow to get to the airport. #justwannasleepin Olympics Opening Ceremony!!! Ate Bojangles and a double chocolate cupcake today. Yeah, I definitely need to work out. Wow, that Stacey Tookey routine gave me goosebumps. Between the music and the choreography, it was a powerful piece. #SYTYCD Catching up on last night's #SYTYCD - a cha cha to Call Me, Maybe? Hmm, not sure how I feel about it. @TaylorPauline25 um, this is great! Love @LauraBellBundy.YouTube - http://t.co/4EGnZhBS Motivation. RT @Angie_Harmon: Today is a great day! No matter how tired you are, push thru to make it your best!! @bearybrit Yes indeed, yes indeed. @bearybrit Ooph, I look like a mess. First Halloween together! :) Literally falling asleep at my desk. Today is going to be rough... #coffeecoffeecoffee I don't think I'll ever get used to my 5:30am wake time. I'm so tired!! #realworldprobz Looked up left-handed actresses. Along with @Angie_Harmon there is Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Judy Garland and more. #leftiesunite Wishing a very Happy Birthday to my LLBFF, @TaylorPauline25. I hope you have a fabulous day. Love ya! 😃👍😘🎁🎉🍸❤ Santorini. #takemeback http://t.co/OmwoZfsW Really wishing I could've watched @RizzoliIslesTNT. At least I have something to look forward to tomorrow. #silverlining Just ate lots of chocolate. Thank goodness I'm going to zumba tonight with @TaylorPauline25.

Sugarland at JLL! #inyourhands http://t.co/wrrWjdLn Exciting stuff happening - analyzing the lyrics of Genie in a Bottle &amp; taking typing tests. #supercool Sometimes I miss @SashaAlexander1 as Kate on NCIS but if she were still there then she wouldn't be the wonderful Maura Isles. Catching up on Duets finale. John and @JenniferNettles' "For Good" was magical. And congratulations to JRome, so deserved! #teamNettles
