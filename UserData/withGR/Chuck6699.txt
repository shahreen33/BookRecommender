The novel was much better by Michael Connelly. Albums I've played this weekend, Rahsaan Patterson's new album called Bleuphoria is brilliant. Played Prince's Parade which is a classic. Just heard that Carlton Cole has committed his future to West Ham. To be honest the Championship is his level. The original version of The Thing is one of my all time favourite movies.

Jamie Foxx confirms Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained http://zite.to/jpUMSF via @zite Just started reading Cormac McCarthys The Orchard Keeper. This was the first novel he ever wrote. A strange but interesting read so far. Watched the first 2 episodes of be US version of The Killing. Good little murder mystery. My wife loves this kind of stuff. Watched second episode of Game of Thrones. Not too bad. Still needs to raise its game (no pun intended). Played 3 albums today. John Legend's Evolver, Anthony Hamilton's The Point of it All and Prince's Around The World In A Day. Loved them all. It will be very interesting to see how the Life of Pi movie turns out. Due to be released in 2012. Just finished reading Life of Pi by Yann Martel. Very enjoyable and well written novel. Highly recommended. Djokovic has played unbelievable today. Fully deserved to win Wimbledon. Djokovic is playing incredibly well. I don't see how Nadal can come back from this onslaught. Incredible tennis from the Serb. Getting ready to watch the men's Wimbledon final. I predict a 5 set match with Nadal edging it. Klitschko wins on points. Probably the right decision but I question why the ref counted Haye after he was clearly pushed. Haye keeps falling over or being pushed over by Klitschko. Halfway through and all even for me. Settling down to watch the Haye fight. I'm getting nervous for Haye. Let's hope for a good fight. Here we go!!!! I can't believe this is Sinead O'Connor. Not many people know that Prince wrote Nothing Compares 2 U http://t.co/4hENFnA Had a really good BBQ today with the family. Weather held up. Our first BBQ for a couple of years.

You pay a premium for taking your car to them so this is unacceptable. They still didn't carry out a repair for the problem I originally took the car in for. They have given me a courtesy car for the weekend. Having a shocking time with a Volkswagen dealership. Paid a large some of money for work that I now discover was not required.

I also finished re-watching season 4 of the second best tv series of all time, The Wire. Last night I finished watching season 2 of Justified. This show is superb. Catch it if you can. Sad to hear about Peter Falk passing away today. Columbo was an all time great. R.I.P. Just finished watching The Apprentice on Sky+. Finally I agree with Lord Sugar as Leon definitely deserved to be fired. Played my favourite album of last year again...Kanye Wests My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. An amazing record. Spent Fathers Day watching movies with my kids. Monsters v Aliens went down well! Happy Fathers Day to all my fellow dads. Watched Fire in Babylon today which is about the great West Indian cricket team of the 70s & 80s. Recommended even if you don't like cricket Loving the new Nas single Nasty. I cannot wait for the new album called Life is Good. Just finished watching Source Code. A cross between Groundhog Day and Inception. I liked it but you must concentrate throughout the movie Good to see Jagged Edge return with a new album called The Remedy. Nothing groundbreaking but still enjoyable. Sorry to see Demba Ba leave West Ham for Newcastle. He did OK for us. You must get this brilliant Skyzoo mixtape called The Great Debater. It's free to download. http://t.co/fI67llA Upson gone, Gabbidon gone, Spectre gone, Jacobson gone!! The clear out at West Ham begins. I cannot wait to play the new Jill Scott and Ledisi albums this weekend. Watched The Apprentice tonight and I have no idea why Jim was not fired. That guy is so dodgy. Two suspect firings in a row by Lord Sugar. Been playing the Royce Da 59/Eminem collaboration album and the Random Axe album today. Both pretty decent records. Just hearing about Kevin Nolan coming to my beloved West Ham United. Never thought he would drop to the championship but I rate him highly. Just heard about a conspiracy to murder Joss Stone in Devon. Why would anyone want to kill Joss Stone? Bizarre! Watched Unknown last night. Liam Neeson was in it and it reminded me of the films Harrison Ford used to make in the 80s. It was an Ok movie. I'm playing Change's The Glow of Love featuring Luther Vandross. Great stuff. Playing some old school classics today. Remember Cheryl Lynn's Encore. Still sounds good to me. A very happy birthday to my darling wife. Last time I looked England u21s losing and Vettell well ahead in Canadian Grand Prix. England manage to draw 1-1 and Button wins GP. Wow!
