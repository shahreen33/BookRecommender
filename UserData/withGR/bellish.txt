Just tried on my whole Buffy outfit and it's AWESOME. I'm gonna kick ass on Friday. Hopefully not literally, but if I have one too many... @srbishop yes, it is good isn't it? Gets epic very fast. Make sure you have both season finales. I think they weren't aired or something. Really wish I'd bought them a month ago so I'd've had the motivation to do it the proper way... RT @SnoozeInBrief: OK, this is pretty good. http://t.co/2efq4mYx The last sentence is perfect. I have never crash dieted in my life but I have 4 days to make the red leather trousers for my Buffy costume look ok. Any tips, Twitter? We made Frankfurt themed cookies.

Should probably just get that last quarter knitted! @kimberleytew did you just make those? So cute! I suddenly feel like an inadequate auntie *looks at 3/4 knitted Christmas vest* Having an exam paper to do seems particularly cruel on New Year's Day.

I've stopped buying them as I can't hold on to them. Book club drinks at New Bloomsbury Set. They sell stealth cocktails. Waaaah. Wednesday.
