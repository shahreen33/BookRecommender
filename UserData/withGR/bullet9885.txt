In the past year, I have spent time searching for who I was, going back to my roots a bit, and figuring out the path laid out ahead of me. I thought maybe I left too quick and didn't give it a chance but in reality leaving was my chance to be the best version of ME.

I will not punch a customer today. I will not punch a customer today. I will not punch a customer today. I read it so fast the first time through, I wanna reread it to pick up on what I missed &amp; get all the feels again. And by feels I mean Rhys. I have been wanting to read the last few days so thought I would pick up Frozen Tides...but now all I want to read is ACOWAR. 😑 I've been crying my entire lunch break and have no idea what to do now. How awesome it is to feel that my beliefs aren't valid. 😔 I was even told they "understand that as a woman/mom I probably feel I should be doing these things but may have to adjust  my expectations" Basically that unless I have no child care or am out of town, other reasons don't compare. 3/? Was told that I may have to suck it up and only ask for the major things off. That I'll probably get that time off but it's not guaranteed. That my family/ministry priorities aren't "big deals" or "important" enough to garner a change in availability. 2/? This company who I've worked my ass off for and sacrificed so much time with my family for, just made it abundantly clear that...1/? Got bad news about my new availability and needed days off at work. I may be unemployed in a few weeks....not how I wanted today to go. I am leaving for work and don't have the proper glasses, so I'll live vicariously through all of you for the Eclipse. #SolarEclipse2017 I may be just a tad bit SUPER excited for this.... https://t.co/v2xFf3Zbmt Not entering, just sharing for my friends who may have missed it!

Would appreciate good vibes that it all goes well and that they are willing to work around my families needs. I also give my new school year availability tomorrow which is different than what it's been since my promotion. 😳 Starting tomorrow I start an 8 day stretch at work, then still work 4 days after that before Labor day. Taking it one day at a time. @LifeWthnThePgs Thanks so much! Hopefully you feel better soon and it doesn't last too long. @LetsBookAboutIt I'll have to compare it to my kids when I get it and take a pic! @LetsBookAboutIt Right!!!! I don't use 3D features cause it gives me headaches so this 2DS one is perfect. @LifeWthnThePgs I didn't realize we were so close in age! How cool! Any fun plans for your bday? I do plan on treating myself to all of this or the hubs will. The HP tattoo w/friends I'm SUPER stoked for!! 😬😬😬 18 days til my birthday and I'm making my wishlist.

I was able to squeeze in 30 minutes of shooting peoples so that's good. Charging up the controller and going to bed… https://t.co/JyfVq7eTU3 This is my life every day people. #shiny https://t.co/aQdNJFt6WQ F.M.L.  I quit this day so hard. So I figure, ok I'll play it on Feylin (my PS4). Not only is here a HUGE update, my controller is dead AND my ps plus is expired. 🙄 Then!!! I get home ready to play Overwatch on my Xbox and low and behold I can't find it anywhere. At all. It's gone. 😑😤 Tonight at worked sucked. I ate two brownies and ice cream on the way home due to stress.
