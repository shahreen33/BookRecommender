Back next year and see some of you at Pick'n'Mix @officialNAF final 3-1-2. Would have happy with that beforehand, but disappointing after day 1. @officialNAF Game 6 vs Ddark and the dice finally roll more than 7. 2-1 win vs Woodies but still tight. @officialNAF Day 2 collapses are so last year - shame I'm unfashionable... @officialNAF Game 5, and Elves diguised as Norse disguised as Space Marines.

Sorry, not buying it (the love, or the game). @BothDown Updates?  Patch .13 had to be fixed by patch .14, and it's still as bad as it was before.  New expansion at full game cost? @BothDown Great, another bug-ridden game that will get little or no support.  Buy it?  I think not. #Cyanide #shite @inkpwn time to spend those reward points and vouchers And sorry for lack of #arbbl updates today - hard to use the phone when you leave it a home. #arbbl Congrats to the winners. Ask me now, and never again. Ask me in a few days time and I'll be planning next years... #arbbl For round 4 lycos vs hawk table 1, moodygit is 3rd(!).  All arbbl bottom table. #ARBBL 13 of 44 Stunty Cup teams. No 'zons, skaven, nurgle, vamps or underworld. #ARBBL Round 2 and it's ceetee vs vmcat on table 1 and Itchen vs Lycos table 2. At the bottom it's warpedmind's pro vs sann's high elfs. #ARBBL A few no shows, but still 44 coaches for day 1. Ach! 25 hours to the #ARBBL and so much still to do. Just realised forgot to sort out the Stunty Cup - bugger! @TheRock Looking forward to WM. #TeamBringIt for the win. @wwe Just caught the first hour of this week's RAW.  What a waste of an hour! @RealKingRegal Who do we badger to get you back running RAW. Lairinitas(sp!) is sooo boring. Thank god for the FF button.

Nope, hadn't heard - don't take much interest in the stores now! ;) @weeman25 When I can be arsed.  Plus it don't like my crap phone. #NAFWC2011 Awesome weekend - damn that it's over.  Thanks to everyone there. @IMPACTWRESTLING Just like watching the crap Bishoff WCW era. You've great young talent - use them, not over-the-hill oldies. @IMPACTWRESTLING And that's why tyou're never be on par with WWE.  A fantastic main event, ruined by a bullshit finish.  Looked crap = crap. @chrisbevan_bbc Boring - as a Man Utd fan, nothing happening, nor likely to happen. Not sure if that's a bad thing or not! #bbcfootball @howardnurse Honestly expecting any deals?  I thought SAF and above were adamant that their window was over... So, did Wes ever actually board a plane to the UK? #bbcfootball @ahj When I can get Kerranng Radio back, R1 won't see more for dust! Chest infection is killing me -  I hate being ill. :( @ahj MORE METAL!!!!!! Am I right in think Hargreaves' doesn't have to sign for anyone today, as he's a free Agent?  #BBCFootball Loving the sounds of @Seasick_Steve - it's now got me listening to blues of last.fm. #r1moremoyles  TUUUNNNNEEEEEEEE!!!!  Good call - c'mon Chris and Dave, you can do it! Shame it's an 18month old pic, would have been even funnier if it was current: (@schofe)http://yfrog.com/hs6iwuj @jimjimjimany Get in!  Pass on my congrats to one and all! 2-2 with the Baggies? WTF? *bangs head against wall* Finally some good news.  PC repaired and ready for collection. Though I have to say I'd happily keep the courtesy car y insurance company provided! One week since some silly bitch totalled my car. Time to start looking for a new one. :( Spiky in 2 hours.  Not sure taking 'Zons is a good idea, but what the hell! After an interesting week of emails ref the ARBBL '11 figure... I could use a holiday! Out to buy a clothes airer - what an exciting life I lead... [yawn!] @BenPatterson1 Jeez... @BenPatterson1 Gotta make PK&Q next year.  (This will sound wrong but...) anyone I knew? @BenPatterson1 So the idea we had for this year has probably been put on hold until the ARBBL @BenPatterson1  It was going to be, but for a while we were unsure if we were going, then one of the lad's has moved to Germany for a year. Maybe Vamps, maybe DEs, maybe HEs. Yep, though no idea with what team yet! But Impact's working on a different fig, so all's not lost. Nope, apart from abuse my admin power on TFF. ;) @BenPatterson1 (minus an optional that hadn't been decided on, but included in email). @BenPatterson1 but have now released a "concept" that is almost exactly what I requested @BenPatterson1 Impact passed on next year's ARBBL fig, but suggested RJ.  They never replied. @BenPatterson1 Just arseholes.  IP/concept thieves - this is just the first time it's directly affected me. @BenPatterson1 But still crap?  Aren't you Eurobowling? Or is that after Geordiebowl? C'mon Trazponzor (or however you spell it!) @BenPatterson1 Not much. You? Bloody RollJordan. &gt;:( @dwarfcoach So why'd you go in? ;) Good luck to Pompey tomorrow. Hung parliment? Great(!) Think it's time to look at leaving the country. :(  Don't want to spend anymore days under Brown, let alone years.
