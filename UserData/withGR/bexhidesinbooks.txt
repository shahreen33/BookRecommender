Xxx RT @TescoBooks: RT and follow for the chance to win a ltd. edition copy of Shadow of Night and A Discovery of Witches by @DebHarkness! # ... @bethanyeve_ I have no idea why this would make you think of me Despite efforts to be prepared for my stinking cold, can NEVER find a tissue in my bag. Can always, without fail, find a poo bag #priorities Off to see the beautiful people at @7Stories today. Thinking this should become a regular Tuesday thing. How about I just stay home today and have beagle cuddles. Everyone cool with that? @suehurst04 ooh I really really want to read that! Let me know what you think. Hope you're having a lovely relaxing time xxx To get up or to stay in bed all day with City of Ashes. Decisions... @Claire_xx_ I think it would have been really sad for the old man if you'd said no though! Don't think it counts if you're there :) xxx @thisandyou seeing you was my highlight. Hugs aplenty! Xxx Feel like I should get an appointment at the GUM clinic after that creepy mess of a Turkish performance #eurovision @bethanyeve_ good clean joke! "@PuffinPost: #jokeday Why do bees have sticky hair? Because they use honeycombs!" @amandapalmer as you wish. Pretty sure any moisturiser labelled as "heavenly" isn't supposed to burn... So ill. Made better by graphic novels pinched off Dad. Hello (all) League of Extraordinary Gentleman, Grandville and Salem Brownstone. Let's see how 3 hours sleep goes. Love @TedBob for 3am emergency chai. Today was one of those "only looking at beagle puppies will get me through" kind of days Choice of skirt may be foolish. Can't exactly move in it. @lainitaylor AGREED. I also love the fact that (apart from Spirited Away) my dad looks exactly like every Studio Ghibli dad. It's charming. Kicked midweek wine all over carpet. Bugger off, Wednesday, I hate your face. Probably the second worst day I've had at work. Hello midweek wine. Ed: you know how women like gold? Me:... I think you're getting women confused with dwarves. Great event with @thatandybloke and then @imeldaofficial in the evening. Epic Monday. And you don't get many of those! @CaveManSi I saw photos of 13 year old you today at work. SO CUTE! Xxx @ThatAndyBloke you sure are. I'll see you monday afternoon as a matter of fact. Because I work at Cramlington. Not because i'm a stalker... Wine bought. Thai curry consumed. Arrival of friends expected. @JennBosworth haha any time! @JennBosworth that was me! I LOVED it! I've been babbling on about it to anyone who will listen (then tell them to go get their own copy) :D @thisandyou Geekhood (for next Monday, obviously) and Hitler's Angel. I've turned into a 13 year old boy. Think i'm ok with this. Beagle cuddles and books. Excellente. New sarong dress and bolero on the way! Now just need somewhere to wear it... @thisandyou @erin_m_lambert indeed! Love you lots! Xxx My day has been made by finding all of Huxley Pig on Netflix. Peppa Pig has nothing on Huxley. Oink oink! And people laughed at me when I bought wellies last week! Today was all about the TRUE LOVE (you heard me right, Miracle Max)! @BenMoorhouse only when she hasn't got prior engagements #socialbutterfly @BenMoorhouse had a nice author event at school, good day in general (with cake) and then chilli came round and ed and I watched lion king! Today was excellente. @thisandyou it is awesome. Thanks :) hope you're enjoying the sun! @thisandyou The Name of the Star and Ways to Live Forever. Started on Ministry of Pandemonium but went to sleep at 7.30! Finished two books and on to my third of the day. Happy Sunday. Will be good and clean bathrooms. Then will be rewarded by doing nothing except reading! @Claire_xx_ good rules to live by! Xxx I feel thoroughly spoiled the past two days. I am drunk! I have also had a lovely day. But mostly I am drunk! Creepers... @bethanyeve_ "@PreschoolGems: "I came as a tiger, that's just how I live."" @SarahBirch17 Birch. Always was a crazy one. @BenMoorhouse yet you still have the time to tweet about it? :) When food shopping, I feel it is always advisable to make up one third of the total cost with Disney DVDs and Scrabble. I think i'm having a conversation with my mam. Turns out she's not listening. Just staring at my shoes. Chilli looking sharp http://t.co/2P8TlEEe Beagle is overwhelmed by the choice of toys she has available to hump (but doesn't actually know how) @barryhutchison dunno what chump you heard that from... Really I loved it. Made 4hr megabus journey ENJOYABLE. Could there be higher praise? @thisandyou I miss my sums buddy! I tell kids complaining about algebra that I love it. They look at me like I just fell out of a tree. @thisandyou I know! It's like Number of mint looking books= MANY. Number of minutes to sit and read them= GREAT DEAL LESS THAN MANY. @thisandyou no I haven't but I have the michael grant on the list! @thisandyou oliver twisted, code name verity (go electric monkey), the 13th horseman, new YA philippa gregory, my list is up to 65 titles... @Souperpowered sadly, the complete lack of leverage means it will be more of a polite request xxx Got asked to write up a list of book demands for our library. Put every @cassieclare book down. Good day. RT @hodderchildrens: RT to win this selection of #vampirediaries goodies! UK only winner will be selected at random after 1pm Wed 14th!! ... Got asked by a child today if I knew his friends that he's going to visit. In Australia. Why would that scenario make any sense to him? @bethanyeve_ "@TFLN: (248): Charles Darwin would shit his pants if he saw that we managed to survive that weekend." @TedBob haha aw! Chills is not watching crufts tonight. In protest of having a bath. Xxx Why is it not bed time yet? @bethanyeve_ remind you of anyone? http://t.co/u9EwJdFd @bethanyeve_ "@simonpegg: I've now decided to attend the party in my tummy. #yogabbagabba" @thisandyou are we there yet. Had a break for my Granda though. Was wondering what sort of mince mam would make for tea.His bet's on turtle. Going to read some David Levithan. Ready for my heart to be warmed. @thisandyou hugs back. You always have the best plans xxx Think my day off is a write off from here on in. I resent the fact that days off just give me time to realise how bad I feel. @ZiggyShortcrust happy birthday, pretty lady! Xxx I feel like I'm in a horror film. Only rather than being scared there's a murderer outside my room, I fear the weather outside my window. @bethanyeve_ EH? "@WhatTheFFacts: Superman had a pet monkey named "Beppo."" What a luxuriating pup. #dog'slife http://t.co/47dEkqom Curled up under many blankets with a good book and a (for the time being) good beagle. RT @welovethisbook: WIN A BOOK A WEEK FOR THE NEXT YEAR. RT this tweet before 5pm today for a chance to win #bookaweek. Details here htt ... Going to spend the day with my Grandsnappy. Spot of lunch then old films (Cary Grant I think) will do nicely. @thisandyou I MISS YOU TOO. Thank you for a lovely evening. Definitely need a repeat in the near future. And LOVE the hair! @bethanyeve_"@preschoolgems: "Happy Valentine's Day, sillyheads!"" @bethanyeve_ "Watching Nick Sharratt@7Stories draw sock animals.Kid suggested a Sock Lobster so he asked us to sing the song.3 of us got it" I always worry when starting a new book that I've made the wrong decision and should have started a different one. #UnnecessaryStress Dislike use of short people to take photos for IDs. Results in awful photos taken from below chin angles. Did we learn nothing from myspace? @thisandyou my dad does that too! Xxx @thisandyou -hug- Also, whenever I need to write houmous I get super stressed about spelling it wrong and being judged. Actually looked it up before tweet. All I have to tweet is the long list of chores done before half 9 on a sunday morning. Oh and I stood in a pot of houmous. Joy. Have had some quality time with the beagle Found unlabelled cd must have made when about 17. First four tracks- MCR, Tori Amos, Stevie Wonder, Crystal Castles. Naturally. @bethanyeve_ same. And actually being excited just for having the energy to read. Party party party! @bethanyeve_ you too. What you up to? @bethanyeve_ I'm at home, you dweeb. You had a good day? Xxx Stranded in ikea car park with a flat car battery #unimpressed Being told to sit down and read my book with a chai whilst @TedBob sorts the house is a very nice way to start Saturday @Marie_Lu I like that your dogs would be so eloquent. If mine saw a UFO I'm pretty sure she'd just be wondering if it tasted like bacon. and @TedBob now have a beautiful baby micra. Aw just look at it shine. Desperately need a car jar to wipe away that previously owned smell. @ZiggyShortcrust always charming the male authors ;) And I missed out on seeing him singing his lungs out saying "I watched flies fuck on channel 11". Go, dad! Listening to @alkaline_trio and REALLY wanting to go see them again. This time with my dad. I missed out seeing them with him last time... @bethanyeve_ I can't help it, it's hereditary Terribly productive day shopping for tumble dryers and now making mac and cheese #domesticgoddess I freakin love when @bethanyeve_ gets stalked by lovestruck chumps Looking at pictures of beagles because you can't be sad when doing so. Particularly the baby variety. @TedBob will get me through being a grown up member of society with his world class chai lattes Just finished @DebHarkness' A Discovery of Witches. I need more now please! @SarahBirch17 you and blood - hangover = terrible combination at the best of times! You know that Mika song that goes "beagles, you are beautiful"? @bethanyeve_ comes round and in a frenzied Uri Geller impression starts bending my kitchen spoons #inappropriateguestbehaviour Reading this book. The heroine is chucked into an oubliette. Serious stuff. All I can hear is Hoggle saying "Terrible black oubliette!" RT @preschoolgems: "I'm always barely awake." @erin_m_lambert hallow! How are things? Congratulations on passing your test! Poop poop! Xxx Well, new food processor, you may have won the battle but my banana cake will win the war! #Wildlydefiantgesticulating RT @randomhouse: RT @lettersofnote: A beautiful letter of advice from John Steinbeck to his teenage son in 1958: http://t.co/ZKBPNvXq Dog convinced me to buy shoes. Did opt for the more sensible ones though so well done me. 5" inch heels are acceptable for school, right? @Souperpowered At least 11 days without?! New job indeed. Going to be a library assistant. I'm in the market for some specs on a chain... xx Having major shoe dilemma - to buy or not to buy. I'm pretty sure the dog is spurring me on to buy. She's frivolous like that. @lainitaylor Daughter of Smoke and Bone is my new -MakeEveryoneIMeetReadItAndComeBackForCakesAndDiscussion- book. Lovelovelove! @Souperpowered Hello beautiful! I'm good, you? Hair has changed back to black (cue trombones). How are you? Seen any nice moustaches lately? @ZiggyShortcrust Athank you! Scared how this whole adult job thing will work -may need a stiff drink and a sob next time I see all of you! Wonder if I can finish reading Discovery of Witches before I have to stop being a bum and start work on Monday...
