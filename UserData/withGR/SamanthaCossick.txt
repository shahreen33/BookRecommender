It's a horrible situation and I can't believe @TLC hasn't pulled them yet. How does a father justify protecting his sicko son, but not the daughters who were molested? How do you not care enough? #CancelTheDuggars Thank you! ❤️ https://t.co/4r3pRVcAsy I hope you're proud of yourself @TLC - profiting off of confessed child molesters. So classy!
