Packer https://t.co/6bw13qfS5f @WickedDecent None. The CSET framework is similar to our RACE, so I feel good! #SRCL2016 "Argument is the hidden discourse that undergirds all of academia." #SRCL2016 Talk softly and fast to engage kids. #SRCL2016 Students should be tired at the end of the day, not teachers.  #SRCL2016 Prob of prior knowledge is that kids don't know enough stuff, OR the stuff they know isn't *important* in school.  #SRCL2016 If you teach with harder texts, Ss WILL grow more.  #SRCL2016 We've been doing Ss a disservice by giving students too little text and text that's too easy. #SRCL2016 Think aloud a show YOUR thinking- not engaging the class in discussion.  #SRCL2016 https://t.co/A2bIgdCavv Practice thinking aloud throughout your day to practice the skill. @mikeistheschyck Get ready for life narration. #SRCL2016 Think aloud practice results monster that can't feed itself.  #SRCL2016 https://t.co/NRS2oWHHqj When thinking aloud, think about how what you read connects or resolves.  #SRCL2016 Kids can't see what is going on in our expert reading heads, so we MUST make our thinking clear to them. #SRCL2016 "Reading comprehension is thinking guided by print" -Perfetti @conradik #SRCL2016 Use language frames after the Ss have discussion using conversational language. #SRCL2016 Use language frames as help with a ticket out the door- plus repeated exposure to academic language. #SRCL2016 Teaching academic language mostly falls to teachers of grades 4-8. #SRCL2016 Academic language carries the content of school. Ss need to "consume and produce" in this language. #SRCL2016 Ss don't know how to "negotiate the phrasing" of academic language. #SRCL2016 Var. of magnet strategy: here are the 5 words we've talked about, write them in 1 meaningful sentence. #SRCL2016 Summary writing improves both writing quality and reading comprehension. #SRCL2016 Where do I GIVE content to kids and how can that shift to where they give ME the content. #SRCL2016 We only get better at the things we want to get better at if we do those things every day #SRCL2016 Don't take a textless approach to teaching. #SRCL2016 Don't punish kids with writing. #SRCL2016 Creates safety. Lessens the need to "explain away" things in hopes of a good evaluation.#srcl2016 Those coaching forms (like for PALS) are just for the person taking the notes. NOT to give to the teacher they are observing!! #SRCL2016 You learn by failed attempts. #SRCL2016 Think of implementing a before-during-after reading triad for peer coaching. Remember end goal is to increase time spent R/W #SRCL2016 For Ss too work this into the WHY for writers' workshop. #tcrwp #SRCL2016 https://t.co/vtaZxuaEi8 Training is not bad or demeaning. It's just how to execute a specific *thing* for a specific goal.  #SRCL2016 Focus on Tier One core instruction first. Make it the best ever! #SRCL2016 Just changing the balance of time spent reading and writing in school will increase results. #SRCL2016 Admin must support instructional change. #SRCL2016 Peer coaching is when we let colleagues watch us try something new.  #SRCL2016 Peer coaching let's us be in a hundred places at once. #SRCL2016 Observation and feedback are powerful to deepen understanding, but people don't like it. So how do we change that perspective? #SRCL2016 In middle school, achievement takes EVERYBODY because kids are affected by everybody. #SRCL2016 PALS is classroom music. #SRCL2016 Note to self: The power of 212. #SRCL2016 For everyone- staff and Ss- your definition for what you want to see MUST be CLEAR. #SRCL2016 Not just for Ts , but think about how to create short term wins for Ss.  #SRCL2016 When you are SICK AND TIRED of saying it, that's when people are hearing it for the first time.  #SRCL2016 To create urgency, connect it to the kids. Numbers don't bleed. @CaryRiches #SRCL2016 @infin8dawg I think I maybe should have been a used car salesman... What do we WANT to see happen everyday? I want to see kids engaged in reading,writing, and discussing their passions #SRCL2016 WHO is doing the reading, writing, and talking? It MUST be the students. #SRCL2016 If scores plateau or go down, that is a Tier One instruction issue. #SRCL2016 The bell curve is for random events. Purposeful instruction should not end up as a bell curve. @CaryRiches #SRCL2016 Identify problem and establish a sense of urgency to establish you PL purpose #SRCL2016 For buy-in to happen, there has to be TRUST in your leadership #SRCL2016 "Change is situational." @caryriches #srcl2016 Interesting thought- building Infrastructure for choice PD #SRCL2016 Wrong #!

Need to add back as RTI classes. #aplitchat @bawhinnem + lrning basics is elem by mdle/high we delve into thinking abt reading.

More freedom to choose what science/history/lit/writing they want to explore #ecet2 2/2 @brookster29 #anythingispossible but the standards make choice too difficult.
