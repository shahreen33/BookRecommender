Esp if they just got together at the end of the first book! @WriteAsRain_ conflict doesn't have to be with the main couple. There can be outside obstacles that challenge them but they work together @goreadabookblog would love for that to be the case more often! @Kat_thebooknerd don't have to agree! I just wish it wasn't always that way @Kat_thebooknerd there is plenty of other things keeping the plot moving @Kat_thebooknerd I'm not saying no arguments, but typically the couple is at odds or separated for whole books. It's annoying. Plus @crys_leach yeah, it was more of a rhetorical question because I get that, but dramatics can be elsewhere with a fantasy series @Kat_thebooknerd would like something different. Something so shippable because they are a team! @Kat_thebooknerd but how often does that happen? Conflict between couples happens in nearly every 2nd and/or 3rd book in a fantasy series I'd love to see more of that, that's all. In a series especially. Don't they realize so many of us read for swoon, and of everything else is crazy, just have a freaking cute and supportive couple?! Why do authors - esp fantasy - feel the need to have their couples separate and/or fight later in the series? Why can't they just BE? @Irisheyz77 @IsaBookSoulmate @laurayjames it's a cute book! Liked Chapel Wars too!

It's hard sometimes lol @NovaBlogder I am shaking!! I should have just stayed away @xoxoKellyNina but you have multiple messages when you directly call out people for not liking triangles @xoxoKellyNina so now you agree you are shaming readers like me? That doesn't mean I can't hate reading about it! That I want OTP and HEA in my books. Want to talk about real life? I am freaking DIVORCED. And guess what? I want to marry again! So this is happening in my own life! @xoxoKellyNina offended. That bit tho... Takes it too far. It just hurt to read that @xoxoKellyNina I understand the main thread of your post and it's fine, I might disagree with your feelings but I wouldn't have been @xoxoKellyNina the line of slut-shaming." @xoxoKellyNina "I find the abhorrence of love triangles and ship switching to be really immature, short-sighted and truly crosses @xoxoKellyNina but I'm being made fun of for my preferences. @xoxoKellyNina my point is that I don't care if it's realistic. There are things I like to read and things I don't. Just like ANY reader @xoxoKellyNina girl you are calling me immature, slut shamer, and short sighted because I hate reading about triangles @LizzieSarcastic @xoxoKellyNina but why shame me because I don't want to read a book with that? Do you read everything because "it's life"? *offended But then I'm insulted for my own preferences and told not to be offensive. Peace the fuck out. This is why I don't want to blog anymore. This community is so damn hypocritical and judgmental and drama-fueled. I can read what I like @noBSbrBlog but why belittle other people in the process? I have never called anyone who loves triangles any sort of name. @noBSbrBlog to take it @noBSbrBlog if you have to say "no offense" there's a chance people are going to be offended. Name calling was used. Don't know how else @disquietus miss youuuu!!! 💛💛 @noBSbrBlog there is no one named of course, but it directly says that if one avoids triangles like the plague then we are immature @noBSbrBlog allowed to be hurt? @noBSbrBlog except it is an attack if I'm called immature and a slut shamer because I don't like to read love triangles. :/ why am I not @katiesbookblog The Sun is Also a Star I'll just leave this here. https://t.co/Qu5JRbsyBz ARC Review: The Boy Most Likely To https://t.co/WBB75Yveod #LoveatFirstPageArchives It's a Fairy Tale Life: Sarah Ockler Interview + Giveaway https://t.co/ILtJRpBkrB #LoveatFirstPageArchives Summer of Series: Fran Wilde Interview + Giveaway! https://t.co/ZVoVLMULC3 #LoveatFirstPageArchives @cupcakegirly okay!

I haven't read this much in a while. :D @andiABCs @jnikkir I was about to say - it'd be like our version of time out :D @rosecoballoway MY FAVORITE. &lt;3 &lt;3 @book_junkee if you're a lunatic, I'm a lunatic. Embrace it :D @crys_leach xo &lt;3 @morganameridius whyyyy are there so many? haha. @morganameridius noooo we just get all the other Chris's okay? :) @morganameridius I hope so! haha @crys_leach mine too! A Week of Mondays has me terrified about triangle possibilities. Someone needs to vet it for me :P @rosecoballoway Love you too, lady! &lt;3 @morganameridius I forgot that your husband's name is Chris. This just brings more hilarity to our FMK this morning 😂 @crys_leach I got a few pretties myself! Gilded Cage has me drooling atm &lt;3 I saw these books and immediately added them to my Goodreads shelves: https://t.co/AdtfdzDAYw @crys_leach I do too! I feel like I'm very up front about my pickiness. @mizgillianberry haha more like, Danielle's gonna burn this with fire. :D @RachelllRaeee hurt anyone's feelings, which is why I don't want to get too comfortable with an author (even tho that can be hard too) @RachelllRaeee I don't see the point in lying about how I feel about a book. It defeats the purpose of my blog. That said I don't want to @mizgillianberry If only my reading life was THAT great :D @mizgillianberry and I think we all have trusted bloggers whose reviews we trust or whose tastes align with ours. Nothing wrong with that! @literaryetc that's something that definitely rubs me the wrong way. I just don't see the point in reviewing for that purpose. @crys_leach same with me and reviewing a book with a love triangle LOL @mizgillianberry (and I know there's a difference between reviewing only 4 and 5 star books, and actually rating EVERY BOOK OMG 5 stars lol) @mizgillianberry completely agree! @astoldbyfANGIRL their next book, and I don't want to hurt anyone but I have to be honest. (sorry for the rant) @astoldbyfANGIRL on the flip side, I love telling them that I love their book! It's a hard balance. Because that doesn't mean I'll like @astoldbyfANGIRL book doesn't seem like such a huge deal, because she's so popular, but befriending other authors seems risky. @astoldbyfANGIRL it makes me suuuuper nervous, especially if they follow me back. things like tweeting, say, Marissa Meyer that I loved her @crys_leach yes exactly! it's nothing personal, but I need a different sort of opinion. @mizgillianberry them, but I might not trust their reviews as much. @mizgillianberry close with. But it's the same principle for someone who always gives 5 stars. Doesn't mean I don't like them or respect @mizgillianberry I was thinking about mentioning that as well. And it's not like I can think of all these bloggers and what authors they are @tonyaleeh will someone really be honest if they're THAT close with the author? . @CindyisWriting thank you! that means a lot! I try to be honest, I WANT to be honest. Otherwise I don't get the point! @Kris10MFAF @CarinaOlsen ditto! xoxo @Kris10MFAF @CarinaOlsen I was just about to say - I know you are always honest, C! &amp; so nice about it. I know I can trust you're being fair @Bookz4Nerdz @bookaddictguide @Chasm_of_Books I know! I'm so very excited :D @bookaddictguide @Bookz4Nerdz @Chasm_of_Books AGREED. And did you see Dan is getting his own book?! @MiaSiegert @YAIndulgences authors have feelings too! I totally get that. I would want the same. &amp; I don't want to hurt anyone as a blogger! @Kris10MFAF thank you &lt;3 &lt;3 I try to be honest about it :D (let's face it, I do more than try haha) @MiaSiegert &lt;3 &lt;3 I didn't peg you for a psycho :) @Kris10MFAF But I have ALWAYS respected your reviews, Kristen! @Kris10MFAF when I see bloggers always chatting with authors, it makes me weary. Combined if they give a lot of favorable reviews @Kris10MFAF I have those too! And that's what I meant - there's different reasons for why we may not trust someone's review. But admittedly @MiaSiegert just like WANT IMMEDIATELY. MUST TELL AUTHOR ABOUT MY EXCITEMENT. @MiaSiegert *hugs* I appreciate it! I always try to be careful when I engage with an author for the first time, but with your book I was @Kris10MFAF I can't even think of who you'd be talking about, so maybe you'd be okay? Haha. But at least you get where I'm coming from! just think that the author/blogger line has been crossed farther than that with others, and so I just can't trust those reviews. believe me I get that. There are certain authors I do like to support. BUT. I always try to be honest in my reviews, I can't NOT be. And I And I'm sure there are authors you could point to and say, "Danielle, I see you talk to her! I don't think I can trust your opinion" and ^^ That was a little confusing. I mean, if you're looking for reviews for MM's books, you may not trust mine because you know I'm a HUGE fan unbiased. I get it. I follow A LOT of authors on Twitter, &amp; talk to many of them. I love doing it. But I do worry about those "consequences" make the case not to trust MY reviews because I hate love triangles. Or you know I'm a huge Melina Marchetta fan and you want someone more you! It's okay. You can support them! It's your blog and your reviews. But I'm weary to trust those 5 stars. The thing is though, you can 3) Sorry guys, but there are reviews out there I DO NOT TRUST because I've noticed you're really friendly with the author. I'm NOT blaming nicer because I'm friendly with them? To me, that's not right. It's a very strange dynamic that's been created because of social media. afraid to share my opinion, especially if they follow me on Twitter. And if they unfollow me? Makes me feel like shit. Do I make my review able to in the past. 2) That being said, I feel like crap if I read a book, have talked with the author, and don't like his/her book. I'm love being able to ask them questions (like stand alone? series? etc). It's a great way to connect with authors in a way we haven't been My thoughts on author-blogger friendships: 1) I LOVE chatting with authors on Twitter. I love letting them know that I loved their book. I @Annaberry_Reads ohhh Angelfall would be a great series to binge!
