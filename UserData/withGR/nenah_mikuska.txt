If living abroad has taught me one thing, it is that I absolutely have no idea how to cook. 1.6k words into an essay and realizing you are totally screwed #lordhelpus I have never dealt with such incompetence as I have with the FinAid office.

I want to learn, not be a statistic. Rather, let me travel the world and learn from experience, read the books which spark my interest, and gather my thoughts from that. I'm suddenly very frustrated with the educational system that cares only abou the marks I get on a test, rather than what I learn.
