I cannot stand her manipulating ass. I men all these men in the Tudors deserve to be stabbed in the neck and privates. All of them. I HATE ALL THE MEN in The Tudors. I have never seen such dishonest, disgusting, hypocritical liars and the way they treat women is shameful. So yes I'm in SOA withdrawals, but I finally found something else to binge watch...The Tudors. Charlie's walk alone should've garnered some awards. That walk was something amazing. The character development on SOA was amazing. As a viewer and a writer I appreciated it and was continually impressed. How Charlie didn't win multiple awards for his portrayal of Jax Teller is beyond me. He did the damn thing. A few days ago I finished my binge watching of Sons of Anarchy.

Also if head coverings and people speaking another language have you that damn scared you need to examine your damn self. Because if you take the time to look and stop being a hypocrite you will see you are not even following what you supposedly follow.

So kindly, sit down, shut up and leave people alone that wear head coverings you fake ass Christians. So, if you subscribe to keeping the Old Testament ways, you too should be wearing a head covering. Yes. Just like the people you persecute. That passage of scripture talks about when a woman should have her head covered. Now this comes from the Christian bible. 1 Corinthians 11:3-16. Read it. And let me drop some knowledge on these people who supposedly call themselves Christian while persecuting people about covering their head. Why is it okay for the KKK to wear hoods and no one says shit but if a brown person has a head covering it is a problem? @Delta The way you handled this was completely unacceptable.
