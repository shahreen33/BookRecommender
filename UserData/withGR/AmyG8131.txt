Doing nothing today. I have done nothing but watch TV, sleep, and never left the house today. I still had to take a shower and put on fresh PJs. No slob here üòÅ I think #NoTomorrow is super cute and I can't stop watching. I am really liking this show. I mean this dude looks and sounds like he is in romance novel. I could get past crazy part too, üòÅ. #NoTomorrow I had to watch the new Anne movie. I couldn't resist b/c I have always felt Anne Shirley is a kindred spirit. #anneofgreengables I just stayed up all night watching Gilmore Girls.
