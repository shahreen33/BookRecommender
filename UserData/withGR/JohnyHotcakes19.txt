Marked as to-read: Luckiest Girl Alive by Jessica Knoll http://t.co/DTjb44R2ur As far as I'm concerned with everything that's going on. Especially this past weekend. I have no brother. He can go to hell. Jesus. Two people I know have died in the last few days. All I can think is who's next to complete this cycle of 3. People on the train are the worst today.
