Also about the movie it seemed long and drawn out not as action packed as the book seemed Of course things were changed @laurieesc I didn't mind the last book though it was slow in a lot of parts. I understood why she had to go, she wouldn't have been happy .. @laurieesc why is that is it because of what happens to Tris? @laurieesc True I can see that. Did you hear they plan to split the last book into two movies? Have you read all the books? @laurieesc What disappointed you most I suppose? @laurieesc Can you explain? I know they changed some things and twisted the ending again... which they seem to be doing in a lot of movies @laurieesc you didn't like it? @NaNoWordSprints 75% of a page done this time @NaNoWordSprints A little over a page done.
