I read an article about revision. I've had enough reviews to let me know I'm not a perfect writer. Asked to revise is a good thing. The Voice Within is fleshing out. Poor Lyric and Raphael, between his problems, and her enemies... they really have the screws put to them. Ah... outlines... How I have missed thee. I miss the adventures of my Goddesses and know i'll get back to them one day. My mind is filled with angels and demons these days. Why am I tweeting my own horn?  Read Divine Touch - book 1- and find out!! http://tiny.cc/q1h7h The thing I loved best about writing Divine Touch was Kate. She is such a dynamic character who talks to herself.  http://tiny.cc/q1h7h Bitten by books gave it 3 tombstones and says 'Bock is good with the red herrings.'  http://tiny.cc/q1h7h From Fictionwise - 3 great ratings, 2 good, 2 ok. Anytime someone takes the time to review my book is lovely to me!! http://tiny.cc/q1h7h PNR says This is an author to watch for and a series to put in your 'read over and over again' pile. http://tiny.cc/q1h7h Coffeetime says A fun read, full of fast-paced dialogue and clever repartee... Divine Touch was a true pleasure to read http://tiny.cc/q1h7h Got Romance Review says - I would highly recommend this book and I'm anticipating continuing the series. http://tiny.cc/q1h7h Get your Goddess on.... http://tiny.cc/q1h7h The one that started it all @BooksDevoured  You can tell alot about a person by how they drink their tea ;) Great to meet you!! I love thick ice tea glasses that look like short stumpy wine glasses. I'm sophisticated with my sweet ice tea. @meganrecords I read this awhile ago, and it stuck with me. It would make me think someone was yelling at me! @meganrecords Don't forget to eat something. I work through lunch all the time, an apple is a great paperweight. Looks and tastes great. @deeshore  I don't think I'm dull - though my sense of humor sure isn't for everyone lollll @deeshore  Lolllll you so have that right! Thanks for that!! needed a reminder. Today I'm working on the bad girl for The Voice Within. I'm focused on her walk  - can't get it right. Ugh. Why can't I be normal. @meganrecords Have pondered this as well! @JulieALindsey  love the #askeditor tweet. Made me giggle. (I completely understand that #queryfail lol I lost the stars but not the sparkle. It's funny how I went into writing with dazzling plans, and stayed in it because of the drive. I think its going to be hard for 2011 to top 2010 ... but please feel free to try! The writing, the waiting, the editing.. I can handle that. Reviews? They give me ulcers. lol Take a step back in time http://exm.nr/f7WaWf @meganrecords That's sweet - saves on the holiday melodrama! This is my second angel book. The first was softer, pure, and clear.  The second book is dark, violent, and biting.  Weird. #FF @drcydrke @meganrecords @staceyigraham @lindsayfaber @deeshore @madmumbler @drcydrke Thanks Darcy - appreciate it!! Always good to have new followers! @meganrecords I love that answer, and thank you for the other answer as well, that's more what was looking to learn. #askeditor Is there a specific genre that seems to be opening up? #askeditor @staceyigraham ROFL. If it works let me know, I will even learn how to bake! #askeditor @meganrecords @staceyigraham See not long at all!! Good Luck! #askeditor @staceyigraham To you as well. @staceyigraham I think that's an excellent visual. I think mine is on a scale being weighed. lol I look forward to the warroom! #askeditor @staceyigraham What's the war room? My mind is coming up with all sorts of oddities. #askeditor @drcydrke I love the supernatural. I have goddess books with werewolves vampires and soul reapers. Have an angel series in the works. @drcydrke with you there - vampires are not my cup of tea. I'm partial to angels these days #askeditor @lindseyfaber  The pleasure is mine, I assure you. I'm always interested in broadening my thimble of knowledge. #askeditor loving the dialogue @ #askeditor  Hi and thank you  for the tips!

Is there more to life than this? And note to self: need new bed. I now have a harlequin rejection letter, form style, and the book is too short for the other pubs, I want it in print... what to do... @techhie I'm surprised 53% of Americans know the difference @sharoncullen Great review, I love doing reviews for PNR, you should stop by the haunt one day :) @booksamillion Good Morning BAM!! @WritingSpirit I'd never seen a chat on twitter before, this is neat, glad I had you on here :) #writechat @WritingSpirit They are great, I'm blessed.  I've never thought about trying to get an agent, probably should one day #writechat @WritingSpirit isn't that the truth, I even make my sisters call me so I can answer in character. They accept my weird #writechat @WritingSpirit I have to have music really loud, generally deep forest or enigma, I "act out' scenes... my neighbors think i'm so weird I need to stop coloring on the wall like a 3  year old when I'm working out an idea in my head Hi! :) #writechat WIP quote. “You are an incredibly stupid man to hold on to the memory of a woman who didn't love you enough to love you forever.” @sharoncullen those little easter peanut butter cups are my weakness, I can eat a whole bag. @sharoncullen the trick is to buy yourself the richest, most decadent chocolate you can find, so rich you can only have a taste instead @sharoncullen I started the next one last night, I'm starting chapter three. Thats what my post was about, that i can write again lol @sharoncullen I finished it weeks ago, It really took me a long time to get over being finished. I got depressed and didn't let go lol @ianracey I'm so dense sometimes, I read that and thought, those are impossible football scores. I'm such an American. It appears I can write again!

What do you think of a romance book consisting of 4-5 couples, linked by a church showing different ways to overcome divorce? Potential? My infatuation with John Mayer is out of hand, his music gives me headaches, he's not attractive, but I love the words, his songs are poems Ok, work is done, mood is infinitely better, I will just ignore the comment that bothered me. Like my new blog? http://tiny.cc/kdb597 My ego is bruised, why can't someone just say 'I don't like this kind of thing' instead of bashing it? Mean people suck, and I still like it @DianaCastilleja Thanks, I used to run the storyline for a RPG game,  I went from Being a Goddess to writing about them. lol @DianaCastilleja I understand, www.kristybock.com is mine, I'm forever doodling with it, it needs a full overhaul lol @DianaCastilleja new on is *hottt!!* great job!! @DianaCastilleja SURE! @DianaCastilleja I think that's a great idea! i just beg people from the Haunt to go look at mine when I make changes lol @DianaCastilleja WOOHOO!!

Anderson Cooper is too hot to be on TV, who listens to a word he says? Too busy thinking naughty thoughts! @ToxicTaco you on yahoo? Totally laughing over two toddlers and one jar of fluff... and one is naked! Oh wow... I forgot how funny that picture was. @HighlandPress Happy St. Patrick's Day!! has outlined 4 shorts of already married couples revitalizing their marriages, through love and faith. I must have marriage on the brain. Dear Ms Bock Your son has invented 83 illnesses since the beginning of the year, While his imagination is wonderful, he needs to stop. Her: Mom, I like your new pants Me: I don't, Her: Why? Me: I'm not a plumber Her: Mom everyone knows you just don't bend down in pant. WHAT? @MarkStevenBrown because I want it to deal with some aspect of the writing @MarkStevenBrown new blog idea, I already have blogs I'm so incredibly sick of Lady Gaga, she's probably a fine artist, but if I hear her song once more, my brain will explode, and i'll die. I'm astounded at how insecure I can feel some days, I read something I wrote a while back and just shredded it with my criticisms, neurotic @MiceCast I sure did!! @sharoncullen I think it tells you that she doesn't want you to worry if you heard about it somewhere else @booksamillion YaY, I love the Maximum Ride Series @RickRReed Fabulous review!! I can't get my blog to work the way I want to, so I need a new blogging idea, any suggestions? @mmcbryar OMG I had the same backup plan! I even have extra supplies! In my next life I'm going to write a book on how to survive teenage daughters. I'm not sure i'll survive this one to write about it. Him:when I grow up i want to marry you. Me: you can't marry your mother, him: I can if I want to, Me: I don't want to marry you him: no fair outlined second Goddess book, wrote 2k words for inspirational short Womanless beauty pageant... fantastic!! Had the best time it's Pi day!! He's an English professor, goes to church, never been married, likes similar things as i do, and wants to date me... somethings wrong w/ him My niece said: kids are hiding from me aunt kissy so I called them, they came when i called, she said 'i find you!' hide and seek w/ a 3yr. OMG... gross... turkey hot dogs... do *not* taste like regular hot dogs!!! i can't believe my kids eat those disgusting things. My niece just told me that I was pink like a banana, then hit my son... God, I love that kid. My child has no privacy, when her moms best friend works at the school. She got sent to the principals office and didn't tell me! @MarkStevenBrown would be nice lol Have a great night :) My mind is being very naughty indeed. I should go to bed before I get myself into trouble. @joliecain Thank's for following :) Work is done... for the time being! &lt;3 @authorsara Yay! Can't wait to have you back at the Haunt!! Revisions written, edits done. Now I'm too nervous to send, someone shoot me and put me out of my misery. @marcnobbs And to think, all that time, I could have been having fun, instead of selling cookies!?! @marcnobbs have some girlscout ones, choco thin mints you can have, bought too many of the darn things! @rowenacherry Rowena, I just want to say, you are one of the politest people I've ever met, everywhere I've seen you, you are always lovely Me: Why are 8th graders smoking Her: their mom didn't tell them to wait until tenth grade Me: Neither did yours! Her: I can smoke now? @austingirl tell her sorry but you can vote, drive, and own property now, the social matriarchs dress code no longer applies Sometimes I just crave red meat, so much so that I dream of it... I think I was a vampire in another life. @MarkStevenBrown TY! 3 ambitions, 1 content, 1 said they want both (doesn't everyone?) @jacquierogers me too, I would choose ambition over content, content just leads to complacency @MarkStevenBrown lol I'm sure plenty of people have both, but one will rank higher on the list of important qualities, which one? Question of the day: Which is more important to you in a partner, to be ambitious or to be content? I should have went back to bed the moment the bottom fell out of my coffee cup. Definite sign of things to come. @jacquierogers Thank you so much :) I'm excited First Draft is FINISHED!!! Her: What does skulled mean? Me: scald or skull? Her: Scald, Me: burn with hot water, her: why would you scald a cat? (she meant scold) Work is done, send revised short through critique loop, because lord knows I am blind when it comes things like commas and grammar @MarkStevenBrown set the alarm to get up before she does Good Morning, Today my youngest told me I was almost as beautiful as his teacher, but that he loved me more because I cooked for him. Update: My son is clean, and smells like his man soap. I have to buy man soap, like speedstick or axe, for two boys, six and seven. LOL! me: You need  a shower, you stink. him: I don't stink enough yet. Me: Go, I can smell you from here. Him: You can't smell me from outside woke up, feel less like death warmed over, have the scenes written out, but now I'm not quite sure if thats what was meant... UGH! Him: Its disgusting, Me: Man up, its just medicine, Him: I'm six, I'm not a man yet. Me (can't talk laughing now) I'm surprised my child has hair left. From natural blonde, to purple to stripped to brown in just three weeks. Lord save me from Teenagers @marcnobbs You can do it!! *claps for Marc* Get to writing!! 4 scenes down, 12 to go .... small scenes are fun @mark_henry Sounds like a successful day! Good job! anyone else totally messed up by the spring ahead?? thinks you can write on the tip of a pin what I actually know about writing. I lost my pencil, looked for it, searched hi and low. I got annoyed, irritated and downright angry that I lost my pencil that was in my hair and then get called into work... life amuses me @mark_henry Have a wonderful signing :) I survived the night, the coffee is made, time to get to work on scenes @jacquierogers I think I could too, its so weird that something has that much power My endless shift has ended, I'm going to bed, for some reason tonight I really miss smoking and I quit like six months ago. omg will this shift never end????? I can't seem to set up this blog and have my Godddess's as contributors... wordpress is not cooperating, wonder if blogger is better lol Lou, not on facebook, on twitter... that sends to facebook 33 MINUTES INTO WORK AND I'VE BEEN REPRIMANDED, THAT SURE SET THE TONE FOR THE EVENING.

My mind is going in 1000 directions and i just started lol I took a nap, woke up, read emails and really really really wish I didn't have to work, I want to get started fixing my story! I need a nap, Book 2, is untitled, but 5 chapters strong! bb later after i wake up. Someone said finding a critique partner is harder than finding a husband, apparently I fail at both. I wish I was one of those people who felt better after exercise @jesicac I want pictures! @rebeccajvickery HAHA it amazes me how much that one little cup of coffee (or tea) means in the morning! I can give an 80's B movie Zombie a run for it's money as I stumble around making coffee - Good Morning! Jes i want pictures. going to bed... bye! @jacquierogers hahhaah we're a pair! we just need Deborah to say her mouse is jumping, and we've created a big ole mess @LeanneBurroughs Yay, I'm like the dorky 15 year old who yells out, looky I have friends now!! My thesaurus is broken, it isn't giving me the right word. see, I did remember my password after all rofl @jacquierogers I just redid my page not too long ago, I like it for now, I'm thinking of redoing my whole website though @jacquierogers Yay!!
