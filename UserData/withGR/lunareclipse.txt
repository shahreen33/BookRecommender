If you see it, Friday's Vienna Choc Chunk is fantastic. @fizleglitz that totally does, and you are prob eating healthier than me, as our meals usually consist of mac and chs. :p @fizleglitz true, but their selection was lacking, but getting better. @fizleglitz also am surprised how well mom took this choice. She terms it as "the no meat thing", but I expected more hassle from her. @fizleglitz yeah, Giant has a pretty decent selection, but I wouldn't mind a better store coming into York. @fizleglitz right on! @fizleglitz heh thanks. are meals are slightly smaller now, but it saves room for the ice cream. @mandy_marvelous @fizleglitz  I just got done eating coffee ice cream. @fizleglitz Yeah, it's something I had thought about for a long time, but wasn't actually sure what I would eat... as silly as that sounds. @mandy_marvelous except for the manure that your food eats. :) @fizleglitz glad to bring someone else over to the perv side. @fizleglitz yep not for health, would have given up cigs a long time ago for that. @fizleglitz OMG, goldfish, zebra & giraffe, I'm such a Tool. @fizleglitz :D thanks, you are a cute meat eater. Am I the only one that is giggling at the "meat eater"? @mandy_marvelous lol, except for the green hue on my skin I would have to agree. @fizleglitz Didn't want to be part of it. BUT I live vicariously through @czarphanguye, who still enjoys eating meat. @fizleglitz I watched a documentary and then further research on the way animals are treated. Continued as this is a lengthy convo. @fizleglitz nope this is zebra & giraffe http://www.zebraandgiraffe.co.za/home.html @fizleglitz Awesome, Fort Knox from Goldfish is awesome! Zebra and Giraffe are a little darker... @fizleglitz I don't either, but a coworker & I got into an argument how I was wrong. Idc that he ate meat, but he cared that I didn't. @mandy_marvelous lol well I still remember how delicious it was :p @fizleglitz Zebra and Giraffe are alternative rock. @fizleglitz well I withdraw Goldfish and Supreme Beings of Leisure as I don't consider them electonica, but they technically are.. Why do meat eaters get upset over vegetarians? @fizleglitz I love the band Goldfish, Zebra & Giraffe, and Supreme Beings of Leisure. Dayum! Morningstar makes some fantastic veggie burgers. Belly is nice and full. @czarphanguye haha, yes. :p @fizleglitz that is a great picture Lauren. :) I have been hoping that classes would be cancelled due to the heat (just so I wouldn't have to go), but it hasn't happened yet.
