(1/2) @thatsostelle you're welcome! @thatsostelle the one I use is for oily skin but urban decay has setting spray for all skin types. @thatsostelle I like Urban Decay's De-Slick setting spray @thatsostelle I do use it. It really helps to keep makeup from running especially if it's hot, or if you're like me &amp; have oily skin. @thatsostelle I usually don't, just moisturizer and BB cream.

If you're into road trip themed books, I say go with that one! @AmeDyckman sounds like a plan to me! So I hopped on the bandwagon and created an Amazon wish list? Should I post it? #OTSPSecretSister @purply_gurply I was always a big Jem fan! I was also a big fan of classic Nick cartoons, like Doug @YouBookMe @purply_gurply Yes! Daria!!!! @andithebookworm also some special events - like the smack down which all the authors participate in. They pay different games,etc @andithebookworm panels featuring  different authors talking about different things. Also all the authors sign books throughout the day @StefaniSloma I don't journal but I love journals/notebooks. Lined b/c without lines my writing is all sorts or crooked #OTSPSecretSister @trippingbooks so your SS wrote back? Did you reveal yourself? I love the idea of a pen pal! @miss_print @andiABCs @whatsarahread I think I say "with me" Want to send my #OTSPSecretSister a letter, but not sure what to say. Especially since I'm not sure i'm going to reveal myself. Suggestions? @StefaniSloma I love them too! It's a great way to discover new music. And I'm with you - no country #OTSPSecretSister @JuliWyant you raise a very good point! @JuliWyant @andiABCs starting to feel like I'm the only one who gets excited &amp; runs out to get her fave band/musicians new CD ha ha On page 156 of 240 of When I Was the Greatest, by Jason Reynolds http://t.co/dNHagwq4y9 How do you all feel about mix CDs? #OTSPSecretSister @serenareads13 panera bread, Wendy's, and being from NJ I love a good diner! #OTSPSecretSister @YAFantasyFan too many faves! But if I had  to pick 1 it's To Kill a Mockingbird. I love character driven novels #OTSPSecretSister @darkangel231988 @rebekahrendo @galsonthesamepg I say yes too! #OTSPSecretSister @bookchic13 no I generally do the same thing #OTSPSecretSister @OUAC_Stephanie I'm open to a book not on a wish list. I plan on giving books on the wish list &amp; some I think she'll like #OTSPSecretSister @SaraMStuart @bookchic13 same here, wouldn't be offended, just not the gift for me. #OTSPSecretSister @lifeofbookenthu Mermaids! And of course unicorns #OTSPSecretSister RT @miss_print: Thirty hours left to win an ARC of #ACOTAR on my blog: https://t.co/MGoyOniZDH @BetweenDPages it's like a sticker that says "this book belongs to..." Then you write in your name #OTSPSecretSister @amshuman @YouBookMe no contest, a League of Their Own is my fave sports movies! #OTSPSecretSister @iwotfm definitely not! Coloring is fun for any age! #OTSPSecretSister @darkangel231988 yes! I think it's fine as long as it's something you think your sister would like. #OTSPSecretSister @bookishfeminist as much as I love them, I'd pass because I have one too many already #OTSPSecretSister @SaraMStuart yes! I think any kind of stationary is a great gift! #OTSPSecretSister @andithebookworm  check out @BookOutletcom Okay, so what would be some bookish items (besides books obvs) that you'd like to see? Bookmarks? Book plates? Swag? #OTSPSecretSister @amshuman I'm not a sports fan at all.  But I do love a good sports themed movie! #OTSPSecretSister @ohloveyourflaws Tote bags and reusable bags are great! Personally I feel like one could never have enough! #OTSPSecretSister @BetweenDPages I love UK editions as long as the covers are vastly different than the U.S. Editions. #OTSPSecretSister @iwotfm honestly I kind of want to know at the beginning! But I feel I'm the only 1 who feels that way ha ha #OTSPSecretSister @lifeofbookenthu if I own 1 book in series &amp; it's HC I'd want HC to match.if it's a new series &amp; I don't own any pb is ok #OTSPSecretSister @BetweenDPages I don't think so. I only have a goodreads wish list. #OTSPSecretSister
