RAWR. @mrevanwatkins you're slow. In other news, I'm hungry. Waiting for someone to tell me to do something so I can tell them it's not my division. Then I can consider myself a proper fan. Like, NO IT'S NOT! IT'S NOT OKAY! and THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO! are my standard lines for like everything. I've been part of the Sherlock fandom for a like a month and it has already overtaken my life.

Not appreciative of this situation. #lazytweet I'm Sherlock Holmes and I work alone because no one can compete with my MASSIVE INTELLECT! But getting out of bed is difficult. Unlikely. Maybe. Maybe if I can just manage to stay away from fanfiction there is hope I can get this done. Oh no... I ended up on Twitter. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HOMEWORK. @bfaythe So true. We drive metaphorical knives into our hearts every day and manage to convince ourselves that we enjoy it. WHAT IS THIS? @bfaythe Well that explains a lot. Because I can feel myself losing my mind. LIKE A NEEDED ANOTHER FANDOM TO GIVE ME FEELS WHAT HAVE I DONE. Crying so hard my brother thinks I'm faking. I can't. I'm done. I can't handle all of these feels. Bawling. Um so I need season 3 now.

Also possibly 25th anniversary Phantom, if I feel the need to reduce myself to a puddle of tears. My brother threw my doughnut. #rude LOVE ALL THE SPIDERS. #yesimweirdiknow Oh my gosh, @emmgang7. The spider is not going to hurt you. #relax #sisterprobs I need the Phantom to come Punjab lasso  some people for me. RT @LitAwkMo: That awkward moment when your aunt makes you sleep in the room your uncle died in. #JaneEyre #CharlotteBronte #TheRedRoom Our love is like a small umbrella in the rain. Yes, we have that in common. That one small thing in common. Though we are not at all alike, you make me feel alive. How can I explain? Inside my heart I feel a pain when you're not there. You make me smile, you make me laugh, you make me care. @TheMaskedAngel and @SwedishSoprano have temporarily stolen my ability to can. Check back with me in an hour or so. #feelings I really need to go to bed but instead I'm singing showtunes. Because logic. And rain will make the flowers grow. And you will keep me safe. And you will keep me close. You're here, that's all I need to know. A little fall of rain can hardly hurt me now. Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius. I don't feel any pain.
