Black lives need protecting. If #AllLivesMatter then why do we value certain lives over others? You're missing the point! RT @marktheshark: Saying #alllivesmatter is ignorant and hurtful. Stop. By saying "all lives matter" in response to #blacklivesmatter shows that you truly have no understanding or respect for pain or struggle. Black lives are under attack, that's why we're focusing on helping this specific group. All it's saying is that these lives need immediate attention. So, why can't you see that? So why can't we get that saying "black lives matter" doesn't equate "ONLY black lives matter" ? Bc we understand that saying one thing needs more immediate attention than another doesn't disregard other factions. Just like saying "save the Amazon" doesn't mean "and destroy all other rainforests in the meantime". Bc we know that if you say "save the tiger sharks" it doesn't mean, "kill all other sharks".

And ya'll are bitchin about Kim K. FEMALE SEXUALITY DOES NOT EQUATE WEAKNESS, ABUSE REPERCUSSIONS, INSECURITIES, OR A LACK OF SELF RESPECT. You don't have to be a fucking victim to be a confident female. No one had to wrong you for you to be sexually open and unashamed. We've become so much more comfortable labeling women as victims than we are labeling them as in control. Bitches are mad because they're uncomfortable. And they're slut shaming. Kim is a bimbo and her book obviously isn't literature but everyone's only pissed because a woman is sexually confident and unapologetic.
