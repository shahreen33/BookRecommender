But I think it's important to consider the impact this show has had on many other people I guess what I'm trying to say is that I believe the show has done some good, but more bad. To people who like the show, I apologize To the point where Peruvian man committed suicide in the same fashion as Hannah Baker, also leaving behind tapes I will admit that the show has increased awareness for suicide and mental illness, but it has also caused a lot of hurt toward others I could never imagine what they might feel to have their mental illness romanticized. And I choose not to support that I can't put into words how much it saddens me. I don't suffer from mental illness, but people in my life do, and I care greatly for them Promposals inspired by this show, people claiming to want Clay and Hannah's love story, even the announcement of a second season And on top of that, I think it's disgusting that people have romanticized 13 Reasons Why and the mental illness involved Since then, I have not been able to bring myself to watch a show that has so greatly affected one of my friends Having not seen the show, I don't know if that episode had a trigger warning, but I know that a lot of people were affected by it She said that seeing the suicide on screen was a trigger for her - someone who had issues with cutting. And it affected her greatly I had a discussion with a college friend after the show came out. She had seen it and I hadn't, and she told me something I never forgot But the way that suicide was depicted on the show, how realistically they made it to be on screen, is why I can't watch it So many people I know love the show, and I really wanted to give it a shot because I love the book It makes me really sad that after a lot of thought, I've decided not to watch #13ReasonsWhy I just uploaded a new video to @YouTube: Writing Vlog #4 | The Re-Outlining Begins https://t.co/AgNW5ImmhU Writing Vlog #4 | The Re-Outlining Begins: https://t.co/pLp57BokRI via @YouTube I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/pLp57BokRI Writing Vlog #4 | The Re-Outlining Begins The Rebel's Guide to Jealousy and Winning üòÇ Perfect reason to start practicing my manipulating üòâ https://t.co/oxOnbwH1tI I really want to take a nap bc I've been waking up so early these past few days I should be equipped with a flamethrower when living in places that cockroaches frequent On page 67 of 382 of Red Rising, by Pierce Brown: This is not what I expected, but I'm i... https://t.co/6fiEJ1BKTn 3 of 5 stars to The Slaughter Man by Tony Parsons https://t.co/v1QQvitX8u Thanks Facebook, for reminding me that I left HK a year ago and will be doing so again in 10 days https://t.co/08S7HTLi1V 5 of 5 stars to Vicious by V.E.

Stay tuned, I might cry "Why do you write like you're running out of time?" Because NaNoWriMo is over in 22 hours and 49 minutes and I still need 17.3K words Gotta keep telling myself that I can do this.

I was going to chill and catch up with my TV shows over Thanksgiving break, but no, I have 5 papers to write and an exam to study for I have so many papers due after Thanksgiving, I'm basically spending my break writing all kinds of things One of these days, I might just end up rolling off the path because the wind is so strong. Or flying across campus to class The wind is so strong. If it weren't for the wind, I'd be fine. But no, I almost fell while walking to the library because the wind hit me I really want to make more of an effort to journal more through the rest of freshman year, chronicling my time here at Messiah The whole process of journaling just makes me feel calmer, more at peace, and clearer in both my thoughts and feelings a lot through this. Plenty of things that I've realized and learned about myself are from God, through my journaling Literally every time I journal, I process and learn things that I otherwise wouldn't have. And recently, I've learned that God speaks to me Journaled for the first time in 5 months today and it felt really good. Every time I pick it up again, I wonder why I don't do it more @thechumbles IT OPENED AND I ORDERED MY CHICKEN TENDERS. I'M SO HAPPY I almost left my room, but then I remembered that the Union's online ordering opens at 1, so now I'm refreshing their page I've sat down to journal again for the first time in months and it feels so great That moment when two of your college friends call your best guy friend "really cute" &amp; "really hot" while you're Skyping him üòÇüòÇüòÇ Someone help me find our how I can smuggle a puppy into my college dorm room https://t.co/fHpyPkioAU Hannah: "Ooh your hair smells good."

Sorry friends, I didn't mean for that to happen.

I can actually catch up with to the word count goal if I really block out time for this It's felt really nice to just sit in the library, listening to my NaNoWriMo playlist, and writing in a completely uninterrupted space I spent 45 mins walking 3km around my library to find the Blastoise on campus and finally caught it! At least I've walked a ton today One of the biggest things I'm trying to train myself to do is to drink more water. So far, every other day is a day I succeed I think I just lost some respect for the upperclassman who shrieked about "Trump life" and ran off laughing maniacally @emmmabooks my best friend sent me a video of a puppy playing in snow because she knows I've had a hard couple of weeks @BiancaHabana awww yeah it did ‚ù§Ô∏è It started out as a good day, then it got progressively worse. I have no mental or emotional capacity left THIS IS SO CUTE https://t.co/vmFoJsUucO "It's gonna be a good day, and it's in our control. And your day is in your control" - @IISuperwomanII I really needed this today In other news, a Pikachu spawned and I almost had it, but the wifi cut out and it disappeared. Darned college wifi You know you're kind of getting used to the weather when you can leave the dorm in 0 degree weather while wearing yoga pants It's already been a bad start to the week. Sigh. Third week in a row I was ready to go to bed 3 hours ago and I still have stuff to do @BiancaHabana omg no make it stop Me https://t.co/CZQO0gYKTl Suddenly, I really want pho. Legit pho. I'm sad now üò¢ Apparently Lyndon Johnson didn't want Communism to spread from Vietnam to Japan......but Japan is so freaking far from Vietnam???? @BiancaHabana tbh the fact that people still wear Crocs makes me uncomfortable No idea how I'm gonna get all my work done today, but I really need to be able to do it all without procrastinating or breaking down I haven't had this much work due on a single day since before fall break *hides in a corner and cries* @veschwab this is Prince https://t.co/d7KKR6G4Ru @BiancaHabana @slw_97 @a_young75 @yessiecampos143 Heheheh ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/j3asJxbRC7 I have to do homework but I really don't want to. I wish the weekend was longer because then I might actually get stuff done @KristinaHorner "I might go somewhere nice, buy an island or something." - AxiomCharmander I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing squirrels on campus This is the most I've ever struggled with a story during NaNoWriMo. I'm 2 chapters in and hitting writer's block every other day Update: I didn't fall off @slw_97 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/USKMBRJvv1 Moved a bunch of stuff around in my room, so now my bed is significantly elevated. Hopefully I don't fall out of bed tonight @LizMZimm awwww but at least you met him in your dream @BiancaHabana awwwww @BiancaHabana okay but tbh that's 100% the real reason @BiancaHabana is it because boys are dumb and haven't asked you out yet? @LizMZimm but was he still the lovable dork we all know him to be? 3,720 more words until I hit today's word count goal and officially get on track. Might not be able to actually do that though. We'll see Came into the library to study, then a friend came along and attracted more people, and now I can't focus because there are people talking Somehow, I have 12 snap streaks going and the pressure is so real to keep them all alive. How do people do this successfully? The plan for tomorrow is to catch up as much as I can with my NaNo words in between my classes, and then reward myself with a nap Today has been decently productive. Yesterday was better, but I still got a pretty good amount done today Today marks the first of NaNoWriMo that I've actually written at least 1,667 words I wrote 41 words yesterday, but today has been better because I've already written 700+ for #NaNoWriMo2016 PTL that a professor I want next semester is creating another section because someone told the ENTIRE lacrosse team to take her class This is the kind of bouquet I want https://t.co/voIB4ChuCI Might actually need that nap at some point today. Kinda hoping I can do without it though Gonna hang out at the library for a few hours tomorrow to stock up on my Pok√©balls because I'm completely out @yessiecampos143 @danisnotonfire mine too I've been really productive today and I want this to continue for the rest of the week because I could actually get so much done I feel so bad for laughing, but this has been the first half of my week üòÇ https://t.co/lWcycWl4wu @yessiecampos143 when the baes have an event called DAPGOOSE and it makes you want to go even more https://t.co/2yChHlsc41 I might actually just fall asleep, even though I don'f have the luxury of doing that right now Legit, college makes it so hard to find time, and it's only been 1 day Day 1 of NaNoWriMo consisted of 333 words and nothing else. Let's hope tomorrow is better because this is the first time I'm already behind Oral Comm today consisted of stealing a vacuum, crawling on the floor like a toddler, and having my friend almost high-five my face Legit though https://t.co/6CJW68UvgV *laughs nervously because it's the first day of NaNoWriMo and I haven't written yet* @a_young75 when the hunger strikes after I brush my teeth, I cry a little on the inside Kinda surprised that I'm not panicking about NaNoWriMo but then again, that would require energy Why do I have to be up in 5 hours and do responsible college student things? Also, I'm hungry Halloween was totally worth it because I got a selfie with the cute RA and made him laugh üòä I'm so out of it, I just got an appointment mixed up. Luckily it's next week, so it's all good @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHAHAHA What really confuses me about Tinder is when guys' bios say "I'm 6'6" and I'm like, are you really though? It's been over 2 months and I still accidentally flip the wrong light switch in my dorm room I don't understand how this kept people entertained for such a long time. I've had my share of good and bad conversation, and now I'm done I've had Tinder and Bumble for about 14 hours and I'm pretty much done with both of them I'm a little too amused by Tinder There's an assignment that I legit don't know how to complete because writing a summary of a willing disagreement is kind of strange One of the best parts was when we found a guy from our college that we're pretty sure we've seen before Spent an hour looking through Tinder with my friend. We laughed till the point of tears and now I'm legit considering a profile for fun It has been a very interesting day. A great day, but also a very interesting one You know what's sad? I know at least 4 cute boys who live on the second floor of my dorm, and I live on the third üò≠ Just 13 more hours until I'm done for the week. Just make it through 13 more hours For a moment, I contemplated running halfway across campus for a Pokemon lure at the library, but I'm too lazy for that SO CLOSE TO GETTING AN A ON MY NEXT PHILOSOPHY EXAM OKAY I hate those Snapchat ads because one just lowkey scared me while I was in public with a freaking horror movie ad. Go die in a hole pls @BiancaHabana you know what I'm proud of though? Hayden and I haven't lost our streak yet @BiancaHabana for me it's anything over 50 bc that took almost two months and bruh the commitment level there @BiancaHabana dude I would be so mad if we lost our streak @BiancaHabana the last time we lost a streak, it was like 20+ days @BiancaHabana it was a 51 day streak too https://t.co/g5TKDEkMEf PoGo just got a lot easier because of an update, or because it's Halloween. Either way, I'm kind of confused Apparently I've seen a Gyarados but I didn't catch it? I don't remember seeing one at all? This was probably when I was in NY though Lost a streak with someone for the second time üò¢ When you get a spontaneous assignment to have a meal with someone you disagree strongly with but you don't have anyone like that right now @BiancaHabana it's like a fluffy white potato https://t.co/uiavkFPcIC @BiancaHabana awww he's such a cutie @BiancaHabana https://t.co/TusevqO719 My friend made me into a meme and it's great. I need to put this up on my wall I'm actually really sad that I haven't been reading since college started. I've literally read like 30 pages of a book for fun @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA I might just do it Lowkey want to download a dating app for the lols and not because I'm actually gonna use it seriously Props to Nikita for getting an actress that can actually speak Cantonese, and speak it well So far, the most amount of sleep I've gotten at college is 10.5 hours. The least is around 4ish hours Proud of myself for actually semi-understanding what happened at last night's soccer game You know you've become solid friends with someone when you start a TV show with them When fall break is almost over and so you realize that you should get started on homework but you don't want to Wow the lunch line is so long, I might actually skip lunch if this takes too long Why is literally everything due today and tomorrow? This is going to be a very long day I'm actually struggling so much rn because I can't seem to stay awake I just need several hours of uninterrupted sleep It was so sweet and unexpected and one of the nicest things someone has ever said to/about me The compliment I received earlier today truly made my day. Heck, it's gonna get me through the days until Fall Break There's a boy in my room and he's coloring from a Harry Potter coloring book with my roommate Just received one of the sweetest compliments ever that totally made my day üòä @BiancaHabana @TweetLikeAGirI hahahahah yes I saw this! It's so cute! Asked myself if I should be mildly productive or take a nap; the nap won I'm so done with the day. Honestly I'm just so done with it all Unashamedly stood outside an academic building I have no classes in for 7 minutes today because it was a Pokestop with a lure The plan was to take a 1.5 hour nap. I then woke up from a 4.5 hour nap. Good thing I was done with all my classes already I always tell myself I'm gonna do homework, then I end up doing other irrelevant things instead Yeah okay, it's official, I'm gonna use Scrivener for NaNoWriMo This might be my first year using Scrivener for NaNoWriMo. We'll see cause I'm not entirely sure yet @BiancaHabana hahaha yes i will Why do people feel the need to introduce physical contact to situations that don't require any? Because one day I might actually cry @BiancaHabana no problem! @BiancaHabana üëçüèª I'll try to get them online soon, or if I actually leave campus for once, I'll pick them up at the store @BiancaHabana how many do you want? @BiancaHabana I can get some and send it to you It's early October and it was 4 degrees when I left my dorm this morning. I don't think this is how fall is supposed to work Spent a good 3.5-4 hours at the library doing psych homework after dinner. On the bright side, I restocked my Pokeballs Finally sat down for my first proper meal of the day. See, college messes with every normal schedule you ever had I saved a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/bcev9d21YT NaNoWriMo Vlogs I liked a @YouTube video from @katytastic https://t.co/OCHcEbNIbc nanowrimo? Frick I yelped while watching Supernatural for the first time No idea what's been happening, but that's not cool. I can't be losing clothes like that. Those jeans won't even fit many people in my dorm And then I bought a pair of jeans last week, I'm absolutely sure of it, and now I can't find them. I'm 100% sure I brought them home too This is weird. I ordered socks from Forever 21 but they never came in the box with all the other clothes I ordered @whittynovels watching this for the first time and totally jealous of how easily and beautifully you sing harmonies https://t.co/pscOZqkUgr Okay, boys NEED to learn to have more respect because the behavior I witnessed and heard about tonight puts Christian boys in such bad light Survived my first official school dance in heels and all College life has become "I'm bringing my laptop everywhere so I can do homework in between pretty much everything" Sitting in a common area, waiting for the post office window to open. There's a Pokestop but I'm out of reach of it. Sighh @BiancaHabana i feel you *whimper* I have my #NaNoWriMo2016 novel up on my profile. Am I gonna be able to balance that + the first semester of college? Sigh. I'm watching the first episode of Supernatural. I'm gonna get sucked in and zero homework will be completed Oh wow, I was struggling so hard to stay awake during philosophy class Suddenly, I really want to take a nap Okay here's the thing about having one less laundry bag because someone took mine, needing to do two loads of laundry when you have one bag Today I learned that hot chocolate made with almond milk is really great and everyone should try it. Use dark chocolate mix for best results I had plans to get a burrito for lunch, but then I took a nap and now I'm gonna get pizza instead Today was actually a pretty good day Told myself that I deserved to take a break from classes and homework, so I'm doing my nails and watching Scandal Today, I remembered that the library is between two Pokestops. Guess who farms them in 5 min intervals while doing homework? @BiancaHabana OH MY GOSH THE CUTENESS https://t.co/UGYp9fzOvG @BiancaHabana YAY I'M SPECIAL!! üéâ @BiancaHabana am I one of your few non-NF friends?

Yeah, I'm always hungry at night. This is why I'm gonna gain weight during college Wow it took less time than I thought to do my psych homework. I planned to put like 2.5 hours into it and it took about 1 hour I smell blueberry muffins in the dorm hallway but I have no idea where it's coming from A perk of being petite is that even small sized hoodies are kind of big on me, so I always look cute even if I'm not trying bc I'm short Really craving fresh avocado bc it's been so long since I've had any. And it's not every day that I find guac in the cafeteria Review: The Assassin's Blade by Sarah J. Maas https://t.co/AqSO1kzsC3 Every hour from when I went to bed and when my alarm went off, I woke up.

Woke up thinking I overslept for a different class and someone stole my laundry bag @BiancaHabana be honest, is this what I look like? https://t.co/AHBu3qtXk4 The two classes I'm never on top of when it comes to homework: History and Philosophy Really want to take a nap, but homework Made popcorn so I can have something to do while watching The Matrix for class @BiancaHabana DUDE THIS IS SO CUTE https://t.co/mWqdK2DIyk @BiancaHabana AHAHAHAHAHA. I totally would've done that @BiancaHabana that moment when a dog is more likely to slow dance with you than a human boy is Went to bed at almost 3am and woke up at 8 for church. It's not surprising that I legit dozed off for about 10 mins during the sermon üòÖ It's under 10 degrees outside rn and I don't have all my winter stuff with me so hahaha I might freeze to death Tomorrow is gonna be the day I buckle down and get a ton of homework done Really want to watch Love Rosie again, but kinda also want to wait until I have the chance to force my BGF to watch it with me Skyped with the BGF today. Of the 3 hours, we spent an entire hour doing school stuff mostly in silence. And it was fine. It was great Really wish I could enjoy the weekend and not do homework, but I have so much homework Someone be proud of me for only taking one nap this past week, but also be sad for me because I only took one nap and I'm sleep deprived @BiancaHabana awww I love his spots https://t.co/JmdWLaxSUH @BiancaHabana who needs friends on campus I have puppy videos https://t.co/FzNIOzjwPZ @BiancaHabana Ayyy honorary Habana It's not personal or anything, I'd just prefer that you don't come in physical contact with any part of me Why do boys have to be touchy bc how do I tell you that I want to physically recoil from you when you tap my shoulder? @BiancaHabana IT'S A PUPRITTO https://t.co/hzphUSBFIE Just told myself that I'm not allowed to lie down on my bed because I might fall asleep and wake up tomorrow Got to cuddle and pet 2 dogs at the nurse's office today. Totally worth going back there for more doggie kisses and cuddles Highkey dying and pretending I'm only lowkey dying I have a really long day tomorrow and I'm probably gonna regret everything but oh well this is college life On page 115 of 240 of Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy: At this point, I feel like Be... https://t.co/W8pki1XAO8 @BiancaHabana I want a pet otter https://t.co/73JWcQ2zDr @BiancaHabana @girlposts THIS IS SO CUTE OMG Probs the earliest bedtime I've had in awhile @BiancaHabana okay so I know what I want at my wedding https://t.co/dtToW0jPZ7 On page 55 of 240 of Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy: So far, it's not bad https://t.co/IivsXbzd68 Kind of don't know how I feel about being done with 90% of my homework for the week.

Barely 6 hours of sleep? All the regret Okay but seriously, I need to learn to manage my time a lot better because I keep putting off homework @BiancaHabana SO MANY TINY PUPPERS https://t.co/6UKazoYw3F This is what I get for not doing any homework yesterday. Realizing I have a lot to get done as the week goes on I've needed way more naps to function during college than at any other time in my life. Someone please make nap-time a 3 hour class here @BiancaHabana hahaha I have yet to see a cute guy from my floor/hall @BiancaHabana nope this is just a guy in the same dorm. I don't think we share a hall And it doesn't help that I haven't seen that cute guy who said "How's it going?" since the day that happened, which was a week ago Today I was asked if I had my eye on any guys on campus. I mean, the cute ones are either taken, jerks, or already talking to other girls One of the reasons why I spend so much time in the library is because it's quiet and I can recharge a little in between classes The fact that I'm still functioning is a great success. I've come to realize that college is a struggle for introverts because people I may have forgotten to order a textbook? I'm not sure, I'll have to check when I get back to my room I really wish the library had blankets because I would take all of them @BiancaHabana meanwhile, I'm curled up in a study area in the library to avoid freezing to death @BiancaHabana JACKETS THAT LOOK LIKE FOOD @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA oh gosh if only that really existed @BiancaHabana i very well could be the human burrito of Messiah. And I have to buy winter clothes bc I basically don't own any Why is it always so freaking cold indoors? It's like they're trying to give me hypothermia. I might have to start carrying a blanket @BiancaHabana MY BABY https://t.co/5iY5IFtr6Y So far, the changes in iOS 10 have made me confused and panicked more than any other iOS update @BiancaHabana @damnitstrue tbh if they get together I'll be so happy I don't even care about my own love life Just took my first dance class in forever.

Which means I need to go halfway across campus to the store. Ugh @BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics THE NOSE. THE TINY NOSE. I CAN'T I've found a new method of note taking that basically gives me 2 sets of notes. Let's see how this works in the long run You know you're very Asian when someone asks what your weekend plans are and you say "Studying" because it's the first week of school I'm really excited for all the meals at the cafeteria tomorrow.

I've spent the last 2 hours looking at stationary on Walmart and Target, figuring out what I'm getting &amp; where The craving for avocado increases with each passing day without avocado This week alone, I've had my first Chipotle experience and my first Cheesecake factory experience I also caught my first Pikachu at the beach today, though I'm not sure what he was doing there üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä I just hit my toes on the side of the bed and faceplanted into the bed #adult Totally passed out in the car on the way home from the beach.

I'm not used to this much talking on a normal day And overheard my mom's friend talking about me having an arranged marriage for reasons unknown Been told that my future boyfriend needs to bring me to Venice because gondola rides are romantic, had my relationship status questioned So far today, I've been escorted to the dining table in a really formal fashion, arms links and all There are no Pokemon near me and I'm sad Okay, but the real couple goal in life should be to look as happy as puppies do when they see each other. That's love in the purest form @BiancaHabana dude I follow them on Instagram and they're great I'm literally sitting in one of the most perfect reading/writing spots ever https://t.co/hJM6KgiJUj One of the things I really have to do tomorrow is continue/finish reading the book I need to finish before school starts I'm so tired, and it's just barely 11pm. Probs gonna pass out in the next hour or so Stuck on the train. There's some kind of delay, but no one knows what it is. Yay! Not like we're already 1 hour late When you suddenly revisit an old friendship that didn't end well and both of you are unsure of how much good this does Why is it that I dreamt about cutting my hair last night? @BiancaHabana I love sleeping puppies My skin is like "Nope" about me being in the US. So far, I've broken out pretty badly I'm super tired and so ready for bed. I haven't even done anything interesting today @BiancaHabana OMG THIS LITTLE BABY https://t.co/7LCdslF0cm Casually listening to Taylor Swift while on the bus I just did that weird thing where I wasn't asleep, but I actually fell asleep for a couple of songs, then woke up again @BiancaHabana OMG HIS PAWS ARE TUCKED TOGETHER UNDER HIS CHIN Sitting in a Greyhound for the first time with my leftover Chipotle and Pikachu next to me I've been awake for 2 hours and already I'm so tired that I missed a whole word when texting my BGF, which made the text confusing @BiancaHabana idk this was accurate for me https://t.co/ztdTlEH7DO https://t.co/9VQ17xki4s Also, I'm still so behind on my Watch Later list. I have yet to watch videos that were uploaded in April/May HAHAHAHAHAHA Okay, gotta figure out how to balance my need to be alone with the necessity of socializing over the next two weeks HAHAHAHAHA I'm so bad with technology. My BGF and I don't know how to text each other now that I have a new Whatsapp number @BiancaHabana I never even finished my first glass of champagne When you walk so much in 4 hours that you hatch your 5km Pokemon egg that was at 3.7km previously The problem with being in a different time zone from my best friends is having to wait for them to wake up to respond to my texts/Snaps Has been a pretty good day in New York so far. I already caught 4 new Pokemon @BiancaHabana ahahaha I don't like champagne. Never tried beer, but Hayden said it was similar to that weird sparkling coffee @BiancaHabana wow dude your tolerance is significantly higher than mine @BiancaHabana what kind? So far, all I know is I don't like champagne, but I like cider @BiancaHabana omg what? You tried alcohol? @BiancaHabana interestingly, none of them were white. All the white guys weren't that cute @BiancaHabana it's okay, I think one of those guys might not have been straight AHAHAHAHAA When you wake up to 80 Whatsapp messages and 72 are from the guy you like üòè @BiancaHabana AHAHAHAHAHA but until he asks me out, I'm still single üòâ and I've already seen cute guys in New York üëåüèº @BiancaHabana bruh I AM single watchu talking about? I think it's cute when a guy admits to putting more effort into his appearance in order to impress you Tfw one of your best friends says your letter is perhaps the most special piece of writing he's ever received I've been separated from my best friends for 24 hours and it's already so difficult for me to accept that I have 9 more months to go @BiancaHabana AHAHAHAHAHA dude why are we even allowed on the Internet? @BiancaHabana yeah, dude, I don't know how other people separate from their friends so easily. How did last year's seniors do this? @BiancaHabana basically when we live together https://t.co/UKBQDsYd4A @BiancaHabana I miss you https://t.co/uvTcNNvmoi I'm gonna cry so much today, I might not have enough tears in me How the heck am I supposed to say goodbye to the people I've been closest to for the past 3-6 years? How is that even possible? @BiancaHabana this might make us both feel a little better https://t.co/MshPzQiKrp @BiancaHabana I totally know the feeling Heading to see some of my friends for the last time in a year. Not ready for this. I'm lowkey nervous and scared @BiancaHabana oh my gosh LOOK AT THIS PRECIOUS FLUFF üòçüòçüòçüòç https://t.co/8DGYgTd9bj I've written 4 goodbye letters and I have 3 more to write tomorrow. And I have to finish packing. I'm a responsible adult @BiancaHabana this would so be us with boys, except when they ask us out https://t.co/qbpoC5dbAl Okay, I've written 3 letters so far. I could probably squeeze in another one before I go to bed I've been writing goodbye letters for the past 4 hours. Someone help me before I get too emotional and down in a puddle of my own tears I was going to watch episode 4 of Stranger Things before bed, but I decided against it cause I'm lowkey scared HAHAHAHAHA Hello, backlog of videos I need to edit I finally exported the two videos I filmed on to my hard disk. I need to film at least 2 more before I leave Life goals in a picture https://t.co/JeIAGTtx42 @BiancaHabana mine was almost right, but my last 2 needed to be switched Cue me talking about romance for an hour Turns out that guys assume I don't like romance or romantic things because of my straightforward, blunt, practical personality @BiancaHabana ahahaha it got mine wrong I mean, I could push through it, but it would be around 5:00-5:30AM by the time I finish and I can't afford that. Not right now Sleep has won. I'm gonna wake up early to finish the last 139 pages instead.

All I know is that it's contemporary/romance I just bought the Hamilton because I don't have Spotify Premium and also I want to support the musical #Hamilversary @BiancaHabana ahahaha soz @BiancaHabana you https://t.co/3ZBuH3Zks5 Wow, I've walked so much in the past 2 days that my feet hurt. And yet, I didn't manage to hatch my 5km Pokemon eggs today It's one of the softest, most comfortable shirts I own. It's already one of my favorite shirts ever üòä My girls know me so well. They bought me a Hamilton shirt as a belated birthday present! @AmyCim wait, she's not British?!! Came home to 30+ snaps from my best friend Today has actually been one of my favorite days all summer Also, I bought two mugs at Disney because it's perfectly justified. I NEED a Baymax mug and a Zootopia mug Now, if only that Charmeleon didn't run away from me, that would've made the day better OKAY SO I GOT A SQUIRTLE TODAY AS I WAS LEAVING DISNEYLAND AND THAT MAKES THIS A GREAT BELATED BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM POKEMON I'm kind of sore from hiking yesterday. I wonder if going to Disneyland will make that better or worse ü§î I sometimes say really random stuff when I'm tired I'm so tired now. Gonna sleep early tonight cause I have another full day tomorrow BUT I did get to see 2 dogs and I got to pet one of them!! It was a decently successful day of hiking. We didn't end up swimming bc there were a lot of people and a couple eating each other's faces üò≥ Dude, I said "traveling," not "training" https://t.co/hRhNTwpcXT I've been traveling for a grand total of 16 minutes and already, the man standing next to me has really strong BO. Asian summers üòî Okay, time for bed. Really hoping I don't get lost tomorrow. Also, it'll be my first time in a bikini around a guy friend üëçüèª @BiancaHabana not quite as good as ours tbh https://t.co/gO6gOXUOlf Hiking with my other BGF tomorrow and I'm in charge of directions. HAHAHAHAHA we gon die I love that people are fangirling over Ning Zetao bc Chinese pride How does one plan a hangout with a person who only likes outdoorsy stuff/physical activity? The weather sucks so hiking is out Yes, it is beginning to hit that I'm moving away from home in about a week. I have yet to start packing, and I probably should @BiancaHabana "Char, you're only going out with me because my music teacher has dogs, right?"  "That needed to be clarified?" When you call your best friend "babe" in a conversation about puppies and hopping floofdogs and it's the most normal thing ever @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHA i'll just be like "HAYDEN I'M CRASHING YOUR MUSIC LESSONS NEXT YEAR FOR THE DOGS OKAY BYE" @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA it's a bunny pupper @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA there might also be a golden retriever at his music class but he's not sure it's a golden retriever @BiancaHabana babe, the spotted dogger is a bunny @BiancaHabana okay it turns out it was a dog at his music teacher's house so I guess I don't have to fight him anymore @BiancaHabana LOOK AT THE BABY FLUFFS!!!! https://t.co/kSKMgcgnBe @BiancaHabana if this isn't us, I don't know what is https://t.co/Tv1BdatsFv For some reason, my BGF had a dog in his house yesterday and neglected to inform me??! What kind of best friend is that? Rude üò† I've decided to spend most/all of tomorrow reading Heir of Fire On page 112 of 576 of Heir of Fire, by Sarah J. Maas: The plan is to do pretty much noth... https://t.co/7aNMiVZZP9 I should probably start packing. And reading the two massive books I need to finish before I leave @BiancaHabana as if we need more reason to love dogs https://t.co/f4ccA7xJPf The whole thing took a week's worth of afternoons and evenings The only plus side of me being sick is that I finally finished my first official coloring page My voice sounds weird My BGF just found out about my visit to the hospital in February that happened because I coughed too hard. And here I thought I had told him @BiancaHabana me too Took a look at my class schedule for the fall semester and once again, I find that I'm really happy with how I spaced everything out @BiancaHabana I don't know how I feel about this https://t.co/kYgwguhNb1 @BiancaHabana truth https://t.co/9VUVrf8DOW https://t.co/QE0oYX8XfF I've reached the part of being sick that involves dulled senses, headaches, and mild dizziness. Sigh üò∑ I officially have a combination of whatever my dad and my BGF had. Sore throat, coughing, and a runny nose üò∑ Just went through my phone and deleted about 200+ photos that I don't know why I still have @instagram Please just go back to how things were. It was so much better and easier @instagram I used Instagram so much more when it was chronological. Now, it's annoying to use and I hardly want to open it @instagram why add stories? We have @Snapchat for that already. Please just go back to showing our feed chronologically @BiancaHabana Gaze! It'll say that it's for long distance movies @BiancaHabana  https://t.co/7Ks9UbU8o4 Really hoping this sore throat doesn't end up with me coughing again. The last time that happened, I went to the hospital @BiancaHabana I found a website that allows two people to watch movies at the same time. We can do movie dates even when I'm gone üòä So, I have a sore throat. I'm pretty sure it's mostly from my dad, but it could also be because my BGF is sick and we sat together at church Sigh, and so it happens. My second goodbye before I leave Funny how some guys actually care so much about you and want to know more about you while others can't be bothered to get past the surface Learned that if I die and it's too inconvenient for him, my other BGF won't attend my funeral. I'd have to pay him to go. Great friendship Why is everything so cold indoors? Like, I'll go outside and start melting, but I'll get inside and get hypothermia. Someone fix this pls @BiancaHabana ultimate friendship, just like the old fashioned Filipinos üòâ https://t.co/CfQVfxKdI7 New shoes = blisters = me buying band-aids that are WAY TOO expensive Spent my entire afternoon coloring with my sister. I think I've come to greatly appreciate my coloring book and its ability to relax me I'd probably do this too tbh https://t.co/oXxTaTN8oX Hashtag relatable https://t.co/WLPjQAY2Mo Filmed two videos tonight. Hoping to film a couple more tomorrow and have them up soon Found out that my best friend's BGF has seen several of my videos HAHAHAHA it's weird but also kind of cool I think I found Toot Toot @BiancaHabana  https://t.co/0WCqaGszdc Planning to film once my nail polish dries enough for me to pull books off my shelf So I texted him a list of possibilities because I'm weird and we'll see if either of us can remember what we talked about Apparently my BGF and I had a conversation last night that we were supposed to continue today, only neither of us remembers what it was I just learned that mace is a spice. And that you can get high off nutmeg I just wrote a 3 page letter, filled with Hamilton references and feels. Now, I just have to write 9 more letters without Hamilton in them @CharmaineLimEn HAHAHAHA dw I'm excellent at controlling my feelings. Him, well....idk about him Making my BGF watch Love Rosie with me bc it's a legitimately good movie and one of the few romance movies I like Finished my second book of the month and now I don't know what to read Ended a 3 hour conversation about 20 minutes ago. It's almost 3AM but I don't regret anything I did a big adult thing on 4 hours of sleep today. Also, I have some coffee. And I was around people. I'm gonna need a nap later Is it possible to accidentally go on a date? What even is a date? Do accidental dates happen? Can there be almost-dates? Spent an hour hunting Pokemom with my BGF today. He caught way too many Zubats and Pidgeys Gotta stock up on some Pokeballs before I go hunting today. Dang, I'm too into this game for someone who hasn't seen the anime When you have to remind a friend of your capabilities with a knife because they think teasing you is a good idea @BiancaHabana OMG YES THAT LOOKS SO NICE Kinda want to visit the nearest PokeStop but it's almost 11 and it's sketchy to leave my house rn. Also, there are no Pokemon near me @BiancaHabana AHAHAHAHA i have two PokeStops outside my house so I just have to walk outside So far, I have a Charmander, and Eevee, and a Rattata. I shouldn't be playing this because I don't actually know any Pokemon names @BiancaHabana more reason for me to go to your house again üòú So, Pok√©mon Go is out in Hong Kong now. Does this mean I need to download it in order to see/talk to my guy friends? Super excited to watch Finding Dory tomorrow! You know it's gonna be good company when you're going with your best friend and your sister Conversations are really nice, honest, and interesting when two people are comfortable talking to each other about almost anything Straightened my hair for the first time in over 2 years. It's kind of weird but I also kind of like it Really tempted to fix my hair before going to college because I really don't like the shape of my haircut Might straighten my hair tomorrow for the first time in over 2 years. That's gonna be interesting Realizing more and more that I'll have to start saying my goodbyes soon, starting next week with my dad and the week after with my BGF @BiancaHabana LOOK AT HOW SMALL AND SHORT THEY ARE https://t.co/ITJdC8zDBG Had too much dinner, now I'm sleepy I think I'm gonna spend half of today coloring again I've picked out more stationary for college than I have anything else My foot fell asleep while I was coloring and now I can't move it Picked up my coloring book again, but the struggle is knowing what colors to use and where So far today, I slept in, watched Elementary, read, discussed life after marriage, and went to the doctor for a medical checkup. Not bad @BiancaHabana they literally have nothing in common, don't have a reason to like each other, and keep getting Scott in trouble @BiancaHabana oh hahaha I guess I was wrong in hoping/vaguely remembering that she died. Ahh, maybe this season @BiancaHabana WHAT THE F LIAM AND WHO? HAYDEN??? @BiancaHabana WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WASN'T THEM? WHO WAS IT? STALIA? PLEASE NO @BiancaHabana DUDE THE TRAILER OMG I SAW IT AND THAT SCENE THAT LOOKS LIKE STYDIA KISSING üòçüòçüòçüòç I think I need to hide in my room for a whole day with nothing but books and TV shows, just so I can recover a little #introvertlife Unintentionally fell asleep for half an hour after spending a day with people Trying to make plans with someone, asked when they're free, and my mind literally went blank after that. It's still mostly blank Nope. Totally didn't just procrastinate getting out of bed and getting ready for the day. Nope. What are you talking about? On page 154 of 450 of The Princess Bride, by William Goldman: This keeps getting better ... https://t.co/1jYxlu62oa Was called the least romantic person my BGF knows, so I patronizingly called him "Sweetie" on purpose Suddenly craving Kraft Mac n Cheese. More so because I know I can buy it tomorrow üòÑ @BiancaHabana summer goals https://t.co/kdICKPcKgx The Princess Bride is one of the most intriguing books I've read in a long time I really should be reading, but I'm finishing my episode of Elementary instead Been around too many people lately. But the thing is that I gotta see my friends more before we're all separated @BiancaHabana this is so cute!!! https://t.co/KG4zd5c5Np Can't imagine what I'll be like after reading this book https://t.co/JGUOzVdwvH Can't help it though, my brain is wired to pick up details and notice things quickly The downside is that sometimes that spoils mysteries for me because I'm too quick to notice inconsistencies in people One of my favorite things to do is actually to analyze people. It's fun and it comes naturally to me I think I like analyzing people's personality types too much. Criminal Minds and Sherlock have brought out this side of me Sleep depravity has resulted in a very confusing and amusing conversation The question is: To make more pasta or not? I'm feeling yes Guys, how does one say bye to 4 best friends for a whole year? Like, I'm not gonna see these people. How do I deal with that? Writing letters to people before I leave for college and I had no idea it would be this hard. Why is this so ridiculously hard? I did awkwardly bump into people I know today. It was strange. I think one of them pretended not to see me Hopefully I don't awkwardly bump into anyone I know today I watched the first episode of Elementary and I feel like I'm cheating on Sherlock with something that isn't on the same level I have to say bye to him in a little over two weeks and I'm NOT READY for that Thought I planned for everything with my departure for college, only to find out that I have to say bye to my BGF a whole week earlier Had an interesting conversation about what my life would be like if certain things didn't happen Puppy glo up https://t.co/DqUmkcBJmD I suck at being emotionally supportive over text. I never know what to do. At least in person, I can see their face and give them a hug @whittynovels It started 13 hours ago for me and I just decided to participate Okay, it's bedtime. This introvert needs to recharge after a day of being around people Kind of interesting to discuss appearances, insecurities, and self-love with my BGF @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHAH oh gosh what have we done I got to test out some Hamilton pick-up lines/relationship mottos today and it was one of the highlights of my day On page 56 of 450 of The Princess Bride, by William Goldman: I'm confused, but like a go... https://t.co/GONdve7FEz I accidentally got red lipstick on my BGF's shirt after hugging him. Now we're trying to come up with an excuse if anyone asks him @BiancaHabana HE'S SO CUTE!!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç https://t.co/M3uiluL5w5 @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHA he went to bed so not anymore @BiancaHabana especially with former best friends For the first time in ages, I caught myself smiling while texting a guy. I kind of like this? @BiancaHabana dw I'm equally unqualified @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHA another reason to have a dog Perhaps the best way to start my day https://t.co/WXiKVAZBvQ It's kind of weird when you and the person you like acknowledge mutual feelings but don't date. Conversations become very interesting I've come to realize that I'm even worse at taking selfies when I wear makeup cause my face looks different When one of your best friends lies to you so he can buy you this beautiful, illustrated, 25th‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mNYuWLZ8Vs @BiancaHabana I NEVER KNEW THEY ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE DOGS!!! BGF convinced me not to buy a book by saying I wouldn't like it. It was a cover so he could buy it in a beautiful edition for my birthday üòä When your extroverted friends are all having introverted days and you're like "Welcome to the Dark Side. Literally. We sit in the dark." I can't. I can't play Ingress. It's so boring. I just can't. I had to tell my guy friends. I just couldn't continue I started playing Ingress because my guy friends wanted me to. I'm not entertained in the slightest by anything so far I think I've just been persuaded to play a mobile game with a group of my guy friends. What have I gotten myself into? I really should stop procrastinating and go wash my hair @BiancaHabana LOOK AT THE TINY PUGGIES https://t.co/1JgyeNLD4j I just realized that 3 out of 4 of my best friends are definitely in different time zones when we all go off to collegeüò¢ Highly anticipating the Hamilton quote wars I can have with my BGF when he finishes listening to the whole musical It's so much easier to just read and write love stories than it is to try figuring out if you're part of one If you put your arm around me, there's a 99% chance I'm going to go completely stiff We'll see how long 4+ hours of sleep lasts me after I was awake for 20ish hours yesterday I'm awake and I can't fall back asleep. I've slept for about as long as I talked to one of my best friends last night I have to leave my house in 14 mins to pick people up and I lowkey don't want to Literally lying on my bed to regain some energy before people start coming When #WiserEP hits 22 on the Hong Kong iTunes charts @MadilynBailey https://t.co/qSqFPTegEz The first half of my birthday activities are over.

What do I do? Listen to Hamilton, of course Don't want to get up but I have to Basically told my BGF to ask me out. What is this subtlety you speak of? When you're having a sleepover and start discussing pre-marital sex and swear words in a very enthusiastic manner No one allow me back on social media until I learn how to spell and check for typos @BiancaHabana this tweet is literally just spiraling into chaos. I can't type. Or speak. Or be on social media. Someone stop me @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA that's because I made a type and I swear he's not gay @BiancaHabana YES I'm super excited!!! @BiancaHabana my hypothetical gay best friend fits into the category of "doesn't like me back," so it's entirely possible. If I had one But I really have to pay attention to the difference to prevent future typos Okay I only had to delete like 2 tweets so it's not that bad. One of them I kept because the context made it funny Time to delete all those tweets with typos Just realized I've been typing BGF as GBF for like two weeks now. Nope, that's wrong. He's not gay.

I haven't been this full since I was in the Philippines *slowly slipping into food coma* And there we have it, another short story that's less than a page long Just had an idea for a short story that involves a bicycle and two juvenile delinquents My birthday is in less than a week and not only did I forget, I also have no idea what I'm doing Last night, I dreamt that I saw Hamilton and met @Lin_Manuel . Unfortunately, none of that was real and now I'm sad My sister told me that my BGF can't date me unless he listens to Hamilton. I told him and he fell onto his bed in laughter Waiting for my BGF to download Skype because his FaceTime doesn't work. He won't let me call him on his phone üò© Best friends got into their respective universities! BGF replies with "Call me later :D" So, I'm guessing that's a good thing?

Time for me to find a puppy that I can cuddle and kiss all day! It's kind of really, really nice when your big brother texts you out of the blue to see how you're doing üòä @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA it's our coping mechanism. Mine usually includes sarcasm Ira is the most comically pathetic person I've seen in awhile on this show I found Hamilton pick up lines. Today has been a glorious day You know, if it didn't take my hair such a long time to dry, I wouldn't procrastinate every time I have to wash my hair @BiancaHabana I WILL CONTRIBUTE PURELY WITH THE FEW HAMILTON RAPS I KNOW Selena Gomez's hair is literally everything I want my hair to be. She is essentially goals Planning out meals is harder than I thought @BiancaHabana oh my gosh yes I will do this for my future children I liked a @YouTube video from @booktubeathon https://t.co/OMxGCx6yFU 2016: BookTube-A-Thon Reading Challenges! @gigglemiggles dayum girl! @gigglemiggles that's really amazing! I was supposed to go to bed 48 minutes ago but then I got distracted explaining introversion to an extrovert I'm ready for bed before midnight. This should be enough to tell you how much social interaction I had today and how tired it made me Today, I sat uncomfortably as a guy I just met last week scooted very close to me to look at a game I was playing on my phone When you have to teach someone how to hug properly... I keep regretting not sleeping earlier this past week, but I don't regret staying up to talk to my friend I just uploaded a new video to @YouTube: Quarterly Wrap Up | April-June | 2016 https://t.co/X6hV7QUKsS Guess who finally uploaded again after a month? https://t.co/kF7bytBK4X I never knew that someone could be inspired to come up with a pickup line because of Snapchat until last night. I had it used on me Guys, guess what? I FILMED TONIGHT! An actual video! I'm proud of me üòä Made my dad listen to Hamilton üòÑ DEFINITELY filming today. After lunch. Because I'm not doing anything else today @BiancaHabana if he and I date, I think the fact that I like him will be a recurring conversation that still goes "Wait what present tense?" The last 4 days of conversation with my BGF have consisted of "Wait what?" from him and "Oh gosh I thought this was clear" from me One guy inhaled as his response and the other replied with "Wait what? Present tense?" Never telling a guy I like him ever again because these last two times have been utter failures @BiancaHabana glo up goals? https://t.co/fNcO3xYzdf @BiancaHabana tell them I'll visit soon after you guys get back! @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHAHA dude I miss your family Best thing I've seen all day https://t.co/skrWE62uIP @NeagueE @MadilynBailey thank you I got so confused when Lestrade showed up in The Family with an American accent Unless I read and finish a book today, I'll be finishing this quarter having read 5,000+ pages @MadilynBailey just pre-ordered #Wiser and realized that it comes out on my birthday!! https://t.co/2ErbMiaaLh Review: Everything, Everything by Nicola Yoon https://t.co/xdFkzrkMZO 5 of 5 stars to Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins https://t.co/JFmOn92Vql Just remembered that I wanted to film tonight. Instead, I got caught up with my book. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing Are breakups as dramatic in real life as they are in fiction? The fact that I can relate to Lola and the Boy Next Door on a strange level is compelling me to finish it tonight Wrote my first short story that doesn't contain character names or descriptions There's something so nice about picking up a physical book after reading several ebooks üòä I think I might film tonight. Cross your fingers that it'll actually happen @BiancaHabana oh my. I never knew he was such an awkward dancer I think tomorrow might be a Disney movie marathon kind of day Which also means that I should finally film and upload something again. It's been about a month since anything has gone up on my channel I think I'm ending June having read 3 books, but that's okay because I read 7 books in May It's a strange thing to know that most people are more invested in my love life than I am. I just want ice cream üç¶ @BiancaHabana ty for being so chill Now I can finish binge watching Jane the Virgin without feeling guilty Finished my second novel today! It has a really crappy ending and needs a lot of work, but it's done!! Kinda want to read, but also kinda want to finish Jane the Virgin It would seem that things turned out differently from what I expected @ApriliusBrooks okay, I didn't cry, but I loved every bit of this book ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è FRICK I just realized I'm turning 19 in 2 weeks. I'm not prepared for this. Someone make it stop Basically forcing my best guy friend to listen to Hamilton so I can make references around him and have someone in my life who understands Had one of the nicest conversations in awhile today Can I have all of them? https://t.co/o3Ooeuajsi @ApriliusBrooks I'm reading Everything Everything and I'm not ready for this book to end. Why is it going by so quickly? It's so hot outside. I actually watched my ice cream sag and melt 10 seconds after I got it @BiancaHabana that could actually be the tagline!! @BiancaHabana I will happily endorse this book 100% until I die @BiancaHabana YES and in a way that is because it's legitimately true and not a cop-out from the characters @BiancaHabana YES OH MY GOSH YES LET THE PLATONIC FRIENDSHIPS RAIN/REIGN But then again, it means I can survive without them. This is why I'm good at recognizing people's outlines from a certain distance After getting glasses, I've started wondering how I survived the past few years without them @BiancaHabana YES PLEASE! End the book with "Dude, you're basically my sibling. You're part of the family." @BiancaHabana please do. There really aren't enough books about platonic friendships with zero romance involved @BiancaHabana dude what if you're the John Green of friendship quotes??? @BiancaHabana i feel like this tweet is the friend version of "You have a choice of who hurts you in this world" Pizza and ice cream, here I come üçïüç¶ Also, there needs to be more than one ice cream emoji Time to go to bed early because I'm starting to feel sick and I can't be sick tomorrow It's 9pm and I'm ready for bed. I know this because this is my second attempt at this tweet due to a typo in my previous attempt The nap definitely made things better. What could possibly go wrong when I fall asleep to Hamilton? Let's see if a nap makes things better or worse I'm way too sleep-deprived from being around people. And so much physical contact Yes please https://t.co/wjLmwYLzwr I need to stop having discussions with my guy friends about dating and romance @BiancaHabana NOO DON'T CRY LITTLE BABY LET ME LOVE YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @BiancaHabana truth https://t.co/7bj2OgwuIo @BiancaHabana OMG who needs human guys? Puppies are the way to my heart Why did I just have a conversation with a guy friend about dating by using only fishing metaphors? I just realized I haven't listened to Hamilton in about a week. What's wrong with me???? Clearly something is very wrong here Thank you to the guy friend who just reminded me of all the Doctor Who monsters I should be afraid of as an introvert going to bed Got my guy friend to watch Love Rosie, which is great because he loves unrealistic love stories It's 11pm and I'm exhausted. The only time I left the house was for dinner, so I have no idea why I'm so tired It's kind of hard when I have that one guy friend who can be really adorable and is really attractive but doesn't know it Why does Disney have a habit of making me so attracted to their animated animals?

I know exactly what I want I feel like I'm more confused now than I was before and I don't like it Last night, I was complimented quite sentimentally twice by the same guy. Both times were sudden and unrelated to our conversation @BiancaHabana hahaha it's pretty obvious He's also the only guy who ever texts me about romance related anime or shows. And the only guy who recommends me romance anime ü§î A guy friend started texting me randomly at midnight about k-dramas, which led to a discussion about romance and ended with sarcasm I've spent my whole day being WAYYY more invested in a fictional character's love life because mine is quite dull Just finished Lost Girls by @WriteAngie and I can't believe the rollercoaster of emotions she put me through. Can't wait to read Play Dead I feel like I should prep for an important conversation I'm having in 5 days but nah, I'm gonna read my book instead #priorities Okay so my plans for this week just went down to 2.

At least, I think I have 3 more things. It might just be 2. We'll see Dinner went a lot better than expected, but it was still pretty awkward. My favorite part was when me and the shy guy were early and waited Every summer in Hong Kong, I forget how hot and humid it can be. I get used to it by the end of summer, then forget about it by next summer Phone got fixed! Now I just have to get through tonight's dinner My phone screen will be fixed in about 1 and a half hours! This means I can stop having to press the top of the screen to look at pictures The number of people who support this ship just grew by another person. I think they'll need a bigger boat I'm just going to count down all the things I have going on this week and cross them out like a checklist as I complete them Really hope my phone can be fixed tomorrow It's always great to catch up with that one best friend whom you don't talk to often, but when you do, it's like no time has passed Dear No One by @ToriKelly describes me perfectly Time to start binge-watching Jane the Virgin again Sometimes I really wish I were more extroverted so I could have the energy to see/be around/deal with people I'm really not the subtle type. As confirmed by my BGF when he pointed out that I straight up told one of my best friends that I liked him Actually, a really big part of me wants to cancel all my plans this week except for one because that one is really important Part of me is legitimately thinking of not showing up, faking sickness, or just plain saying I don't want to go at all. But that's rude I really want to get out of a dinner thing, but I can't because it's an appreciation dinner.

Like please, can you stop draining my life force? I've been so tired all day for some unknown reason. I think I even managed to upset an extrovert by responding to "Hi" with "Mmm" @BiancaHabana AHAHAHA THE NUMBER OF PEOLE WE EITHER SCARED OR ANNOYED @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHA ALL THE TBT MUSIC Highlights of my day were buying avocados, petting cats, and realizing my new dress is perfect to make me look even taller in heels When your older brother/youth pastor calls dibs on preaching at your weddingüëåüèº Dominant emotion right now: Indifference I'm late to breakfast with my best friend, forgot a jacket for church, and probably going to die of hypothermia because of that She was such a wonderful person and such a beautiful light to all.

There's comfort in knowing she's in Heaven now (1/2) @BiancaHabana hahaha I think he'll be okay.

I'm good at flirting, please don't insult my skills with your weirdness @BiancaHabana like hissing over text.... @BiancaHabana you've got an interesting definition of "interesting" bc literally nothing is happening in my love life rn @BiancaHabana i swear if you just told him, your love life would be less boring. Besides, mine isn't all that interesting atm @BiancaHabana i thought you were living vicariously through me üò¢ I have no idea what's happening but I think the guy who likes me just hissed at me over text...what is he, a cat? When your best guy friend casually brings up our planned conversation about maybe being more than friends Someone explain to me what qualifies as a date, please. Because I have no idea and it seems my best friend doesn't know either @BiancaHabana i heard the analogy and I was like "wait, do I have an emotional peanut allergy?" When someone compares not knowing how to do relationships to having an emotional peanut allergy HAHAHAHAHA Dang, David Tennant as a villain is way more attractive than I ever thought it'd be After having coconut oil in my hair for 2 hours last night, my hair feels so incredibly soft and feels amazing When it's #NationalBestFriendsDay but you only have selfies with 4 out of 5 best friends so you can't make a cheesy collage @BiancaHabana !!!!!!! https://t.co/WzlnpWxOOC @BiancaHabana GET HER A MATE NAMED BROCK @BiancaHabana OMG YOU NEED TO SHOW THIS TO YOUR PARENTS AND HANNAH Why can't guys just be straightforward about their feelings without me having to prompt a conversation about/relating to feelings?

I ended up watching 10 episodes split between 4 TV shows. Yay Is it bad that I want to one day play a murderous psychopath? I feel like I'd be excellent at it and it's sort of a life goal Taking a break from reading to catch up on The Flash Currently breezing through a really good contemporay, but I also really want to watch Arrow, The Flash, and Criminal Minds Beyond Borders Like, tell me that I have to go see and interact with people and I can promise that I'll try to get out of it using the Internet or somethig I'm constantly amazed by what I can get done, all because I really don't want to go outside to see people.

Hoping to make it 6 before the end of the month, but knowing me, it's not likely Tbh can Sunday come sooner because then I can stop being nervous and also it means 3 days till I'm in the Philippines with my girls @BiancaHabana hahaha I'll probably keep my face pretty normal though, just so other people don't ask in case I'm not smiling @BiancaHabana regardless of what happens and when he gives me an answer, I PROMISE you'll be the first to know @BiancaHabana hahaha oh gosh. Ironically, this makes me feel less nervous @BiancaHabana at least it'll make for a good story (I think/hope) @BiancaHabana hahaha I hope it won't happen either because I think I might hurt myself more than I'll hurt him @BiancaHabana hahaha I'll be like "Hold on, I need Bianca for this" and get you before I punch him @BiancaHabana dw, you're gonna be the first to know what he said if he gives me an answer that day @BiancaHabana i guess I'm more used to it because I've been turned down 3 times? Idk, I'm just nervous to hear his response @BiancaHabana hahaha I think I'm actually more scared he'll feel the same way than to hear him say he doesn't like me Like I hope you feel the same way cause that would be great, but I also kinda don't because I don't know how to handle reciprocated feelings Even though this will be my 4th time doing it, telling a guy I like him is still one of the few things that make me incredibly nervous @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA that's me on a roller coaster @BiancaHabana looking at those posters freaked me out enough, idk how you actually watch the movie In 7 days, I'll be falling asleep in a room in the Philippines with some of my best friends @BiancaHabana because you can survive them and I can't https://t.co/o4XoktSUME When Taylor Swift is the only music you listen to for a few days bc boys and feelings Hotspotting myself so I can still tweet @BiancaHabana literally me on Sunday Half the power in the house is out, so that means no wifi and ALL the 3G right now So one of my best guys friends figured out who I like all because I texted him for advice.

I'm done. I'm good. Which also happens to be why I'm not often surprised by crime fiction, unless it's super well written and plot-twisty When I watch or read anything mystery related, my brain automatically notes all clues, suspects, and possible outcomes. I can't help it It's probably weird how much I love crime fiction and shows. It's just that some part of me NEEDS to solve some kind of mystery or crime Which is also evident in the number of crimes shows I watch. Like my long-standing obsession with Criminal Minds I LOVE mysteries and thrillers. It's just how my brain works. I love figuring out the evil plans, finding the killers, and solving the case Even though I don't think I have an absolute favorite genre to read, if I ever had to pick, I'd pick mysteries and thrillers I just uploaded a new video to @YouTube: T5W | Favorite Mothers &amp; Maternal Figures https://t.co/zOoyZaZwMw Yay moms! https://t.co/WPPrzwwEH7 I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/WPPrzwwEH7 T5W | Favorite Mothers &amp; Maternal Figures I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/9hUChQxm5W T5W | Favorite Mothers &amp; Maternal Figures @BiancaHabana tbt to when I sub-tweeted Matt constantly bc he was an idiot By the way, did I mention that I won #CampNaNoWriMo yesterday?

I just started listening to the Hamilton soundtrack. Goodbye normal life 3,264 more words before I hit my #CampNaNoWriMo goal!!! Currently, my book is at 163 pages, 27 chapters, and 90,570 words.

Thank you again for these beautiesüòò https://t.co/iphzTsVVM1 It took about 10 minutes before I realized it was a dream, and 10 more minutes before I confirmed that it was a dream The whole thing got to the point where I woke up and was irritated because I didn't want to go on this date, but really couldn't back out There was also a big disagreement involved and lots of reluctance on my part It was an insanely vivid and realistic dream of me trying to get out of a date with a guy I know in real life Remember how I said last night that I wanted to dream about a gorgeous guy? Didn't happen. BUT, I dreamt about trying to get out of a date But that's for tomorrow. Right now, I'm going to bed and hoping for a good dream with an attractive guy üò¥üò¥üò¥ I wrote today, but I'm confused as to where my brain is going. A new character suddenly appeared and I don't know who he is I've found that if I'm listening to a book podcast and the hosts start talking about a book I want to know little about, I'll fast forward Quarterly Wrap-Up | Jan-March 2016 https://t.co/zEJ1jVwQNU @BiancaHabana fave kind of nerd tbh https://t.co/qFEqkCX8hX @BiancaHabana HAHAHA I don't think that'll happen @BiancaHabana i swear it's because he likes to analyze the people &amp; their personalities for future interactions @BiancaHabana YES! It's a list of everyone's MBTI that he knows of. It's weird, but it exists @BiancaHabana hahaha ask Ethan for his list of people's MBTI results @BiancaHabana haha I think most people with the IS end up having F next @BiancaHabana HAHAHA you know what I realized? All my close girlfriends are Feeling and all of my close guy friends are Thinking @BiancaHabana remember when we said that I should re-take my Myers Briggs? Check out that introversion level!! https://t.co/c4QkjgybTk I liked a @YouTube video from @madilynbailey https://t.co/bhmdY2HOaE Dangerous Woman Ariana Grande // Madilyn Bailey Live Sessions @BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics HAHAHAHAHAHAHA @BiancaHabana @SincerelyTumblr HAHAHA I was just showing this to Phoebe!! Finally sat down to write and realized that I'm winging it to finish my book. I'm following about 1/3 of my original outline I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/CrejX0rUHv 7 Things No One Tells You About Long Distance Relationships Okay, I need to stop procrastinating and start catching up on my writing for Camp NaNoWriMo @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHA yes this is literally you @BiancaHabana @Iifepost i love this dog. I've saved his picture on my phone I think I give up on dreams with hot guys. I'm just gonna go back to my usual dreams and secretly keep hoping for another gorgeous dream guy On page 230 of 824 of Winter, by Marissa Meyer: I should be making more time to read this... https://t.co/Cjb97vFE6O @elisabethpaigex ohmygosh I know the feeling! I'm behind on my words, feeling slightly guilty, and not writing to fix that Here's to me wondering why Alec is the most beautiful person on Shadowhunters. Not complaining, but Jace, step up yo game #Shadowhunters Okay, I'm confused by Shadowhunters, so I think it's my cue to read City of Glass Is it a law or something that female Shadowhunters need to have insanely long hair? Doesn't it affect their ability to fight? Who tf is Lydia Branwell and what has she done with Inquisitor Herondale? #Shadowhunters @BiancaHabana LOOK AT THE PUGGY! https://t.co/WnPcgMebxc @BiancaHabana @SincerelyTumblr i love this puppy! I just uploaded a new video to @YouTube: Quarterly Wrap-Up | Jan-March 2016 https://t.co/EUZQFGZwsx Here's my wrap-up from Jan-March! https://t.co/3Vsaj8tHvl @BiancaHabana hahaha it's okay, mine is hilarious @BiancaHabana oh gosh Magnus Bane is basically my favorite thing about Shadowhunters @BiancaHabana this is fairly accurate for you, unlike mine @BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA I LOVE THIS. I feel like I should frame it or something! "Every man's perfect girl" HAHAHAHAHA Big question: Why do Clary and Izzy wear stilettos to fight, run, and all that? I'd be terrified of breaking my own legs Nevermind, I'm watching episode 3 of Shadowhunters because it's entertainingly bad @BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics HAHAHAHAHAHA I can't do this. Shadowhunters is the worst thing I've seen in a long time. I'm quitting the show Why are Jace and Clary casually holding hands while going to meet the Silent Brothers? #Shadowhunters @BiancaHabana I think we need this cat https://t.co/sGkUvmfLux The only up side is Valentine and Magnus Bane. Once again, I'm more interested in the villain and the guy with questionable intentions If I thought that City of Bones was bad, Shadowhunters is worse. The second episode is on the verge of disgustingly terrible Okay, if Operation Re-Enter Dream doesn't work tonight, we're moving on to Operation Have A New Dream With Hot Guy tomorrow night Yeah, this can be pretty accurate https://t.co/oqdiwgU6AH I have 4 videos filmed and ready to be edited, but I'm too tired to edit any of them rn. So, I'll have something up tomorrow instead I've decided to start taking naps at the MC on Sundays while the guys do...whatever it is they do. I might as well catch up on sleep @readbyzoe i try to envision what I want to write before I start, then I just let it all flow. My fingers take over @BiancaHabana hahaha maybe I should retake the test @BiancaHabana but you're both ENFP and I'm ISTJ This is yet another one of those times when I just need to hibernate with books &amp; Netflix because people are too stressful to deal with On another note, I've had 5 mentally/emotionally exhausting days in the past 3ish weeks and I feel like I'm about to have another one I keep failing at Operation Re-enter Dream. It's making me consider Operation Have A New Dream With Hot Guy @BiancaHabana wait, we're complete opposites? I thought you were the middle ground between me and Kasia üòï Can we please take a moment (actually, take several) to appreciate this?  Taken from @rainbowrowell https://t.co/ZFiTlEcKsz If you think that getting soap in your eye hurts, wait until you get facial exfoliator in your eye @BiancaHabana new favorite pickup line https://t.co/EppdwUCNwu Phoebe just made me spit soup from laughter I liked a @YouTube video from @iisuperwomanii https://t.co/IgYT02KMWQ How to Apologize (A Guide for People Who Suck At It) Starting my first writing session of #CampNaNoWriMo. Hopefully this goes well 'cause I'm already behind due to not writing yesterday Operation Re-Enter Dream failed again last night, but it's okay because I dreamt about the Tenth Doctor #Whovian Night 4 of Operation Re-enter Dream  Guys, this is getting serious. I've created a codename for my emotional obsession with this dream My introversion percentage ranges from 70% to ambivert depending on the day and my mood I don't understand how some people love cuddling and all that. Sometimes, just hearing about physical touch makes me highly uncomfortable üòï @BiancaHabana @SoDamnTrue Hahahahaha I can TOTALLY see this happening. Graduation pics with burrito @BiancaHabana his everything is so tiny and cute!!!! No one should be surprised that I almost always prefer dogs and fictional people to real, human beings. Not even remotely surprised @BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics poor baby! I just want to give him hugs and cuddles Neither of us realized how much we needed it until halfway through, and it was probably one of the best conversations I've had in awhile Spent 3 hours talking my one of my best friends over dinner and it was the highlight of my week. It was so great for both of us to just talk @BiancaHabana !!!! https://t.co/ISODAmNLWn So Operation Re-enter Dream failed again last night. Gonna try again tonight. I think I'm too emotionally invested in this dream @BiancaHabana NO AND I'M LEGIT SO UPSET. Why am I so emotionally invested in a dream? Let's hope that this works, because I'm still thinking of that dream and that guy *crosses fingers* Third time's the charm? This time, I have a different method. Think of what I was thinking of before falling asleep that night. With any luck, that'll work Trying this again. Attempting to re-enter my dream from Tuesday to see where that relationships ends up and to see that guy again #CampNaNoWriMo has started and I'm not writing. Well, I am, but I'm journaling, not writing my book. I'll do that in the morning @KristinaHorner thank you! Good luck on your novel too! The awkwardness radiating from Barry and Kara at the same time is pure gold @BiancaHabana we gotta break our record of 27 days @KristinaHorner @CampNaNoWriMo I'm doing it! Me: Dogs and books. Two of my favorite things Dad: Good, now we just have to pray that God will bring a man to you @veschwab most villains appeal to me more than heroes üòÑ @BiancaHabana i'm so proud of it üòÑ @BiancaHabana this dog is more talented than I am https://t.co/R3H5jaPX89 @BiancaHabana hahaha it's great, isn't it? I liked a @YouTube video from @brizzyvoices https://t.co/XtyKS4FVaX STRIPPED DOWN CHALLENGE I liked a @YouTube video from @jessethereader https://t.co/M5JxRIRMu1 BOOKTUBE STRUGGLES, BEAUTIFUL BOOKS, &amp; CURRENT READS | #CampNaNoWriMo starts in 9 hours. Am I entirely ready? No, but I have enough of an outline to finish my book with *crosses fingers*
