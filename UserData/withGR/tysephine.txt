I wanted to apologize to this lady when I didn't do anything wrong. I gave her a bill to read my new address off of bc I thought it'd help. Always say please and thank you and have a great day. Keep to my proper ma'ams and sirs. It knocks me for a loop when others don't. I have this thing where I just smile and be nice to everyone, all service workers. I feel we have a kinship. I always mind my manners... Until she asks you why you're standing there and then acts like you're ruining her day. Its very nerve wracking to wait in a place you're not supposed to and be stared at my the other staff. Just standing there. Waiting. The greeter sent me back to the same window because diff city = diff taxes, so that was less than ideal. What a mess. Had to go back in to get my tag renewal redone because they put half my address and half my dad's address on it. Wtf.

Nothing is more exhausting than mounds and mounds of paperwork. I did as much as I could be be ready for her SIX pets and yet it still took me almost 2 hrs to check them all in. I slept v well last night. This is the same client that I spent 4.5-5 hours working on getting all her records from all the vets she's seen since she left. It was fun.

Now even more people can make my hometown into a joke. Only the richest, most priveleged, most popular girls become Trail maids. I couldn't stand any of the girls from my high school who made it. But being an Azalea Trail maid was always a prestige position, a top tier club only a few girls could even touch. Each dress must have so many layers of crenolin, so many ruffles, so much lace, etc. Each is hand made, each is unique. It's nuts. As an adult, I think it's a ridiculous amount of money to shell out for a dress you wear for a year or two at most. As a child, I was fascinated with these "cupcake dress" girls. As a teenager I was mildly envious of them even though I never tried to be 1. @pronounced_ing All I know is that parents of high school girls shell out thousands of dollars to have these dresses hand made. WELCOME TO MY TOWN, WHERE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS DRESS IN MILES OF CRENOLIN AT SPECIAL OCCASIONS @TananariveDue They're Azalea Trail maids. Yes, we have weird traditions here.

Then mom is being wheeled out. Apparently they parked her in a hallway somewhere Pulled into outpatient surgery entrance, put on flashers, go inside to get mom. Reception calls for her and gets hanged up on by nurse. to call. At this moment the heavens open up and pour down over the city, knocking out traffic lights on my way back to get mom. The errand was a waste of time because they wouldn't even take my payment - which they could've told me if they'd answered in the 5x I tried The recovery nurse must've been hangry or something because she was less than pleasant on the phone. Told her I'd be there ASAP. Found the place but as I was going in I get a phone call telling me to pick mom. Google maps was so outdated it had a street that no longer exists, so it took me 30 min to find the place. Took mom to outpatient surgery this AM and was sent on an errand in the meantime to a place that was sketchy and had no sign.
