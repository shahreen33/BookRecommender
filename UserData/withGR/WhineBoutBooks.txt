Winner chosen 3/20 noon E‚Ä¶ @rileymarie1196 i just ranted on that earlier, Its too much racist bs @rileymarie1196 Talking bout Black Witch? The MC refuses to commit a massive genocide and ends up uniting all the races together. On some White Savior bullshit! If this book actually gets a sequel, I'm guessing that it turns out the MC is the Black Witch or gets kidnapped to enhance their powers. In conclusion, The Black Witch is beyond trash and doesn't even deserve to be read let alone bought. Why is every character racist or prejudice or even think that they're‚Äã a superior race? The MC tells her brother to hide his gayness, has a Steve Bannon like boyfriend who assaults her. Then is still racist in the end. It's literally a shitstew of racism, microaggressions, sexist and homophobic views. I'm talking bout The Black Witch. What's the point of this book? Meant MC not Mac. Why tf would you write a MAC that's racists and then not have them learn anything from other characters of different races? Why the hell everytime I find a book I want to read, it ends up being a shit-show of racism? Call me petty but I'm calling out everyone and everything that is problematic (trash)! I don't tolerate them or anyone with those same views. I will shut your shit down bc you don't deserve a place to act like that.

I may be a little pessimistic but I know that there won't be a show like #PleaseLikeMe especially one that will air in America any time soon #PleaseLikeMe was about an adult male going through troubled relationships and a chaotic family. That is why I could relate so much to it Even though the first episode was about the MCs sexuality, it flowed and evolved sooooo naturally throughout the series #PleaseLikeMe Representation matters alot now and there's also the fact that there probably won't be another show like #PleaseLikeMe for awhile The show was so funny and awkward, that's what made it real. So thank you @JoshThomas87 for making an amazing show #PleaseLikeMe I'm not just sad because it was a really good show but it was the best gay show that was written and created by a gay man and relatable. Just found out that the 4th season of Please Like Me is also the last üò≠üò≠üò≠ Got like 4 shows to catch up on The 100, Salem, Please Like Me, and Riverdale.

Nope! After he continued to send me dick &amp; ass pics, when I clearly didnt want nor ask for them. I did some digging on him thru facebook Stereotypical accusations about me and my genitals. No sir! Told him that I had someone I was interested in already, but did that stop him? After a few days he gets all flirty. But then it gets nasty and highly inappropiate on his end. With all of his personal questions So me and this person start talking about the old days and that LGBTcom account, but I didnt recognize him. Now I wasnt the person that was being harassed when we first blocked him. And I totally forgot about them even when they DMd me 2 days ago All of this happened in 2014 and I had a second twitter account that I used and then deleted. But guess who came back and found me here? Someone in our group of DMs didnt get the hint or didnt care and continued on with their bs. They were blocked and kicked out by everyone! Flirting but when someone says that they are taken multiple times and you dont get the hint. You will back the fuck off or be forced to!!! So after alot of us got really distasteful DMs, we left again and only talked to each other in DMs. Now I have no problem with harmless id even know why or how it got like this, but pretty soon everyone was into except me and a few of the people that left before. After a few months of feeling welcomed in the LGBTcom. The account turned into a hookup thing and it got nasty real quick! I was skeptical at first but I saw some evidence that showed them improving. So I came back and watched and participated again. Had changed and only one of the old admins was there. But they brought in 2 others to help rebuild the community. And to be better. There were many people who left before and after me so I didn't start it. After a few months my "friends" DMd me saying that the account had After numerous attempts to stop the hatred, with help from many ppl I've got close with. They still didn't care, so I placed tf outta there Not only is that extremely problematic and disgusting be but 1 of the "admins" agreed with it and the others didn't do anything to stop it. This community had alot of not a letter exclusion. Which was basically if your sexuality doesn't match the letters LGBT, you didn't exist This account has been deleted and has been long gone, but some of its followers kept in touch with each other. But not me! Now this LGBTcom had its own Twitter account that 3 people ran &amp; it quickly gained a following of sorts. I also partake in the book community but I hesitate to fully participate &amp; make friends bc of what happened in the LGBT community I have met so many cool, interesting and really awesome people. The communities I was in, was for anime, horror movies, &amp; LGBT discussions. Sooooo over the past few years on Twitter I have been actively apart of numerous communities and participated in many discussions OK here comes the rant or story time, whatever you wanna call it.

Hell I know certain guys on Twitter that are even better than the guys here tbh I rather just talk to them than to ever deal with the messy cesspool of the dating scene here. Thank the gay gods that this app lets me talk to guys in other states and countries. The dating scene in my town is everyone is either to young, still confused/just curious, taken, or stuck up. Like you want a daddy or something. Tf outta here with that bull! Like go live your life and be a teenager and do high school shit wit yo friends. Don't be lookin at grown men. Not only am I waaaaaaaaaay to old for him. He's already lieing bout little things, trying to be grown n shit. I was having any of it. I report his profile for being under age since that's what you can do on this app. I got up and walked outside Really, really. This child is on a dating app for grown ass people. And he goes to my old alma mater what? I go back to his dating profile and read the whole thing and he writes he's actually 16 not 19 like it shows. Wtf?!? He was wearing a band shirt from my old high school. It said UIL something something 2016. Deadass! He smiled at me and I smile back but then I look at his shirt &amp; I feel my whole face fxckin drop instantly We were locked in the dreaded Gay Gaze (I ain't even gay tho, but whatevs). That's the most irritating and awkward situation ever He was kinda cute at first but when I looked up from my screen, deadass he was staring hard af! Homeboy was right there. I didn't check his profile tho. Instead I checked to see if he looked on mine . . . .and he did! Idk y I call it a dating app cause it's failed its purpose tremendously. But as soon as I open it up, guess who's 20 feet away from me So I started to look busy on my phone. Some Pok√©mon Go, some booktube and storytimes. But something told me to check out my dating app We were in the waiting room and I had to avoid eye contact cause it was just so uncomfortable.

Trust and believe Trump has no love for our community. Trump for president? Be ready for marriage equality to be a thing of the past and for discrimination to be legal based on religious grounds. our history of dealing with politicians like him for decades. It's not as simple as dismissing gay Trump supporters as agree to disagree. Member of out community who votes Trump doesn't know I have come to this conclusion about those of us that wish to vote for this vile orange asshole After talking to 2 friends about why they believe Trump and his party are going to be good for the country &amp; their civil rights.
