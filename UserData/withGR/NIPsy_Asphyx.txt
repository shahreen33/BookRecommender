So excited about life today. Guess I'm ecstatic to have accepted my position and be working on a plan. No achievement is beyond my reach. Have a great day, homies! "At my oology (should be eulogy) I want to be remembered as a educated man of character." Not gonna happen. You're obviously not educated. I think I'm just gonna stop giving out my number. You're gonna have to stalk me to find contact info. Can't  believe that holy high roller. Anyone who always smiles and never has different expression is obviously suspect. Should've known better. He's cut before he started. #whack Jr is out for the count. She's gonna be mad as a mug when she's gotta wake up to walk outta here. Hee hee hee. #evilmomlaugh @wojemoma Me too. So good to see you and celebrate with you. Bunches of love. With my daughter at her first UK Women's basketball game. She's having a blast and it just started. Next time we'll dress for the occassion. My daughter is walking around practicing karate in 5 1/2 inch black patent leather pumps. It's pretty impressive. 5 of 5 stars to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S.

BUUUUUUUT she is small enough to carry a princess backpack. Hmmmm. Ijs. It is not christ-like to wanna choke your mom while in church during a basketball game. I'm working on it! 5-year old basketball commences now. Yea! @WhosthatCurl When did I shut down your sisterly love? Lmao. You always crack me up. @WhosthatCurl I was messaging someone, spoiled ass. In February's issue of #Parent&Child, #DrewBrees is on page 31 with a meat impression. Not impressed, but it's there. Hilarious. @CroleyMcCoolKid Totally wrong. Take your heart out, stomp on it, walk away from the bloody remains without turning back. @T_to_theErrence OMG! You tweeted. Oh happy day! I am at working wondering why @CroleyMcCoolKid has not been keeping me awake. I am severely disappointed. I am super excited about the seat that I hope to occupy later. Big things!!! (heeheeheeheehee) RT @blulynx3: Let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man. @Jherron1976 Hey! That's just how we do. I'm not even from here but 6 years later I figure I'll claim it. Still an EKU fan though. #UKsucks @Jherron1976 There is culture. We kill people for sport. We decorate civics with dragons and flames. Women wear high tops to balls. #elite @Jherron1976 Lexington is slightly awesome (for the first 36 hours, lol). I like it here though I do ache to travel. Where are you working? @Buc_you_too Women cut their hair, grow it back, n rock it the same way it was before&lt;----We are complex/not meant to always be understood RT @Buc_you_too: I keep alot shit to my self in a effort to not come off like a smart ass to dumb people.. @Buc_you_too Nice philosophy. I think it's one of those that needs to be practiced more and not just idealized. @Buc_you_too That's pretty prolific. Cleaned the toilet and sink. Don't want to do anymore. I'm tired and still have a huge list to go before the night is done. #whiny #suckitup Cleaned the toilet and sink. Don't want to do anymore. I'm tired and still have a huge list to go before the night is done. #whiny #suck ... Kitchen and downstairs bathroom cleaned. Upstairs bathroom about to commence. On it. Need some milk for chai. Sad :( #kenyaninfluence Did Shane just hit Pilar in the head with a croquet mallet?! Wtf, son?! This is bull! #Weeds season 5 Jr asleep. Time to clean and prepare for tomorrow. #supermommode Getting things done with Delores #DeadLikeMe Dinner done. Jr showered, in the bed, and ready to be out. Bedtime story read. Behind schedule but a good night. (Karate was great btw!) I just made a cheddar and pepperjack grilled cheese sandwich so delicious I smacked myself! G'night Washed and twisted my hair yesterday. Can't even tell now. #themsthebreaks Laundry done. About to clean off a couch and then we're done for the night. #Weeds has gone downhill steadily since season 3. Ugh! Bathroom cleaned. Tea made. Continuing to fold/hang laundry. NP #Weeds season 5 disc 2. Not better yet. More buffoonishness. @WhosthatCurl Lol. Broaden your culinary horizens. Eat outside the box. Other than #Wal-Mart and #Kroger what are reasonably priced places to buy essentials? No, Chefs, not your essentials. Non-chef essentials. @WhosthatCurl Grilled cheese and tomato soup is awesome! Plus, your mini bestie loves it. Hee hee hee! Ten years, two kisses, simmering love, near misses, minute abundance,  intimidating power, too much to tell, where's our....beginning? Military brats: Do you feel that your house is never clean enough? Do you store whole onions in the fridge or pantry? Jr's in the bed. Dishes are washed. All laundry washed, hanging/folding now. #ChrisBrown playing. Good times. What goes with grilled cheese and tomato soup? Cut my finger open while cutting potatoes. Tragic. Keep it going. Mashed potatoes on deck. Too much rest for the maternal. My face still hurts and I'm exhausted but it's Jr time. #suckitupanddosomepushups My face hurts like a mofo. Will be curled up in the bed until time to retrieve the young one from school. G'day. #postrootcanal Is there a #Tudor-esque story of George Washington, Abe Lincoln, Ulysses Grant? #Hollywood has made the blanks in history semi-extravagant. Change of plan. #Tudors season 1 episode 6 is up. #unenthusiastic #WhyDidIGetMarriedToo was a letdown. Disappointed. Did like #JanetJackson's closing song. #Weeds season 5 up next. Twisting my #locs finally What do you eat with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? It doesn't do you any good to get mad about things that you can't change. However, it motivates you to make all things change-able. #annoyed It doesn't do you any good to get mad about things that you can't change.

Back to the liquid diet for 24 hours. #whiningcommencesnow My ear and hairline are numb I am beyond medicated and not liking this feeling. Waiting for the meds to kick in at the dentist. Cleaning & crown. Let's see how long I can't eat after this. Pregnant by the mayor of Tijuana! This show is going straight to hell and I can't stop watching. #Weeds ~Ladylike~ I just ate some generic cinnamon toast crunch and it tasted like raw ass gone to die on a bed of whole grain oats. Weirdly delicious. Lol. My stomach is chewing a hole through my kidney and spleen. Gonna have to rectify this situation. Gluttony before my dentist appt. #smartplan Watched #weeds season 4 disc 2 and am disappointed conrad and halia have not reappeared yet. This is some bull. About to read #deadreckoning I think when we get home it's going to be an early night for me. I'm about to be worn out from kindergarten homework. #sleepymom ~Ladylike~ Super excited about my new dress. Black, short, clingy. Can't wait to rock it! Yea!!! #PeepSwag @CroleyMcCoolKid #peeplife? That's the funniest thing ever. I'm rolling still. @Jherron1976 How is it that you live in Lexington and I have not seen you yet?! I am flabbergasted and appalled. Why is #MajorPayne trending?! I love to chew ice but because of dental work cannot. #3 0thingsaboutme To have loved and lost hurts @Jherron1976 I'm sure you're doing great, Twin Frat. Congrats on six months!!! Why am I awake? I am going back to sleep. 50 more minutes Chicken chili with my Junebug and then bedtime. Got a lot done thanks to @WhosthatCurl babysitting. Just to clean up after dinner. #Imsleepy Chavea @TrueBeauty_21, thanks for watching my Jr. You're kindness is as always much appreciated. Thanks Shameka @WhosthatCurl for watching Jr for me. You're awesome and I totally appreciate you cultivating her special blend of awesome. Bested by #TheWomanInWhite but I will attack it again at some point. #TheFrenchLieutenantsWoman is up. I will read diligently. #bibliophile @WhosthatCurl Sure. I'll explain. Tell her to ask me when she gets home. @WhosthatCurl Still tell her to behave. She knows better than to act like that. @WhosthatCurl Tell her to hush or no library. Good behavior is all that is rewarded. @WhosthatCurl Congrats on the respite. Lol. Enjoy the break. Hee hee hee. Friends who are loyal to a fault are priceless to me. We may not talk for months but when I need you you coming running. #gangstafriendish Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic Capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it.Dumbledore A good laugh makes the day so much better. Thanks, Shameka. You're effing hilaious and now I can continue on my day. @WhosthatCurl got me laughing uproariously with these texts about Jr in church. "mid dougie" and "...my minion, not against me". ~Ladylike~ @WhosthatCurl Mean ass! Be nice to the babies. @WhosthatCurl You're good with kids. They love you, you're kindred spirits. . Quit trying to play hard and take that baby to the bathroom. Lays it down and can cook. Damn powerful. No wonder girls lose their minds/abilities to reason. #hisishkray  Clean/shop/write. #adrenaline @BluTenacity Me too! But not everyday for two weeks. My auntie would say, "That chile got a tapeworm. Lil castor oil get right tight." @BluTenacity Pregnant tendencies! @BluTenacity What you getting a dress for? DEB, in the mall, has some really cute ones right now. #fyi ~Ladylike~ "Back in the day you woulda got it." Back in the day I mighta gave it to you, but today I realize you're raggedy, you don't stand a chance. Why am I awake? Guess it's time to make moves for the day....In about 20 minutes. Maybe. I am sleeeeeeeeeeeepy @WhosthatCurl Lying isn't in itself illegal so I'mma let that go. No freaking blacks though! Y'all have a good time. Thanks, again! Jr scored! 1/4. Guess Pops yelling, "Take it to the hole, baby. Stop for no one." was a motivating factor. #funnyasheck 5-year old basketball about to commence. Nitro has been taken. I should be ok this week, I hope. The excitement is just too much. Not the night I had planned or imagined, but spent time with my bestie so I won't complain. However, I'm a-waiting and a-waiting. #goldfinger #jamesbond #007 @WhosthatCurl You geeked up? Seeing spaceships and bankhead? Lol. You crack me up. @WhosthatCurl Just hung up on me. Mean neo! Dollar Tree has a frozen food section and takes EBT. I'm about to start stalking D'Rondre (employee at pimlico location). #iminlove @WhosthatCurl Are you ok? Just read that you weren't feeling ok?

Embrace it! ~Ladylike~ @CroleyMcCoolKid Oooooh. What'd you do?! Was it embarassing? ~Ladylike~ @CroleyMcCoolKid You are so silly. I'll be awaiting updates about this new girl. Be nice and your wonderful self if you like her. @CroleyMcCoolKid Go for it! Nothing pervy like your previous craziness. L. @CroleyMcCoolKid What are you talking about, youngin'? Who is she? Is she hot? Prayers going out for the men shot today in front of my house. Senseless violence. #wegottodobetter @CroleyMcCoolKid Wonder who left the traces of semen on her breath. Hmmmmm... @CroleyMcCoolKid You're mean. Don't leave that poor girl wanting you. Keep yourself outta mouths. L. Eventually I will not love you and that's gonna hurt so much better. Self-evaluation: #punkasschump Of course as soon as I resign myself to going to bed I get a burst of energy. Doing dishes, got clothes in the washer, up next the bathroom. @CroleyMcCoolKid L?! Love it. You're hilariously retarded. Def not gonna make it til midnight tonight. Somebody text me @ 6 to make sure me and Jr are up for the day. #thanksinadvance #goodnight @CroleyMcCoolKid Don't be looking longingly at my fantastic fluffiness likcing yo lips. Fun-sized=where it's at. I like the victory screech. @CroleyMcCoolKid&lt;------------pervy young ass lil kid (w/ abs) who does laugh out loud and thinks he's gangsta but really is a marshmallow Wanted to twist my hair but not in the mood. Think I'm gonna attempt to eat and then read myself to sleep. #saysomething About to put the sleeping Junebug to bed and then curling up on the couch to twist another third of my hair. Yea! Awwwwwwww shit son! @BluTenacity bout to snap off. @WhosthatCurl I'm just saying. That's how we do. Allizee? We gotsta do better. Allizee Nails? Really? Like for real though? Huh.... @WhosthatCurl Sorry. Did I ruin your nincompoopery and shenanigans? I am ever so sorry, but the list stands. I'll be sure to pack crayons! @WhosthatCurl No virgin drinks or candy cigarettes, no pretend arson, no practice terrorism, no role playing grand theft, no premeditation. @WhosthatCurl Other than Steve Jobs that list was unimpressive. You've decimated your point. @WhosthatCurl Give Jr margaritas and I'm cutting everybody then sendin @Buc_you_too to take care of the pieces. Jr said control the mean dog @WhosthatCurly She totally has a season of iCarly on dvd. I'll take it back to the library. Mike is trying to hype her up for Saturday. @WhosthatCurl Got my baby going to University of Phoenix cause BCTC won't take her for a 13-year-old larceny charge. #negativeghostwriter @WhosthatCurl I'm cool til we start freaking blacks. All illegal antics must be pre-approved and juvenile expunge-able. #collegeandcareer Crash on Man-o-War @ Buckhorn. Traffic crawling, left lane only is moving. Drive safely, fam! @CroleyMcCoolKid Ain't nobody worried about your lil 6 pack. @BluTenacity That's pretty gross. Crispy eyes? Ugh! 1/3 through twisting my hair and I'm finally sleepy. Of course I started at the back of my head. Blah! Continue this tomorrow. #goodnight Twisting my hair and miserable. #whiny Watching #Killers and then going to bed. Would turn in now but I don't want to wake up before the alarm. Cranky cause I'm hungry. #childish This is when I need someone to stroke my hair and rub my back. Not feeling my supermommiest but have taken care of my biz. #chillmode Excited for my pervy lil bro @CroleyMcCoolKid for his promotion at work. Very proud. You're setting a great example for your son and dads. I need a starbucks white hot chocolate, a steak n shake cookies n cream shake, a slimfast chocolate royale, and  lipton's citrus green tea. If I am not able to eat tomorrow and my face still hurts it will not be a good day. #justputtingitoutthere My face really hurts. @CroleyMcCoolKid Way to go. Are you doing the 230-11 shift? Very proud of you. @CroleyMcCoolKid Congrats, young homie! Dispatch? Why does the dentist always ask questions when they've got your mouth propped open? Wrong on two levels. #juststop @CroleyMcCoolKid Lol. Maybe they're gay cause guys come at them like that. You're goofy.

No sleepy as you aid the ungrateful on their way to work. *smiles* @wojemoma I think Brownlee & @GIMAQT_1920 would be quite proud of us now. #stilletos #makeup #dresses We're #MuLambda all grown up. Lol. @GIMAQT_1920 Luckily I had @wojemoma to use a similar calibre of dress. Lol. We could party it up Mu Lambda style now though. #stillettos @wojemoma Thanks, homie! @wojemoma Girrrrrrrrrl, jeans, t-shirt, n boots.

I need details, photos, etc. @CroleyMcCoolKid I didn't get my mean text today. Or am I not a nice person? Crab lasagna n garlic bread in the oven. Jr in the shower, hair washed and about to be twisted. Gonna miss bedtime but hair will be done. #commando @WhosthatCurl Happy Founders' Day, Neo #6! What a great lady you're turning out to be. Very proud to call you my soror. 20 minutes #now Happy Founders' Day to all my Dovely Sorors of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated, especially the Mighty Mu Lambda Chapter! ZZZZZZZZZ-phi! Washed dishes. Folded laundry. Cleaned Jr's room. Talked to my girls about Vegas. Watched #Weedss3d2. Danced like a crazy person. Stenciling I want to get a tattoo on my right breast. Shoulder to ribcage. Thoughts? @wojemoma I know! She has perfect grades and is fantastic at school, but doesn't like books. I'm gonna have to check her college homework! Called Jr and asked if she minded me getting rid of some of her toys. She said no. Asked which could go, she said "any of the books." Separated Jr's toys and got the room straightened. Major feat. Now to figure out which piles she doesn't get to keep. She's gonna flip! What's a #lizardlick? It's like saying "There's something about him...I can't put my finger on it." american's just use it wrong. Ethnocentricism gone wrong. @mikehibbler It means "I don't know what". Hey! Be on the alert for smart cycle cords. Jr has lost hers and I want to find some before her birthday in May. Thanks, homies! @BluTenacity 3 minutes, Soror! You're practically done! Started cleaning Jr's room and instantlly got drowsy. Nap time! @CroleyMccoolKid I'm off til Wednesday. Glad you enjoyed it. Hope you behaved. *hugs* @CroleyMcCoolKid Missed you at work today. Not as hilarious without you and your rock bottom tweets. Hope you enjoyed your day off. My daughter's room looks like the ghost of christmas past exploded with violent pink diarrhea. It's illegal for a room look like this. It is @CroleyMcCoolKid Where you at, young skinty homie? @BluTenacity Damn, you must actually look mean as hell. You always look happy at work. Lol. Maybe tired from kicking it, but not mean. @WhosthatCurl I shouldn't celebrate that I fed Jr and took her to get immunizations? What if it's my first time not being a crap parent? I took my trash out. Me. I did. By myself. No Jr accompaniment, no man, no threatened neighbor kids. SHALANA! FYI: last time this winter. Just realized my pap is due at the same time as I begin my birthday celebration. What the crap kinda gift is that for yourself? A speculum? Overshare: Just realized my pap is due at the same time as I begin my birthday celebration. What the crap kinda gift is that for yoursel ... @WhosthatCurl Who'd rather hang out with lame alphas than those damn zetas?! Sacrilege! Say it ain't so. Lol. You're a hoot. @WhosthatCurl Quit partying all night Saturday and doing tap dances off only childishness then you could stay awake for 14 hours of chur ... I might've shoulda gotten my trash taken out before the pulloff. Guess I'm taking it out before I take off my jacket. Ahhhhh! @WhosthatCurl Wake it up, Neo! Pull your religious life together and actively listen to the word. @BluTenacity Lol. You'll be off soon. You only have 1 hour and 50 minutes. Yea! Lol. @BluTenacity So excited for your new car....and that I got off before you. Ha ha ha! Yea! 53 minutes and counting! I need to get out of here. Why are we so busy!

That gets you into trouble. Take yo' ass to sleep. Sleep is good for you. Hell, go to work til 1 a.m. Second time today you've made my jaw drop. You need a hug, fa real. I'll keep that in mind though. Now I'mma be always laughing at work. Credit where credit's due. You age 10 years and get your grown man weight up, at least 225, and I might be in competition with Angie. "I'mma send you this picture of me so you can get wet at work." I'm still laughing. Hilarious. Pic was hot though. #abtweet Upward Parents, how do I iron on these stars? I am lost....for real. What's the best dishwasing liquid? Grease fighting and soft on the hands. Kissing and hugging and touching and loving and nothing is better than tonight together Just painted my toes mauve. Yeah, mauve. Brownies and Tea! #weeds season 3. This would be great if my toes weren't freezing. Ugh! Just looked at myself in a full length mirror for the first time in over a year. Conclusion: y'all gotta start paying to see this. Love me! 45 minutes in this tritch! @WhosthatCurl I want a burrito before @True_Beauty21 starts peeing in the beans! @WhosthatCurl That kid has cheeks like Jr. Looks like she is storing snacks for winter. Adorable!!! 5-year-old basketball begins in t-minus 1 hour 10 minutes. I might be too excited for this. Already experiencing heart palpitations. Jr was at the tattoo place ready to hop in the seat. Her butterfly is adorable. Might have to get it so we can match. 25 minutes and counting! @BluTenacity, booooo-yahhhhhhh! @wojemomma 11 years old and super grown. @WhosthatCurl Maybe, I doubt it. @WhosthatCurl Maybe she's at work Me: We're on a one hour delay. Her: What's that mean? Me: I'm going back to bed and you need to get someone to watch him. Have a good day. Dude, we're on a one hour delay. Did you really think I was about to entertain your kid for an extra hour today? Shut that down, quick! In bed, glasses off, n rolled over to sight of Jr climbing in. Told her to get in her bed, she laughed and said "uh, no". Now she's snoring. Happy 11th birthday to my beautiful niece, Shamia Tajae Anthonise.

Jr's color sentences: "I have a black mommy. I have a brown dog. I have purple bick. I have a white teacher." I'm dying laughing. @CroleyMcCoolKid I can dig that. #WizKhalifa #RollingPapers got a #southerndrawl and that makes my heart sing. I don't even smoke and I'm high off this cd. Cleaning house and baking brownies. Had a better diabetic day so I'm rewarding myself. Hush your preaching! Moderation, people. #moderation My chili was fantastic and I am uber excited.

If it makes you feel better I'm walking in freezing weather to karate. @BluTenacity 40 minutes. You can do it!!!! @BluTenacity Hour and a half to go! On page 134 of 672 of The Woman in White, by Wilkie Collins http://t.co/EX96B5PM @BluTenacity 6 mins 22-year old just told me I have #FossilSwag. I'm weak. That just made my day and I haven't even gotten to work yet. Love it! Jr's playing #shrek on #nintendoDS and #pinocchio just did the running man. #wtf @WhosthatCurl Not horrible. Just hilarious. Slightly lame but totally forgivable cause my baby's awesome! @WhosthatCurl Lol. You're tragically hilarious. Get your whole entire life together. @WhosthatCurl Karate is Mondays and Thursdays @WhosthatCurl That blows! Kids at school, about to grab something for lunch, then heading to work. Energized from actually sleeping 5 hrs. Amazingly great feeling! You're ignoring me and it's making me irate. #seethis and knowyoureadouche #passiveaggressive Def disagree. Whatabout dads that pay for everything, have custody, or are just stand up guys without major cash flow? Case by case basis. Almost bedtime. Actually getting sleepy at a decent hour. Yea me! @BluTenacity Like Cottonelle or the stuff at work? Where was this deal? @Smoothbludaddy Thank you! I was watching this with very morbid feelings earlier. Tea and brownies #Weeds season 2. First two #winning. Latter, gets suckier as the season progresses. Is Kevin Nealon still alive? What's the name of the guy who got killed by his wife from Saturday Night Live? Phil something? Maybe Kevin? Someone bring me ice cream Tingly @WhosthatCurl Super Sexy! @WhosthatCurl Yo momma is gonna beat you when you turn 30! All the whoopings you should've gotten but never did. @BluTenacity Except banana. @BluTenacity Definitely do. I like greek yogurt with mango or blueberries on bottom. Blended I like key lime pie most, but will eat any. Four bruthas in a circle: locs, bald heads, goatees, clean shaven, dark, light, fitted, bummy, sneaks, wingtips, talking chinese lit. Sexy! @BluTenacity Whatever flavors you generally like will probably do well, but get blended not fruit on the bottom. It'll be easier to take. @BluTenacity 40 mins will take forever! Muah ah ah ah ah ahhhhhhhhhh! Have you ever just wanted to tell a street performer to stfu?! He is working my nerves. #youcantsingbruh Going to the dentist for jaw pain. Hoping that I come out with a mouthguard and not an appointment for oral surgery. #fingerscrossed My front door was open all night, not unlocked, open.

Don't be surprised when there's no time for. #forewarning #nowyouknow Every decision I make is centered around you yet I'm not even an afterthought though our lives are intrinsically connected. Ain't that some? Yeah. I was impressed when the letter was sent home. Considering I don't have TV, this electronic phone system is awesome! @WhosthatCurl I read my newsletters. What? You think I'm slacking?! Hater!

Maybe. Never fried fish before. Hesitant. Really want potato salad w/ bacon n green onions. Haven't been to sleep. Barely stayed awake for my 6.5 hours @ work. Headed to get Jr then on to karate. Dinner then passing straight out. African American Ball tickets have been purchased. Now to find a dress worthy of my curvaceousness. Trying to show some cleavage. #sexylana Kids at school, 3/10 mile done and 3/10 mile to go. Grab my stuff, do another 3/5 mile and off to work. 1 1/5 miles before work. Not too bad Alarm in 30 seconds My alarm will go off @ 5:20 a.m. and I have not been to sleep. This more than partially sucks. Still up. Now Jr has a nosebleed. At least I have a reason to be awake now. Sucks, but still a reason Happy birthday to my frat round the world. Love those men of Phi Beta Sigma! Happy birthday to my Butter Cookie bestie Jacquelyn Renee! I love you, girlie. Happy born day! I would agree. Not major downfall, more like minor setback. Sprain your left pinky for asking what's a tebow. I'm sad for your life. You have got to be more well-rounded. Dishes done, oven cleaned, half bath cleaned, kitchen done. Time to mop and then on to the living room. #overdrivecleaning #thatsahookrightder All I can say is that you live, you love, and you learn. You see what looks amazing and try it only to realize that's not for you. Try again I AGREE!!! Not justifying, just letting you know it takes time for anyone to appreciate what they've got. "Grass is greener" syndrome. Mudslides and music. Perfect cleaning accompaniment.

Got more presents and a few items for the house. Time to break for lunch then library time. Great day with the young Myss Nyss. @WhosthatCurl Awwww. She senses your maternal nature! Missed breakfast.  Gonna have a gluten free, sugar free, calorie free, msg free, dye free, preservative free, taste free snack. I am not a fan of grocery shopping via public transit.

Does anyone else see a problem with chasing a Seagram's sweet tea shot with a cheeseburger? I'm just asking? I just realized there's a hole on the thigh of my pants, inside thigh. Wouldn't be a problem if I were more ladylike. #teamhorneryhaitisit Nothing more exciting than 5 year old/kindergarten basketball. Kid ran across 2 courts in a zigzag pattern with the ball. #passingdrills End kid's taken a ball to the face. Tears ensued. Her dad's the coach and now he's carrying her. My baby's gangsta! She threw the ball straight up, hit herself in the face, tears and a nosebleed. Yea! Back at it already. My baby. At Jr's first basketball meeting and practice. I definitely think we are going to stick with sports and art as energy outlets. #teamfocused 2nd time some gentleman at #wafflehouse as paid for my food. Thankful. However, I need to up my rate. Lol. Shameful. Early morning running with Jr. #wafflehouseflow then #hoopdreams soon hereafter. Two things: a. someone needs to twist my locs. b. i am so uber sleepy and Jr is not. we're about to lay in the bed, me sleep, her movie. @WhosthatCurl Thanks, Meko! Your watching her is greatly appreciated. And I stingily take credit for all her awesomeness. Thank you! Dude, how much is too much? Come on! ..........*insert sleepy face*......... Excited for the day so trying to stay awake. Let's see how this works out. My daughter is allergic to citrus/citric acid. What is a juice or flavored water that doesn't have citric acid added?

This living room closet is kicking my ace, but I'm about to get it done this weekend. Indian Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark + a bowl of expired corn flakes. Jr's headed to Richmond for a weekend with friends. Good times Ugh So productive earlier it's time to relax. Totally about to nap. Ahhhhh! I'm that person. Creatively typing away on my laptop in the library trying to get the story out. It's been a good few hours. Amen! Cornflakes sucked when I was a kid. Just ate a bowl and loved 'em. Maybe it's cause they expired Sept 16. Who knows? They were superb! Cheshire cat couldn't grin bigger. Turn up the music and continue the cleaning. Let's go! Laundry, kitchen, bathroom. Can we get it all done? Let's see how the music progresses. Go! I have discovered why people drink. Everything is tolerable when intoxicated. Cleaning is kinda fun. Lol. Glass 1=jamming in the kitchen! I need a man.....this trash isn't going to take itself out. Hell, a woman would do for this too. Shoot, maybe just a trained animal. Lazy!

Step out the house right! @belizeank1tty Put some clothes on, Soror! It's dang near the evening. Mu Lambda-no pj's and no scarves. Walk right. Do you tell someone you know doesn't love you that you love them? Do you accept rejection or not admit anything so you don't get rejected? Despite the early morning commuter hiccups, this will be a great day. I can feel it! Now that it's too late to get any worthwhile sleep.....I think I'll go to bed. Good morning my Insomniac Homies. Dead Like Me. Let's do it. Laundry done. Jr's school binder updated, finally (been slipping on that one). Dishes done, gotta sweep and kitchen is complete. Closet, ugh Tea and foreign movies with subtitles as I fold laundry. Not a good combo, but it's my choice. Hush. I lose myself at the library like some people do shopping. Ahhhh. Love books. Now to get my daughter before TCE wonders where I am. The man in front of me has OCD. He's not stopped rubbing his hair back. Does he not notice the bald spot on top?  Cause n effect, bro. You are grossly contagious and I catch strep thinking about a future throat irritation. Sorry homie, healthy throats only. Over 25% of my contacts are Greek or secret society, 20% are non-US citizens or immigrants, 45% are blood relatives/people I call relatives. Someone come clean my house. I just want to read a book, drink tea, and eat breakfast. Jr: I have candy in my backpack. Damari: I have noodles in my packpack, hot noodles. Owee owee! Blue Velvet: one of the weirdest movies on the planet. Kyle MacLachlan: weirdo. ED in Sex & the City was karma for this creepiness. Time to put together treat bags for Jr's class.

This amuses me greatly. #elementarytweet The back of the president's wheelchair says "Quickie". This amuses me greatly. Smiling now I just had cantaloupe and chai for breakfast.

Best In Show One load of laundry to go. It's in the dryer and I am on my way to having a clean downstairs again. Getting it done.
