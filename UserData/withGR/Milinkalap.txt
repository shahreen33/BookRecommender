If you chose to, I'll leave you in the dust. @KreelanWarrior a Kreelan warrior just sliced through her own throat #likeaboss Netflix has spoiled me in that I don't like watching series unless I can binge watch them. @knoxelf bleh to other girl gamers.

This kinda triggers my jealousy a bit. @Nexusbrewery I think I've had Frito Pie there. It was excellent. But too far from home for the drive. @marysangiovanni definitely. Read. Currently reading. To read. You can also add other bookshelves. I have abandoned. Favorite. iPad. @marysangiovanni it's definitely great for that and for finding books that you may like and the reviews are super helpful. @marysangiovanni I LOVE goodreads. It's fantastic! Hungry! Three episodes into Prison Break so far and it's interesting but I don't know if I can see what all the fuss is about. Ugh. I hate the obligatory Facebook friending that I have to allow. #sigh #firstworldproblems Just started watching Prison Break, so no one do any ruining Bored. Watching Netflix with the puppy.

Almost ready for #lfr as if I'll ever run that garbage. #worldofwarcraft #wow #girlgamer Sigh #NoFapNovember is rough. I'm going to grow a cherry back. An #elizabethian cherry. #frustrated @lokoino lol at least you could still text tweets in. @Taamyo sweet. I'm finally starting to do decent damage on my hunter with an ilvl of 457. Took forever. How much longer for #NoFapNovember I don't even care if I #win anymore. I just don't wanna #lose @Taamyo sorry. The extent that I know cameras is on apple products. I don't know why sandals with socks make me so mad but it does. When mp3s became the forefront of music listening you could import CDs, where is that ability for ebooks? Still very much thinking of a haircut. I still woul love a mohawk but lack the balls for it and the daily care. Pretty excited about the #worldwarz movie. I saw the trailer. Need to read the book first. Not too excited it's Brad Pitt though. Ugh. #NoFapNovember was the worst idea. I'm resorting to evil tricks to get someone else to lose.
