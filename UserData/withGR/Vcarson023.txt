Between Fox and Charter the widescreen/letterbox problem has been fixed for tonight's Series game. Your help was key. @CharterJoseph Yes! That fixed the widescreen vs letterbox problem. Now we can see the score for both teams, the inning, etc. Thanks! @CharterJoseph The phone number on the account is 860-423-6457 @CharterJoseph What is the dynamic setting? I have not heard of it.

NFL and World Series wide-screen run off the right/left edges. Not Fox61 fault, they say. @CarlyFOX61 Not sure I understand. Problem on NFL & World Series. GRFX is wide-screen? Charter should automatically convert to letter-box. 3 of 5 stars to The Trespasser by D.H. Lawrence http://t.co/h3DIxy8B @CarlyFOX61 Whenever Fox broadcasts NFL or World Series games, the wide-screen format runs over the left/right edges.

Everywhere away from B-town is good. @CharterEdward When Fox sends Charter a program in wide-screen, give us the signal in letter-box. Same problem today in NFL as in ALCS. @CharterEdward I saw last night's baseball game on Fox on a station in Maine. They showed the game in letter-box.

Go letter-box, Fox! @eringott I read Goodbye Columbus recently, as well.I liked it although I have not liked some of Roth's more recent books. @CharterEdward Ed, Is problem with Fox or with Charter? The wide-screen image runs off the screen of a regular tv if letter-box not used. @freeptigers following on twitter and score mobile @charter Fox broadcasting the ALCS game in wide-screen without using letter-box. We can't see the right or left edge of the picture. Help? #fox why is Fox broadcasting in wide-screen without using letter-box?
