Pope St. John Paul II: "To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ." "The rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the Heart of Jesu, Our Redeemer, Who so love His Mother."-- St. Louis de Montfort. Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary. Nine! St. Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the rosary. Padre Pio: "The rosary is the weapon." Pope Paul V: "The rosary is a treasury of graces." Pope Adrian VI called the rosary the "scourge of the devil." St. John Vianney (the Cure d'Ars) was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand. St. Thomas Aquinas preached for 40 straight says in Rome on just the Hail Mary. St. Francis des Sales said that the greatest method of praying is to pray the rosary.
