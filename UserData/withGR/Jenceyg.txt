Unless I loved the book. #ChickLitChat @carlarichards @traciebanister @lydialaceby @lafleurdeplume  Why? I would not probably give that book a good review. #ChickLitChat @lydialaceby  What happened? #ChickLitChat Stepped away for a moment.  Are we talking about how to write reviews? #chicklitchat @traciebanister @AuthorTamiAkin   Most reviewers are behind unless they have associate reviewers.  I would like it 3 months ahead. #ChickLitChat When an author personalizes a review proposal to me.  I am more comfortable in working with them. #ChickLitChat @traciebanister @JackieBouchard  so agree.  :) #ChickLitChat RT @traciebanister: @JackieBouchard Absolutely! Authors should always try to personalize their review requests. Makes a big difference! #Ch… I know that mine needs some revision.  I do think it is pretty straight forward. #ChickLitChat @traciebanister @lmchap  Yes, it is. #ChickLitChat @JackieBouchard   Agreed.  I wonder if it is the fact that new authors need to know where to look.  #chicklitchat RT @lmchap: Also, personally contacting an author on his or her blog's email is better than a social media contact. #ChickLitChat @traciebanister @lmchap  Agreed.  Can't tell you how many times I have had people send me genres that I don't cover. #ChickLitChat RT @traciebanister: @lmchap Always read each blog's Review Policy &amp; make sure they accept your genre &amp; are currently open to review request… I love when people have a blurb attached and look at my blog to see what genres appear most. #ChickLitChat @lmchap  Ah totally up for that!  #ChickLitChat Good evening!

RT @traciebanister: @liliandarcy @lmchap Ha! We're #1, baby. #ChickLitChat @traciebanister  Have you ever felt like you would want to give up a genre?  Like a genre you read when you were little but not as an adult? @tkrimms   Not to me!  Romances can sometimes seem so predictable.  #chicklitchat @traciebanister @liliandarcy @PatriciaMann11   Don't say that!  I have read book one but haven't gotten around to the others. @traciebanister   I think there can be.  Probably the most major difference is some are contemporary or the past. Oh, yes I forgot contemporary romance. :) #chicklitchat @traciebanister Here are the genres that I like to read other than chicklit:  christian fiction, historical fiction, and a good nonfiction. #chicklitchat I'm here!
