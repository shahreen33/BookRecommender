On a brighter note have like 5 swaps to take to the PO..finally getting some of the stuff I want and getting rid of stuff I dont want.. Just came back from Dr. Just found a very large breast lump so now the fun begins.  It sure would be nice to be healthy even for one day! Ok, last post should have said sit beside her.  I am so exhausted going to the hospital everyday.  She is sedated so nothing really to do Still laying in bed and putting pictures up on MUA to swap.  Decided to stay home today and not go to the hospital and see beside my mom. If I had not worked at a hospital and know as much as I do maybe I would not mind being there but the nurses just piss me off..i am stressed i am so sick of the hospital and everyone that works at it.  My mom is in a med induced sedation due to intubation and she had tears falling @calicosmetics The heck with those people, I have a fake channel and couch bag.  I still paid 60 for each bag so wear it with pride i do Sitting in intensive care at my moms bedside she is still lifesupport and not doing good @LorraineStanick I have been wanting to get season 1 but don't want to pay the $42.00.I have watched the first 3 episodes online great show I was wondering if anyone else went to the stores and received their free item? Just got home from getting my free Makeup and seeing my mom at the hospital and 6 shots in my back.  I am not moving from this chair at all. @LorraineStanick You could put a list on your blog and announce it.  Everytime someone does it on here it all goes really fast.  Any Mac? So do anyone know if we get one makeup total or one from each company..I am headed to the mall tomorrow morning. need to get up and clean and hit the grocery store..I hate feeling this exhausted everyday.  I want to feel normal again. @gypsydancer13 Thanks but can not believe i am this old @pursebuzz Thanks for the freebie! Going to relax tonight and tomorrow going out for my birthday..I am now officially old! @gypsydancer13   If I am a NW 25 for foundation do I buy NW 20 or 25 for the concealor? If I am a NW 25 for foundation do I buy NW 20 or 25 for the concealor? Gypsydancer13 have you tried the coastal scents gel liners they have all the colors and have heard only good about them and cheap What is this about free makeup of the week of the 20th?  I am so there Where are you seeing all this used makeup for sale? I dont believe her for a second but at least I received my $17 dollars back She said she did not know of mac at all.  She had no idea that it was fake she said it was her friends I really want some barbie loves mac..I have none. This was the first time on ebay that I was successful without a huge pricetag I know it was fake because it had a number not the name and it has a secret compartment that had a brush so i know it was fake. she told me to throw it away and that she was sorry. She has refunded my money..she is new only has like 1 star.  she said she does not know mac and was selling it for a friend. Asking for a refund from a ebay seller for selling me a fake barbie loves mac blush!Do they think we are that stupid and not see its fake! gypsy i love the show Big Love but need to see when it comes back on again. I am watching the movie Smokey and the Bandit..hubbys birthday so he is watching what he wants to watch I received my first Nars blush today in orgasm..it is really small why do things on you tube look so much bigger then they really are? @allthatglitrs21 thanks I guess I was lucky it is still in one piece. @allthatglitrs21 is this normal for all mineralized blushes? @allthatglitrs21  I just depotted all my blushes and gleeful which is a mineralized blush did not have a pan I just depotted all my blushes and shadows but when I went to depot my gleeful which is a mineralized blush there was no pan. is this normal @allthatglitrs21 I have a question about depotting will you answer it for me? I have a question..I just tried depoting my blush and tried to poke through my mineralized blush and there is no pan is this normal? Happy New Year everyone! Going to stay in and and have a peaceful night at home together with my husband and of course, You Tube! @allthatglitrs21 All you have to do is buy some thermal like AE have some great ones and just use your scissors and cut the holes out in it. I feel really bad about this, if i kept my mouth shut it would have flown but they said it was flammable and could not go on the plane. Gypsy: If you don't get it tomorrow i will talk to the post office and see what is up with it.  I know that it is a long way from MI to CA Gypsy: I sent it out two weeks ago today..I never thought to get a confirmation, they said it would take two weeks Wondering why there are no good video's up on youtube?  Looking for the guru's videos from christmas but there really is none to speak of. Just finished watching the most stupid movie ever with the family and in-laws..The Zohan with Adam Sandler..horrible gypsydancer13 did you receive my package today? A lot of the two faced at ulta is reduced to 50%.  I bought the California Glamin for $19.99 the brush in it cost $38, I love it.. I can not believe how long it has taken..want me to tell you what is in it? gypsydancer13 did you receive the elf gift yet that I sent you? I will I should receive the mac 150 tomorrow.

I was wondering if anyone bought mac brushes off e-bay I just received 239 and seems pookie not sure if it is real? I have 150 on the way. I also just bought a kit from Laura Geller really good price for a lot of product. Just put in a order for my first Nars blush in Orgasm..I told my husband I just bought a orgasm and he looked confused. Just finished dinner and my little boy to bed and time to see what everyone else is doing. Glad to see my favorites back on youtube today. Why are none of my favorites on youtube this weekend?  What is the black out all about anyway? Oh, well going to bed. sitting on the computer trying to figure out why there is a blackout on youtube
