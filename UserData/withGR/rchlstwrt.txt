Time to read a nice, happy YA book. Are you kidding me, HIMYM? Nine years of watching your show, and that's what you give us? With Kane and Toews both out, I guess it's time to start stanning for Patrick Sharp. Let's take bets on whether my dumbass co-worker will remember that he picked up a shift this morning. Right now the odds are 50:1. And the front page of CNN. But, really...who cares about CNN these days? My hometown made the front page of Gawker b/c someone glued razor blades to playground equipment. Yay? #hometownpride http://t.co/kTxomT5psw RT @AnnaKendrick47: Oh, Sean Bean. Even in National Treasure I'd still hit that. Oh good, more snow. I was afraid we were going to run out. Though, she has to stop dancing in front of a group of pros. It really highlights that she is kind of terrible. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are in Gaga's new video. I kind of love it?? Just when I think I'm out, she pulls me back in. Just got six texts telling me that Chris Brown is going to jail. My friends really get me. Playing Cranium. This is "umbilical cord", so....? http://t.co/ihFYzcrMKN Spending my snow day watching Les Revenants. Yet another show that's going to make me cry at every episode. I'm drunk. My mom actually made it until the end of the ceremony. I cried at least 3 times. See you in a year, Oscars! Alfonso. Another babe. My crush list has quadrupled tonight. Hi, Spike Jonze. You're adorable. RT @vulture: Bobby Lopez, who just won the Oscar for "Let It Go," has completed his EGOT. He's the youngest person ever to do so. RT @TheEllenShow: If only Bradley's arm was longer.
