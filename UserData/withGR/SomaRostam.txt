I am just speaking on the aspect of humanity and peace. @KeepItRealist I'm not a religious person. I just don't believe it's fair to blame all muslims for the actions of a select few. @KeepItRealist well, it seems like you've read a totally different history of Islam from what we have been taught our whole lives @KeepItRealist the religion that these people are following is not our Islam. Islam forbids killing of even ONE person. Thats my point. @mvermi @piersmorgan and how do you know that they aren't what Piers says they are? Have you interviewed them? @KeepItRealist we do not associate ourselves with ISIS. Never did. Never will. We are Muslims. They are not. @KeepItRealist I understand that, but that does not make the generalisations that some people are making justifiable... @KeepItRealist there are extremists in every religion in the world We do not support them neither do we count them as "muslims" I am a muslim.
