The choice is yours. Choose to be happy a few moments today. Then add 1 moment everyday. Do you spend all your talents making yourself feel good today? Hoping that tomorrow will take care of itself? Champions make decisions that create the future they desire. Losers create the present they desire. 21 years ago today, I hit a bottom that changed my life forever. Since then I have been obsessed with my inward journey. Do you have big dreams? You will need uncommon Faith. If you use Hope as a tool it does not matter. It is just a feeling.

The problem is with your vision. Listening to "Father Bill - Spiritual Advisor Caron Foundation" by Todd Weaver on #BlogTalkRadio  http://t.co/fU45gDHw Our habits dictate our future. Choose your habits for a desired outcome. You are in control of your future. My mind is my most valuable asset. For a long time I did not address the physical part of my mind. Keep the body healthy, wisdom comes easy. I am 10% mentor, 90% protege. How teachable are you? Are you proud of your ignorance. We are all doing something stupid, the wise find out what it is sooner. It is easier to keep negative information out, then to evict it after it has entered. What you let enter your ears, determines how you will act and feel. Choose wisely I disliked being 215 lbs-34 waist. I hated 218 lbs-35 waist. I did what was necessary to be 175 with 32 waist. You need to hate your present circumstance to change it. If you only dislike it, it will stay the same. If you can accept sickness and infirmity as the will of God, you will not purse a health diet and body. If you can adapt to poverty, you will never be prosperous. The man who hates poverty, looks for secrets to prosperity, not acceptance that it is the will of God.

Make today a peaceful day. I have seen the future and decided to live there. There clearer your picture the sooner you will get there. Car - model, color, year. Get clear. See your picture everyday.

Today I use words that create good memories. The people you meet... http://t.co/uxy7Wfas How many times have you hurt someone then justified it with the words - but it is true. Words can open doors or build walls. Words can warm a heart or make it cold. Oh, that is not what I meant! Why not use fewer words and mean what you say? God called himself the Word. We profess to love God, yet are very careless with our words. The Indians gauged their own greatness, by the strength of their enemys. If your enemys are weak, so are you. Never advertize the damage the enemy has done. Instead purse wisdom to defeat your enemy. Your enemy is your gift to a promotion. You will never be givin the spoils of war till you conquer this enemy. Your enemy may only be your enemy. Reconize that your enemy is yours alone. Only you need to fight your enemy. Your mountain is any problem you are facing. Talk to it with authority and command it to move and it shall be done. Look at your mountain as a big pile of dirt and small stones. With focused faith it is easily moved. Losers talk about their mountains, Champions talk to their mountains.

Kindness defuses anger. Kindness is the perfect environment where greatness grows. Pour the oil of kindness on those around you and you will become their greatest memory of the day.

Other then frothy emotion, what effort have you put forth? Doubt is the most costly experience on earth. One day of doubt can bring 365 days of misery. Stop advertizing your doubts. Start expecting your goals as a sure thing. Doubt will never produce your desired results. If you want more confidence, get more knowledge. A wise man will hear and increase in learning, a man of understanding shall attain wise counsels Proverbs One key to life is asking the right questions. Labor hard to ask the right questions. Make an appointment with someone and bring questions. Draw from this well Everyone is a well of informations. Drop your bucket into it regularly. Never give more time to a critic, then you would a friend. Either with your mind or your presense. Life is a collection of battles, but it is also a collection of victories. Reach down deep inside and call forth your greatest strengths. I never understood how looking at someone else's suffering, makes you feel good. Telling me that someone else is worse off then me,never motivated me. That is like a boy whistling in the dark, to keep the bogey man away Rosa Parks got angry and did not give up her seat on the bus. What are you doing with your anger? Anger puts us in a prison. Acting out on your anger-physical prison. Meditating on your anger-mental prison. Learn to laugh. Laughter is a powerful medicine that helps us develop better perspectives during stressful situations. If you are having feelings you do not like, you are choosing to keep them. Ahh! You are finding out we choose our feelings. Then decide if we still want them, if not, then find out what we need to do to change them to the feelings we want. The authority figures in our life as a child told us how to feel. As adults we need to re-evaluate these feelings. When a negative thought comes, I imediately turn my thoughts to a positive thought. I have lots of good memorys of others helping me. Your thoughts produce energy. Your energy decides where you go. Where are you going? I like to get a payback on my investments. I do not allow anyone to live rent free in my mind. Remember everyone you meet has recieved waves of criticism, condemnation and rejection. You can change this. Your words of reassurance will water their seeds and bring forth a abundant harvest. Everyone needs assurance that they matter. Extinguish the urge to judge, you may be missing some piece of information that shines new light. Live every day like it is your last. One day you will be right.

Something you need is hidden in someone you do not enjoy. Listening is the only way to recieve it.

Focus on good qualitys of the people around you. You will spend the rest of your days in a flower garden. What you focus on will always determine your feelings. Choose your thoughts wisely. Little responsiblitys is how God qualifies you for intrusting you with his abundance. We use the words small and little to discribe things of unimportance. 100 pennies make a dollar. Do not make the mistake of trivializing small things. Small things can become great things. Laws create more criminals, they do not make anyone honest. People that were just getting by are now criminals. The law is like the axle of a carriage-you can turn it any way you want. Russian Proverb Are you aimless as an Autumn leave? Why? You can change that if you want to. Coaching is easiest why to focus no matter how the wind blows Zeal without judgement is like gunpowder in the hands of a child. Ben Jonson 1573-1637 Doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you are doing.

Proverbs 22:22 Those who do not bring friends to you - will split your existing friendships Those who do not increase you - will always decrease you There are 4 kinds of people-those who add, those who subtract those who multiply, those who divide Abandon your abusive relationships - We are not made in the image of a doormat. Time wasters diminish your energy, limit their access to you. You have a destiny. Small steps get you there. There are 2 things more important then your money. Your energy and your time. Break your goal into tiny steps. You get pleasure being successful. Once the train is moving, it is hard to stop. Take a tiny step to your goal today. Winners are the ones who are willing to move forword an inch at a time. Wisdom requires persistence, time, and effort. It will be worth everything you pay to get it. Learn something new daily. This gives the wisdom to discern the difference in people, opportunitys and moments. The size of your enemy determines the size of your reward. Do not let the enemy pick the time or the weapons you will use. Battle is the opportunity to show your values.
