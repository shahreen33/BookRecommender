Until the whole world knows...... "A father should seek to win the hearts of his children." Quote from the movie Courageous - #lfacourageous @LawtonFirst "Give an encouraging word to everyone you see this week, &amp; see the change it makes." #pastordon @LawtonFirst #lfacourageous (powerful) Pt 4. Solution? 1. Get a new heart 2. Ask God for help 3. Think before you speak (James 1:19) 4. Speak truth in love - @LawtonFirst "If you are speaking harsh words, you have a heart problem." Out of the overflow of a heart the mouth speaks. #lfacourageous @LawtonFirst "The Holy Spirit is the active force that helps us master our words &amp; use our tongues to praise &amp; uplift." #pastordon @LawtonFirst James 3 @RickyHerbert thanks so much my friend P3.

Are we cursing more than praising?" @LawtonFirst James 3:9-12 #lfacourageous "You can assassinate someone with your tongue...your words." #pastordon @LawtonFirst James 3 P2. My tongue can destroy what I have. "Gossip is like a reckless fire. Are we acting like verbal arsonists?" @LawtonFirst James 3:5-6 "We shape our words then our words shape us." #pastordon @LawtonFirst - Point 1. My tongue directs where I go. James 3:3-4 #lfacourageous @lapislazarus 1 and 2 Peter are great letters and powerful teachings about church life and the Christian life!

Great word from @joshbrown22 Pastor Heath bringing it during The Mix Student Ministry series "The Social Network" http://instagr.am/p/EIvh3/ Listening 2 @heathcorrales address Twitter 2 the youth of @MixMinistries for their Social Network series #mixsocialnet  http://t.co/nML2Jew So if Charlie Sheen plays wild & crazy to get attention and Donald Trump plays concerned & serious...are they archenemies? #winning @pwilson praying for you! Challenge everyone's socks off! #catdallas RT @alanhirsch: There!  My buddy Mark Sayers said it for me.  The real problem with Bell's Love Wins http://networkedblogs.com/h8WWZ RT @DisneyInstitute: A8. When our teams are high performing, with little direction from leaders, we've done our job. Community created.  ... RT @stevenfurtick: One reason we struggle w/ insecurity: we're comparing our behind the scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. @jaymeemosesman yes indeed! Every year! @denerway LoL...so true! @Josh2France3 :-) @denerway indeed...just haven't heard the phrase artsy fartsy in a long time OH: I just heard someone refer to @gregerway as the "artsy fartsy" type ... Not sure if that a compliment :-) Being biblically sound and practical in application in #preaching / #teaching is a tension you manage not a problem you solve. #ministry If you can manage your plans stop asking God to...and go find a dream that only God can accomplish through you! #dream #ministry ‚Äú@TimElmore: "Efficiency is doing the thing right.

What is the next book you are going to read (not counting the Bible)? #books #learning #personalgrowth RT @stevenfurtick: Here's @hollyfurtick 's message on humility in relationships from the wknd. It's strong. http://t.co/kyA2raS @AlishaCorrales @heathcorrales appreciate you guys! @MattBKT15 if there is no foreseeable way to refocus on strengths, make the best of it, while creating an exit strategy. Focus on your strengths. People who don't excel are usually too focused on tasks that relate to their weaknesses. #leadership #ministry RT @jimlee00: This Wolverine took a bit longer--for WS art director Larry Berry (I think) I forget lol http://yfrog.com/h2airqij Jim Lee (@jimlee00) did this Wolverine for a buddy years ago http://t.co/hFZ9Q1C || I dig this.
