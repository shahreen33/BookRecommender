I'm have the tendency to plan WAAAYYY ahead though. That can also suck.. @readersrambles I would feel the exact same way!! üòù @MarkTheShaw I'll read basically anything if it seems interesting to me @BookishBFs @City_Of_YA It's finally up!! We're getting SO close now!!! @BBF_Lucy http://t.co/kwcOUc6BtV @NYOOOOMM @readersrambles And the worst part was that it was a morning showing. One kid said: mom? What's that man doing I that lady? @NYOOOOMM @readersrambles I saw the full length trailer in the cinema with my mom. I nearly yelled: Graham... WHY?!!! @NYOOOOMM @readersrambles My image of him is all confused now. I don't know what to think. He used to be my babe in OUaT @NYOOOOMM @readersrambles For sure! It does bother me though that the actor who played Graham now plays Christian Grey in the movie üòñ @readersrambles @NYOOOOMM It's fairy tales. That mash together. Partially with Disney. In an awesome badass way. It's the bestest!!! @aria_pearce @readersrambles Same for me!! I'm sooo behind! @NYOOOOMM @readersrambles OUaT is sooo good. But I'm sooo behind. Still have a LOT to watch. I'm good on PLL though. @readersrambles I start many series and then forget all about them üòÇ. I love Once Upon a Time (c'mon fairy tales!) and Pretty Little Liars üòç @readersrambles I do watch Arrow and have been meaning to start Supernatural. I guess I should finish up on Once Upon a Time first though.. @ABookWorld My mom always reacts the same way! 'Don't you have enough books already??' Nobody can have too many books!!!!! @readersrambles What? Your favorite series? I had NOOOO idea. I'll start tomorrow. Promise üòâ @readersrambles Maybe I should really start watching the 100. I don't get half of the tweets on my timeline anymore üòÇ @MsWoollyWolf yay!! @readersrambles I just watched the announcement video! Was so fun to watch! I can just imagine @BBF_Lucy 's reaction XD Omg only 15 subs away from 200(!!!!). Wow. This is so amazing, you are all fabulous!! üòòüòò And yes!!! After so much trouble it's finally up!! Book Haul #1 | Veronica http://t.co/BTxtm0dWnH @NYOOOOMM I completely agree with all of your last few tweets. Why get mad at someone for liking or disliking a book?! @NYOOOOMM I think it's mostly thanks to our RRALAT haha. It made me read so much! @NYOOOOMM And I've just broken my monthly record!! Haha @readersrambles Dark Triumph and Mortal Heart? üò≥ @readersrambles I also promise to start the series soon! @readersrambles you kinda look like a hamster or chipmunk here haha Do it @NYOOOOMM a book selfie to win a tote bag!! #ivereadthat @IveReadThat http://t.co/vw5DMI6KFC @readersrambles @IveReadThat @BBF_Lucy I'll join!

You (finally) get to see my rearranged shelves!! :) @NYOOOOMM I know right!!! So hot! @LiveLoveReadx Mara Dyer!! Okay. So I managed to finish my second book of the day. An oops? Or an accomplishment? Starting part two in the Darkness Rising series soon. Just finished my second book for the #RRALAT Autumn Rose. RT @City_Of_YA: Booktube Partner TAG Ft. Bookish Best Friends: http://t.co/wV6NaNQor3 via @YouTube @BBF_Lucy Even when we finish books we do it TWARDIS style! Haha Just finished book #1 for the #RRALAT. The Dark Heroine was just as surprising the second time around. Now onto book two, Autumn Rose! @City_Of_YA This is so awesome! My face just looks so confused and sarcastic, love it! Haha @City_Of_YA wohoooo you hit 500!! Congrats love!! Great job, you absolutely deserve it! @NYOOOOMM Hahahaha you're mom is epic! Especially the 'author lady' part @City_Of_YA hell yes! @City_Of_YA it's going to be absolutely awesome!! RT @DutchSpeakwords: It spreads as a walking fire! @BBF_Lucy I should really finish the dark heroine as well haha #RRALAT @readersrambles Deal then! And he is isn't he? I also loved beast sooo much! He is hilarious @readersrambles Me too!! And what were your thoughts on it? Want to read the other two together perhaps? @readersrambles I think so too! We definitely seem to have similar tastes in books, so I have such high hopes! @readersrambles And if it is like Throne of Glass I'll definitely have to start that one soon!! Now that I own all three haha @readersrambles Completely understand!! I had the same feeling. It isn't as bad as others I've read though. It's pretty informal haha @readersrambles I'm so happy that you love it! I'm always afraid that people will hate my recommendations üò£ So yay! @readersrambles Do you really want to find out from me? Spoiler alert üòù @readersrambles Indeed! Just don't let anyone else's opinions matter if you want to read a book or not! It's usually a recommendation! @readersrambles I loathe it when people say that. Just go in with little expectations of what it will be like and form your own opinion!! @BookLikeLieke @MissDaphneML This sounds like a really interesting topic for a readathon, I'm in! After the #RRALAT though haha üòù @MsWoollyWolf @MsWoollyWolf You're right on time! Let's start the #RRALAT together! http://t.co/PxI4M19JZ5 @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy Ohhh yeah... That could've gotten ugly üòã @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy It really is great! Even I we spam each other to death during WIDM haha @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy  Ahhh get it! It is a great way to meet people. We're the proof of that! Haha @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy Smart way to do it if you get to weirded out by telling them directly! Props to you! @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy ohhh that's clever!! Sneaky you! @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy I'm pretty much the same way. But everyone I've told, even some classmates, were so helpful and enthusiastic!! @BBF_Lucy @LiveLoveReadx I think my mom is my biggest fan though üòú @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy I do believe that would help yes. You really should though. It's hilarious, we do have to edit more I think... @BBF_Lucy @LiveLoveReadx Last night totally proved that! üòù Somebody actually asked haha @LiveLoveReadx @BBF_Lucy it really is!! We get even more synched with another since we're doing this üòù and people already find it creepy üò≥ @BookLikeLieke and that saved money can go to more fun books! üòâ haha @LiveLoveReadx Believe me. Having @BBF_Lucy there to randomly chat to really helps!! I think my most awkward video is my 25 facts... @LiveLoveReadx true. You get used to the camera in a pretty short amount of time. But the first ones. Brrr @LiveLoveReadx I can get that. Even though our first video wasn't that long ago, I just seem to look so awkward when I watch it haha @LiveLoveReadx Darn it!!! @LiveLoveReadx And this is precisely how you get me curious haha üòùüòò @kat_tastic thanks! I might lean more to your side of things though. I just got 18 new books (oops?) and I'm too lazy to put them in the jar Me and @BBF_Lucy have a special video uploading now!! Can't wait to see what you all think of our silliness üòú. It's bad this time haha @kat_tastic I loved the way you planned for 2015! It is much more flexible than a TBR jar like I have!
