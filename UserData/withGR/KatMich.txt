No problem, I'll explain to you what (an easily Google-able thing is) and why we care/it matters. My hourly rate is __, here's my PayPal. A tactic I enjoy seeing: Asking for payment in exchange for an education on an easily google-able question about a marginalized group. Don't expect someone else to educate you if you're not willing to do the work to educate yourself. One way I would suggest getting better is following more "diverse" voices on social media and reading their books. LEARN for yourself. Also, it should not be marginalized' job to ask "what was meant?" What was meant doesn't matter, what was received is what matters. I wish it had been about how do we get better about LISTENING and hearing and learning from marginalized people? And believing them? Was encouraged to see the audience call them out.
