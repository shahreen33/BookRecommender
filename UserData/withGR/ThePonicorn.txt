Are seals capable of violence? The  first song may or may not have been @thalia's Piel Morena I may or may have not created a playlist named "90's Teen latina girl" Guys... Why? There are typos... If there's any typo here, just deal. You have me here every day... Sharing, sharing, sharing... I know you needed to know all of this... Because we know that I share everything, my friends... Why did I remember this? I can't sleep and I just realized I'm thirsty... ... But I don't want to go the kitchen... Are you wearing the right pajamas? Is the TV too loud? Usually this covers everything that makes me stay up. (Cont) How are your pillows? Are you sleeping on the right pillow? Are your blankets heavy? Are there too many blankets? Are you thirsty? (Cont) And I make a mental list of all the things that I know make me uncomfortable to sleep Are you wearing socks? Take them off. (Cont) After getting upset for a while I eventually just close my eyes a day stay there quiet. &amp; I think "what the hell is my body needing?" (Cont) But somehow I can't get there and I just remain in bed rolling around, I've gotten to the point I finally know what to do (cont) I've reached a milestone in adulthood: When I'm very very tired and I want to sleep and my body is basically on sleep mode (cont.)

Letting go of things is an ongoing process and I'm still letting go of grudges. I am happy. Really happy. I may not be at my best But having it when I'm not looking for it, was kind of pleasantly unexpected. I am a grown woman and I have my own life experience so I don't need anyone's validation to know I'm in the right. And the only thing I could get out of it was the certainty that I was not alone. And today I guess I felt the same. I felt understood. I am happy. Really happy. About a couple of months ago I had a similar conversation with someone who had been through similar things And strangely doing do made me feel at Peace. I am calm. I know my life is on a better place right now. I know I am healthier now. So.

And I'm excited and she was so excited about me. Damn... Remember how I've been mentioning things about cycles and all? Well, from January on my life will be different. Today I was able to congratulate her, offer her a deal on something we want to collaborate upon and share some things about my future Regardless of how hard things seemed. I'm so proud of her. About 1.5 yeara ago I had a conversation with her that made me feel I was making the right choices about my life A friend who is going to Japan in about two months to show her work and give a conference Today I had a long conversation with someone who is very dear to me.
