My long and interesting (I think so anyway) interview with @samamidon about his new album Bright Sunny South: http://t.co/kkbH31NKB6 Album Review: Sam Amidon - Bright Sunny South (2013 LP) | the AU review http://t.co/xVyO2TKyU2 via @theAUreview @basementfever How's The Great Escape? @miniweetabex what colour did you end up getting? @miniweetabex Nice! What were you doing up in deepest darkest Exeter? Road trippin' to GTM Bunbury. Majorly looking forward to @FRabbits this afternoon! I'm at Boubar (Nedlands, WA) http://t.co/dsyiG83tsp RT @AdrianEdmondson: Sun still beating down mercilessly here in Perth WA... http://t.co/wYeQb72i4H Beth Orton (@ St Joseph's Catholic Church) http://t.co/d0dgGQTm9f @astortheatre guessing a potential splendour sideshow? @adamhillscomedy Born to Saunter @iamlonewolf the soundtrack track-listing was enough to put me off. @miniweetabex my thoughts exactly @miniweetabex I passed someone when on the way to work the other morning, looked about 12, driving a fucking convertible. know the feeling. @miniweetabex Is this some sort of code? the AU interview: Camperdown &amp; Out (Sydney) | the AU review http://t.co/Kvgr4JEkfE via @theAUreview Theatre Review: Death in Bowengabbie - The Blue Room Theatre (27.04.13) | the AU review http://t.co/uO5TWG4o8h via @theAUreview @jonogurney not at the moment - on the hunt for a sponsor now. @jonogurney glad one of us is @echoz because they've had so much luck when it comes to beating the aussies ;) @echoz Theres a few other plays from different countries in the main squad. But he could effectively field a whole welsh team if he wanted. @AdmiralFallow Hope it's the first of many tours! Is anyone really surprised that the Wales head coach picked a mostly Welsh side for his Lions team? the AU interview: Hamish Anderson (Melbourne) | the AU review http://t.co/j05ITff58w via @theAUreview I'm at The Blue Room Theatre http://t.co/842OT5Ke8F I'm at Boubar (Nedlands, WA) http://t.co/o9HCI0S4x0 @jonogurney Reckon it's a grower though. There are plenty of songs I love so far. @jonogurney Haven't had chance to give it a full and proper listen through yet, but first thoughts is it's not as immediately singalongable Ah the Splendour line up, so many great bands. Wonder how many will actually do full tours of the country, I'm at C15 Espresso (Applecross, WA) http://t.co/YvNJX3ImQN @jonogurney well thats most of it then. @jonogurney hmm maybe they got it a little bit earlier then, only released in the UK today. Is it fantastic? @jonogurney which itunes store? wasn't available when i preordered it on the UK one yesterday. @jonogurney I only got round to pre-ordering it yesterday. Where did you download it from? Yay Tape Deck Heart is downloading. That'll tide me over till the LP comes in. @BatgirlElimy buy books, buy books I'm at Raffles Hotel (Applecross, Western Australia) http://t.co/FrREzPQEKd My Record Store Day haul for 2013 #rsd13 http://t.co/zKXBPBApTc @miniweetabex There can be only one Port Eliot! I'm going to make sure I am around long enough to catch it next year. @BatgirlElimy That was a mildly painful process... but you have a vote from me. @basementfever not a lot by the looks of it. @basementfever http://t.co/sfrG3qUxM5 @miniweetabex I meant Lit Fest,no music though &amp; a higher proportion of Telegraph readers. But the talk I went to last year was interesting. @BatgirlElimy 2 were RSD exclusives. Missed out on one that I wanted, but they think they might get more. Plus a couple didn't come in. @farumphry Never heard much of their stuff, but been told they're good. @BatgirlElimy Nick Drake reissue, new Iron &amp; Wine, new Charles Bradley and Of Monsters and Men 10" EP @farumphry which album is that? @miniweetabex you could always come up to the one in Dartington with me for a day? Goodbye $$$ #rsd13 I'm at 78 Records (Perth, WA) http://t.co/kFnTNlz5cw Happy Record Store Day folks! Go out and support your local store! #RSD13 the AU guide to Record Store Day: VIC Edition | the AU review http://t.co/Yn8SJKXbMV via @theAUreview @miniweetabex outrageous isn't. Breakfast and a wander through the gardens perhaps. @miniweetabex It's not too bad, just needs a vacuum mostly. When I return in June we shall breakfast somewhere. @miniweetabex Not really, got to clean the house ahead of rent inspection on Monday. Breakfast with friends on Sun is my only relaxation. @miniweetabex the honest, realistic, faux kind...? I'm ok. Knackered, been a busy week at work. @miniweetabex @BruisedegoJames you may have to try ;)
