Your 1st lei ever? maybe while I'm home alone 2nite I'll make 1 from dandielions. went to bookclub to discuss The White Tiger. Now home watching Becoming Jane and cooking Greek Skillet Lasagna. Still feel crappy.ugh. @cavecibum I've been eager to read it for awhile so I was mega-excited when my book club picked it for the May read. @BooksOnTheBrain any copies of Two Years, No Rain still available? I was super-busy @ work yesterday & didn't get a chance to send an email. @KaliAlli I didn't know you did music videos too. do you put things like *drum solo*??? @suethepirate Friendly's often causes that sort of regret for me a well. ;) I think only kids are supposed to eat there. or something. @pinkstripes I am really looking forward to the mango bread.  MmmMango.   I am most likely going to make it tomorrow afternoon. can't wait! I don't feel so hot this morning but I am listening to some cheesy 80's pop to perk myself up.

I hope that you are ok! Enjoyed Star trek last night... In retrospect, Sour Patch Kids and lemonade are not the best snack bar combo option. Pucker up! tart crust for lemon tart is chilling in the freezer. Here are some toasted almond lemon bars to tide you over: http://eaturl.info/7cvx on the cooking docket for today: Dorie's tartest lemon tart, more kofta kebabs, chick pea fries, and dipping sauces.

Tiramisu cake http://eaturl.info/uaux --- maybe not a traditional cinqo de mayo dessert but still a decadant treat. Cajun chicken buritto was alright, but it had green peas in it. I've never seen that before... Maybe that's Viva Buritto's schtick. ordered a cajun chicken burrito from Viva Burrito since that is where work-guys were ordering from. We'll see how it is... @KaliAlli I always recall that crazy drink we made at your place from coconut rum and sprite. weirdest.drink.evah. mixmasters we were not. @KaliAlli I'm always talking about food too. Or books. I knew I liked you for a reason. ;) I am heading home to assemble my tiramisu cake. Followed shortly there after by me eating said cake. @cavecibum I would love to see Chuck Palahniuk too.
