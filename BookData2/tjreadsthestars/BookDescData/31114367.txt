'What kind of circus is only open at night?'The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. The black sign, painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, reads:
  Opens at NightfallCloses at Dawn
As dusk shifts to twilight, tiny lights begin to flicker all over the tents, as though the whole of the circus is covered in fireflies. When the tents are aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign lights up: 
  Le Cirque des RÃªvesThe Circus of Dreams.
The gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.
  Now the circus is open. Now you may enter.
