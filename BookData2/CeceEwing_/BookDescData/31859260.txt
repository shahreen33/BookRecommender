Finally, all parts of the Axiom Series come together in one book. Generations ago, the human species was driven to the brink of extinction, forcing those who remained to flee to the city of Axiom; a utopian paradise where all your decisions are made for you. The house you live in, your occupation, and even your marriage arrangement are all regulated by the Assembly, leaving the pressures of free will far behind you. As Annabella Bower enters her last year of schooling, and the final step to adulthood, she's blissfully unaware of the horrors her perfect city hides, but all that's about to change. A spark between 'Ella' and her new dorm-mate Carly turns her world upside down, and opens her eyes to the harsh reality around them. Suddenly she can see students are dying, there's a rebel group rising outside the school walls, and if anyone discovers her relationship with Carly, the consequences are dire. With graduation quickly approaching, Ella will have to make the hardest decision of her life- either continue to follow the laws of Axiom, or give up everything for love.
