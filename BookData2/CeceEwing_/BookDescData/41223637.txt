It’s not your typical family vacation when Olive, and her adopted siblings Darwin and Charlotte find themselves falling into other worlds as they explore Grandma Lupé’s strange hotel.OPEN THE DOOR. ADVENTURE AWAITS.  Olive and her adopted siblings Charlotte and Darwin are spending the summer with their estranged grandma at her creepy hotel and it’s all work and no play. They’re stuck inside doing boring chores but they soon stumble upon an incredible secret... Behind each room door of the hotel lies a portal to a different strange and mysterious place. The simple turn of a knob transports them to a distant magical world filled with space pirates. Behind the next door are bearded wizards. Down the hall is a doorway to a cotton-candied kingdom. But once the doors are opened, worlds start colliding, and only one family can save them before they tear themselves apart.  Written by Terry Blas (The Amazing World of Gumball) and illustrated by the talented Claudia Aguirre (Kim &amp; Kim), this world-hopping fantasy tale breaks down the door to imagination and dares you to embrace the idea that family is everything.
