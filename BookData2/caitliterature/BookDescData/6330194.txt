Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is the original romantic comedy, brimful of wit an wisdom. When the haughty and aristocratic Darcy refuses to dance with Elizabeth Bennett, she instantly dislikes him, despite his reputation as a wealthy and eligible bachelor. Are her first impressions correct, or is there more to Darcy then meets the eye? Sharply observed and sparklingly funny, this is one of the most delightful love stories ever written.
