A holistic vision for a new economic paradigm, founded in feminine and feminist principles. Transmuting the tensions between feminism and Capitalism, Proposals for the Feminine Economy gives us a roadmap forward by insisting that business can be a site of feminist practice if we embody our values, create new economies, and experiment with redistributions of power &amp; resources. Practical, poetic prescriptions for feminismâ€™s fourth wave.
