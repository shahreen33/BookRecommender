Yes Here she is at Christmastime Complete with tinsel and holly Singing fa la la la lolly And over the roar of the jingle bells You can hear hear hear her say It's absolutely Christmas But I don't mind a bit I give everyone a present For that's the thing of it So when it's everly Christmastime And you're under your Christmas trees Simply tinkle a bell and have a trinkle And remember MeEloise
