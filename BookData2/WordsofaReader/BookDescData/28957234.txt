Classic tales by Laura Ingalls Wilder about life on the frontier and America's best-loved pioneer family. Teaching at the Brewster settlement, miles away from her family, isn't as exciting as Laura Ingalls had hoped and she is very homesick. The winter passes slowly and she has only rare drives in Almanzo Wilder's new pony trap to look forward to. As Laura leaves her childhood behind and turns to the responsibilities of earning her keep, her friendship with Almanzo blossoms into love and we say goodbye to the Ingalls family with a wedding. The timeless stories that inspired a TV series can now be read by a new generation of children. Readers who loved Anne of Green Gables, Little Women, and Heidi will be swept up by this timeless rural coming of age saga. Perfect escapism for readers aged 8+. Beautifully illustrated by Garth Williams. Have you collected all the Little House books?
