Percy Bysshe Shelley(1792-1822) was one of the leading romantic poets and a radical in politics. His personal life was tumultuous as his first wife died just five years into the marriage and his relationship with his talented second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, was often fractious. Unadmired during his own short life, his poetry acquired an immortal reputation.
