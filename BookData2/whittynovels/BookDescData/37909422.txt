  Bravery lives inside all of us...
Mateo Morales hasn’t cried since that night, the night he woke up to screaming, the night the police were at the front door, the night his older sister was killed by a police officer… the night his world shattered. Two weeks later, thirteen-year-old Mateo still doesn’t understand why this had to happen, why he hasn’t cried, and who he should blame for the loss of his beloved sister. As he attempts to navigate his life at school and with his family, the media quickly turns the blame on Lily and Mateo feels angry and helpless and he’s not alone. His sixteen-year-old sister Nina is taking out her frustration on Mateo, his parents are treating him like he’s made of glass, and his friends Queenie and Marcus are trying to help get justice for Lily. In a world of constant injustice, Mateo must find his voice and figure out a way to fight for his sister.Inspired by the countless people of color lost to police brutality &amp; injustice every day, Brave Like Lily takes the reader through the trials of grief, loss, and injustice through the eyes of a young Mexican-American boy.
