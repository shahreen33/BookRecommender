Meet Hollywood Bliss Winterman (Holly to her friends). She's the daughter of mega pop-idol Kandhi - the unbelievably famous singer and tenth-richest woman in the world. From the outside, it might look like Holly has the perfect life, but being the average daughter of rock royalty is anything but blissful.Holly's life is turned upside-down when Kandhi receives some threatening letters, yanks Holly out of boarding school, and traps her in the ultra-luxurious Royal Trocadero Hotel - supposedly for her own protection. All this mother-daughter bonding leads Kandhi to turn Holly into a mini-version of herself - even though Holly really wants to become a vet. And then there's Shug, Holly's least favourite person in the world but the only boy she ever sees. Will Holly ever have a normal life, despite her abnormal mother?
