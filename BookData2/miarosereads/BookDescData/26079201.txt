Hope has a deadly secret… Even though mortals think the gods have disappeared . . . Olympus still rules. Demigods have elite hunters who viciously kill monsters. And shadow-demons from the Underworld, the very harbingers of death, are tracking her. When tragedy destroys the only safety she’s ever known, all signs point to Hades’s demons. Or do they? Something doesn’t add up, and Hope needs answers. But now, someone knows she exists . . . Forced to hide, Hope pretends to be normal. She’ll do whatever it takes to keep her secret safe— and her heart protected. But when Athan arrives, her world is turned upside down. With gods, demigods, and demons closing in, the question is… How long can a monster stay hidden in plain sight? Join Hope on her unforgettable journey to discover what it means to live and her daring fight to break Apollo’s curse. *Previously released as Curse of the Sphinx.* Perfect for readers who love the adventure and romance of Cassandra Clare’s The Mortal Instruments and the mythology of Rick Riordan's Trials of Apollo.
