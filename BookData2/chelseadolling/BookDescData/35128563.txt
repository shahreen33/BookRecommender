There’s a first time for everything.First time playing quarters. First time spinning the bottle.First totally hot consensual truck hookup with a superhot boy whose digits I forgot to get. First time getting pregnant.Surprised you with that one, didn’t I?Surprised me, too. I’d planned to spend senior year with my bestie-slash-wifey, Devi Abrams, graduating at the top of my class and getting into an Ivy League college. Instead, Mom and I are moving in with my battle-ax of a grandmother and I’m about to start a new school and a whole new life.Know what’s more fun than being the new girl for your senior year? Being the pregnant new girl. It isn’t awesome. There is one upside, though—a boy named Leaf Leon. He’s cute, an amazing cook and he’s flirting me up, hard-core. Too bad I’m knocked up with a stranger’s baby. I should probably mention that to him at some point.But how?It seems I’ve got a lot more firsts to go.
