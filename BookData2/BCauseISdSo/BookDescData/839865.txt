A daughter of the forest and loyal to no clan, Seana has been whispered to be a child of the faeries, but not even a little Gael magic can help her claim what she truly desires--a home and hearth... before it's too late for her ailing Da.Seana pins all her hopes on Broc Ceannfhionn, and to win Broc's heart, she strikes a bargain with Colin Mac Brodie--the biggest rogue in all of Scotia. Although Colin has already broken Seana's heart once... this time around, he's powerless to resist the girl he once shunned... and he finds himself where he never thought to be... on bended knee.
