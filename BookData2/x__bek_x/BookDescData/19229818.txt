The monster showed up just after midnight. As they do. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting. He's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the one he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments, the one with the darkness and the wind and the screaming... This monster is something different. Something ancient, something wild. And it wants the most dangerous thing of all from Conor. It wants the truth. Costa and Galaxy Award winner Patrick Ness spins a tale from the final idea of SiobhDowd, whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself. This internationally best-selling novel is extraordinarily moving tale of love, loss and hope, from a multi-award-winning writer.
