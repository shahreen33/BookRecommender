Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most cruel.But this year, there's a ninth girl. And instead of paper, she's made of fire.Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. Ten years ago, her mother was snatched by royal guards, and her fate remains unknown. Now, the guards are back, and this time it's Lei they're after - the girl whose golden eyes have piqued the king's interest.Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learn the skills and charm that befit being a king's consort. There, Lei does the unthinkable - she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life and Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide just how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.TW: violence and sexual abuse.
